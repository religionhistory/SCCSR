# Overview
Data curation for Standard Cross-Cultural Sample of Religion (SCCSR.v1) provided under CC-BY-4.0 license. 

This consists of seven `.csv` files of different elements of the database. The variables of each table are documented in the [README file](https://github.com/religionhistory/drh-data-dump/blob/main/data_clean/README.md) in `data_clean`. 


Name | Description
 --- | --- 
[answerset.csv](./data_clean/answerset.csv) | The complete answerset for published entries in the Database of Religious History (DRH). It is connected to other tables through the `question_id`, `entry_id` and `region_id` columns. 
[entry_data.csv](./data_clean/entry_data.csv) | Metadata for entries published in the Database of Religious History (DRH). This is connected to other tables through the `entry_id` and `region_id` columns.
[region_data.csv](./data_clean/region_data.csv) | Region information. The `gis_region` column contains the raw multipolyogons. Regions are assigned a unique `world_region` based on the closest world region by country overlap.
[entity_tags.csv](./data_clean/entity_tags.csv) | Entity tags. Tags are hierarchically structured (see the `entrytag_level` and `entrytag_path` columns). An entry (`entry_id`) can have multiple tags. 
[questionrelation.csv](./data_clean/questionrelation.csv) | The relationships between questions. The Database of Religious History (DRH) employs multiple polls, and some questions are related across polls, (either as a question with exactly the same wording or a similar question). 
[literacy_recode.csv](./data_clean/questionrelation.csv) | Editorially recoded values for **Written Language** answers for the **Religious Group (v5)** and **Religious Group (v6)** polls. 
[social_complexity_recode.csv](./data_clean/questionrelation.csv) | Editorially recoded values for **Social Complexity** answers for the **Religious Group** and **Religious Text** polls.

### Data Curation
* Scripts to extract data in `data_dump` (extracted to `data_raw`). The database backup is too large the include, so analysis can be reproduced from the extracted tables in `data_raw`. 
* Data curation done in `process_data` (writing to `data_clean`). 
* The preprocessed tables are documented in the [README file](data_clean/README.md) in `data_clean`. 

## Affiliation and Funding
The DRH is housed at the University of British Columbia, and has been funded by generous grants from Canadaâ€™s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), The John Templeton Foundation, and Templeton Religion Trust.
