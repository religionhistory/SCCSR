## <a name="table-valuescsv"></a>Table [answerset.csv](./answerset.csv)

This table lists the complete answerset for published entries in the Database of Religious History (DRH). It is connected to other tables through the `question_id`, `entry_id` and `region_id` columns. 

This table has no primary key since the answerset is across both questions (`question_id`) and entries (`entry_id`); additionally, distinct answers can be given for particular date ranges (`year_from`, `year_to`), regions (`region_id`), and `branching_questions`. Different experts (`expert_id`) can provide different answers to the same (`entry_id`, `question_id`) combination, or the same expert might provide different answers. Some questions ask the expert to select all that apply or to list all sources (which can result in multiple answers for the same `entry_id`, `question_id` combination).
