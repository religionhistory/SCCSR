211,Amarna Religion,35,Religious Group (v5),"Tell el-Amarna is the modern name for the ancient city, Akhetaten. It was created by Amenhotep IV, who would later change his name to Akhenaten. This ruler emphasized the role of the god Aten, promoting the belief that this god was primary among all other gods in ancient Egypt, and presented himself as the god's one true prophet and intermediary. This meant that the other Egyptians were cut off from direct access to their gods. At this time in Egyptian history, the god Amun had become particularly prominent, and Akhenaten's workers moved through Egypt erasing the name of Amun (as well as his divine family members, Mut and Khonsu). Aten is the solar disk, and so the religion of this period, often referred to as Amarna Religion, emphasizes solar elements. Access to light and sun were central to the practice of Amarna Religion, including leaving temple spaces open. This period is a dramatic and short break from the normal state of affairs in ancient Egypt. After Akhenaten's death, traditional religion was returned to Egypt, with considerable efforts to erase any references to Akhenaten, or, ""that fallen foe from Amarna"". The city of Akhetaten was abandoned, which has left it well preserved for modern excavators. In modern periods, Amarna Religion has often been seen as the earliest monotheistic religion, though this is an oversimplification of at least religious practice at this time. While Akhenaten promoted the Aten as the most important god, and then the only god, there is significant evidence for the worship of other gods at this time, particularly in domestic contexts, including at Amarna. There is therefore evidence that not all Egyptians followed the ideas put forward by Akhenaten. Sigmund Freud, however, who was an avid reader of the Egyptologist James Henry Breasted, identified Amarna as the source of biblical monotheism, which is a big reason that this period is so well known by the public.",-1350,-1320,34,707,Caroline Arbuckle,2015-04-08 18:45:44.060 +0200,2022-03-11 19:18:39.657 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

294,Xuanxue 玄學,35,Religious Group (v5),"""Arcane learning” [xuanxue] was the dominant discourse of the 3rd to the 6th centuries CE in China, which not only linked essential features of Daoist metaphysics with Confucian morality and political philosophy to create a new world view, but also served as the basis for how concepts of Buddhism were received and developed in China. Later, such concepts and terminology made their way, either directly or via Buddhism, into the formulation of Neo-Confucianism during the Song era (10th-13th centuries CE). Adherents of the xuanxue tradition such as Wang Bi and Guo Xiang are usually referred to in contemporary and later Chinese sources as belonging to the ""Daojia"" (""Men of Dao."" An older term for this movement, ""Neo-Daoism,"" is now considered misleading, since it suggest that xuanxue is primarily a renewal of the pre-Han thought of the Laozi aand Zhuangzi and fails to account for the amalgamation of that tradition of thought with many tenets of Confucianism. Xuanxue thinkers also belong more to the ""philosophical Daoism"" camp than to the ""religious Daoism"" tradition, though distinctions between the two are often ambigious and much interaction was occurring during the age of xuanxue dominance in intellectual and spiritual life. Moreover, major thinkers such as Wang Bi and Guo Xiang seem never to have engaged in such Daoist religious activities as alchemy, hygiene, magic, religious ritual, or any quest for ""transcendence"" or ""immortality"" (xian). Instead, xuanxue thinkers might also be called ""Dao scholastics"" and their tradition of thought as ""School of the Dao."" Xuanxue thinkers varied significantly in their beliefs, and the most important distinction is exemplified by how Wang Bi and Guo Xiang thought of the Dao. Whereas both regarded the Dao as a kind of blueprint or program for the generation, properties and behavior of everything, Wang Bi thought that the Dao was both transcendent to and imminent in things, Guo Xiang rejected this completely and insisted that the Dao was only immanent and had no existence apart from things.

378,Bahinabai Chaudhari's Songs: A Performance Tradition in Maharashtra,35,Religious Group (v5),"Bahinabai Chaudhari, popularly remembered as Bahinai, was born in an agrarian village in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra. She had three sisters and three brothers and was married off at the age of 13 to a Vatandar (landowning farmer) - Nathuji Chaudhari. Nathuji was 30 when he married Bahinai; Bahinai was 30 when she was widowed. 

Bahinai could not read or write. She spent most of her life toiling in farms and kitchens; as a widow, she did the same with the additional burden of clearing her husband’s financial debt. In this context of everyday labor, Bahinai sang a genre of song called ovi - short, rhyming, rhythmic couplets. She sang in the Khandeshi-Varhadi dialect of Marathi (also called Ahirani). Her songs were preserved and published posthumously by her son, Sopandev, and have since been a topic of academic writing and popular representation in films and school textbooks. 

Of the many themes that these songs address, Bahinai's devotion and love (bhakti) for Vitthal (an avatar of Krishna worshipped by Varkaris) is persistent. I, therefore, think that exploring her performance tradition in the disciplinary context of religion could raise important questions - what were the different ways of worshipping Vitthal in Bahinai's immediate context? Why did she sing ovis in the midst of everyday labor like grinding grain and threshing wheat? Are these activities 'religious' or 'folk' or both or neither? Do larger categories like Hinduism elucidate Bahinai's songs at all? And what are the gendered aspects of this genre - in terms of its history and contemporary practice?

The following questionnaire is a rudimentary attempt to address these questions.",1880,1951,814,362,Rohini Shukla,2016-10-05 07:00:00.000 +0200,2023-03-26 06:21:05.381 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Though such rites are prefigured by techniques found in the Vedas, Epic, and Legal literature--especially those practices labeled sorcery (abhicāra), root-work (mūlakarman), and medicine craft (auṣadhi)--the full bloom of Śaiva magic is found in the tantras.  Magic is not to be confused with the perfections (siddhis) displayed by thaumaturges (siddhas) or the yoga powers displayed by perfected strivers (yogīs); magic is the realm of the, often singular, ritual practitioner (sādhaka).",800,1500,689,464,Aaron Michael Ullrey,2017-06-26 15:23:09.884 +0200,2017-11-17 14:55:22.808 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Jain magic coerces worldly supernatural beings, slays enemies, manipulates sexual partners, casts out and away afflicting entities, manages snakes and snakebite, and much more.  Absent are hallmarks of Hindu and Buddhist tantra such as soteriological rites, attaining yoga powers, cultivating meditative states, antinomian practices, and so forth.

442,Donatism,35,Religious Group (v5),"Donatism emerged in North Africa as a result of disagreements over the proper way to deal with Christians who lapsed during the persecutions. Against the mainstream, Donatists argued that the lapsed could never re-enter the Church.

A contested episcopal election of 311, in which the Donatists and the Catholics each elected their own bishop, led to the Donatists appealing to Constantine in 313 to determine the rightful bishop. Constantine sided against the Donatists. From 317-321, he ordered their suppression using measures akin to those of the persecuting emperors: confiscating property, exile, and death. A brief but violent revival of the persecution occurred in 347-348 under his son, Constans. The emperor Julian (361-363) supported Donatism and brought Donatist bishops back from exile as part of a broader program to undermine Catholic Christianity. 

Augustine of Hippo often wrote against them, and the Council of Carthage in 411 also condemned them. Nevertheless, Donatists made up the majority of North African Christians from the fourth to fifth centuries.

The second wave arrived nearly a thousand years later during the Ch’ing (Manchu) dynasty beginning in 1634 (Barfield 1992; Heissig 1980). Arguably, another wave currently in progress was marked by the demise of the Soviet Union. During their repression of Buddhism in the form of executions and the destruction of lamaseries (Mänchen-Helfen 1992: 107), the Soviets destroyed Tyva’s center of Buddhism—the Üstüü Khüree temple in 1937.

472,Karma Kagyu or Kamtsang Kagyu,35,Religious Group (v5),"Karma Kagyu (Tib: karma bka' brgyud) is one of the major lineages of the Kagyud school of Tibetan Buddhism. Dusum Khyenpa (dus gsum mkhyen pa) or the 1st Karmapa (1110-1193) founded the lineage in the 12th century in Tibet by nurturing thousands of students and building three major monasteries as his main seats. In the Tibetan spiritual history, he was known as the first reincarnated lama (Tibetan sprul sku: Taking rebirth consciously and on purpose) of Tibet. After receiving profound meditation instructions from Gampopa (1079-1153), his principal teacher, he meditated over sixteen years on the snowy mountains of Kampo Gangra and Tsurphu and conquered his inner channels and breathe, which means he found a survival skill without depending on the outer world. His fame and teachings soon spread all over Tibet, thus, many students, i.e. scholars, Yogis, merchants, and farmers, gathered together around him for seeking his teachings. 

Teachings of the lineage mainly focused on a particular method of unifying Mahamudra meditation with Six Yogas of Naropa. Besides that the school practices vast and various sutra and tantra teachings within both monastic and lay audiences. Because of the group identity, monasteries, and the selected teaching transmissions, etc, the lineage was transformed into a systematic school after the Karmapa's death. The lineage has continued for around nine hundred years within the Asian countries. Recently, after 1959, led by the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981), the glory of Karma Kagyu reached an international audience. As a result, in the 21st century, this lineage becomes one of the largest and charismatic Tibetan Buddhist organizations in the world led by two young and talented 17th Karmapas, Ugyen Trinley and Thaye Dorje. Under their leadership, the religious organization has thousands of monasteries, nunneries, monastic institutes, and lay Buddhist Centres around the globe. 

Lastly, although being an expert in this lineage both academically and empirically, I admit that many answers here are not absolute but variable of time, place, and people. Also, I found that many questions asked here are anthropological and social science-based inquiries, in which the lineage may or may not necessarily have the answers.

562,Medieval Śrīvaiṣṇavism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Śrīvaiṣṇavism is a Hindu sect that worships Viṣṇu along with his consort Śrī, the main leader of which is Rāmānuja (traditional dates: 1017: 1137), a proponent of viśiṣtādvaita (‘qualified non-dualism’). This tradition is based on ubhaya-vedānta, i.e. both the Sanskrit and the Tamil scriptures. The latter consists essentially of the poetry of the Āḻvārs (Tamil bhakti poets [6th-9th centuries]), collectively known as the Nālāyira Tivviya Pirapantam (or Nālāyira Divya Prabandham), especially Nammāḻvār’s Tiruvāymoḻi, which is referred to as the drāviḍa-veda (‘Tamil Vedas’) or dramiḍopaniṣad (‘Tamil Upaniṣad’). Therefore, this sect, while not limited to Southern India, is much more present in that region than elsewhere. Around the 13th-15th centuries, differences of opinions began to rise with its important ācāryas (e.g. Piḷḷai Lokācārya [traditional dates: 1264-1327], Vedānta Deśika [traditional dates: 1268-1369] and Maṇavāḷa Māmuni [traditional dates: 1370-1445]) interpreting the scriptures differently on a few theological issues. This schism became cristallised a couple of centuries later (around the 18th-19th centuries), leading to the formation of two schools, the Northern (vaṭakalai) and the Southern (teṉkalai) ones. The former follows in the path shown by Vedānta Deśika.",1017,1445,480,572,Suganya Anandakichenin,2018-04-27 05:48:45.744 +0200,2018-05-03 08:45:15.752 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Gaddis are commonly called a tribe, although they have a complex history in being awarded Scheduled Tribe status in Kangra and ethnopolitical mobilizations are underway to include Dalits within the Gaddi tribal fold. The community is heterogeneous, spread across a large swath of the Western Himalayas extending into Kashmir. Primarily Shaivite, some low-status Gaddis have converted into a range of new spiritual beliefs.

564,Tribal Christianity (and allied castes) in the Himalayas,43,Religious Group (v6),"The tribal Christian population of the high Himalayas and low-lying hills spans five countries (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China) and contested boarderlands (Tibet, Sikkim, Aksai Chin and Kashmir, among others). It encompasses approximately 6 million people. The largest Christian tribal populations are 4.9 million converted Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics in Northeast India and 375,000 Evangelical Protestants in Nepal (a figure sometimes rounded up to 1 million) -- arguably the fastest-growing Christian population in the world. Small but important Christian tribal communities are in Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. The historical timeline of tribal conversion to Christianity depends on the region and date of missionary penetration into the hills. The Portuguese Jesuit João Cabral was arguably the first European to access the Himalayan region in 1627 with missionary designs. Since then, thousands of missionaries have come into the Himalayan region, from the London-based Church Missionary Society (Punjab region through the 20th century) to the recent explosion of South Korean missionaries populating language institutes and centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Indigenous house churches have sprouted up in remote tribal villages. Himalayan tribal Christianity falls into a broad spectrum of official affiliation. Some expressions of tribal Christianity are largely indigenous and invisible; they address local aspirations and offer respite from spiritual affliction and caste discrimination within circumscribed tribal cosmologies and social stratifications. Other expressions of tribal Christianity are hooked into international NGOs and global ideoscapes promoting salvation that are backed by foreign patronage and theological instruction; they are networked through social media platforms and employ a range of conversion techniques associated with Western (and South Korean) Evangelicalism. In some cases, tribal Christianity in the Himalayas allows discriminated-against Dalit groups who are embedded within tribal formations to find self-respect and social validation within the new idiom of salvation and equality under Yesu Masih (Jesus Christ). Although Christians are persecuted throughout South Asia, overt violence against the minority religion is not as strongly evident in the Himalayan tribal range as it is in Pakistan and non-Himalayan India states (especially Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where in 2007-08 in Kandhamal District 50 Christians were killed and 95 churches burned down). The rise of right-wing Hindutva politics since 2014 and the disproportionate criminalization of Christian conversion as coercive have pushed Christianity further into the social margins everywhere through India, including the Himalayan tribal belt. As would be expected, Christian tribals in the Himalayas are not strongly unified around their minority religious status; divided by language, geography and often theology and sectarian affiliation, they are sometimes balkanized into subdividing communities. Nevertheless, they are conceptually and anthropologically interconnected as a Pan-Himalayan community of faith, spiritual aspiration and unique forms of theological syncretism.",1950,2018,799,576,Stephen Christopher,2018-05-06 11:08:27.895 +0200,2018-06-15 18:00:32.382 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

567,Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association (GALVA-108),35,Religious Group (v5),"GALVA-108 (The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association) is an international nonprofit religious organization (incorporated in 2002) using hermeneutics and scriptural/historical interpretation of the Vedas and Vedic culture to argue for queer inclusivity within Gaudiya Vaishnavism and Hinduism in general. It is nonsectarian, has no official physical centers, and has been online for over 20 years. As an active community of queer Vaishnavas, GALVA-108 has about 4,000 worldwide followers and 200 currently active members. Western Europe and the West Coast of the USA are population centers. Although a cyber-organization, members are closely networked with each other and have had group meetings and shared pilgrimage not only in sacred places such as Vrindavan and Mayapura (sites associated with Lord Krishna) but also in their home countries (largely but not exclusively in North America, India and Europe). The organization was founded on May 8, 2001, by Amara Das Wilhelm, a direct disciple of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The founding intent was to counterbalance negative perceptions of queerness that were common within ISKCON (The International Society for Krishna Consciousness) and other Gaudiya Vaishnava groups. Amara Das published a research article about Vedic conceptions of non- normative gender and sexuality entitled “Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex.” After publication and setting up a website (currently hosted by Wix), several queer followers began joining the cyber-community and GALVA-108 quickly spread through Yahoo!, Temenos and Gaudiya Vaishnava websites such as CHAKRA, VNN and Harmonist. Ultimately, group discussion was moved to several specific Facebook pages. In 2004 the research article was published as the first chapter of a book, which has been updated periodically and an abridged version produced in 2010. Arguably the only book dedicated to queer acceptance from a Vaishnava perspective, it was preceded by several well-cited academic volumes covering similar terrain, such as Ruth Vanita’s and Saleem Kidwai’s 2001 “Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History.” The group is strongly devoted to the core teachings of Lord Caitanya as enunciated by the six Goswamis and shared by all Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Like all other Gaudiyas, they advocate sharing the sankirtana movement (congregational chanting of the Lord’s holy names) with everyone through the common means of public kirtana and the distribution of literature, books and prasada (sanctified food). In another sense, GALVA-108 stands apart by arguing for the centrality of LGBTQI+ people (often collectively called the ‘third gender’) in styles of deity worship and other temple-related practices. They focus on networking GALVA-108 members with other queer and third-gender communities worldwide and are theologically concerned with instilling God consciousness to queer followers, thereby ensuring not only virtuous living but also psychosocial wellbeing.

570,Supreme Master Ching Hai World Society,35,Religious Group (v5),"As Ching Hai initiates do not prefer to speak of their community as religious, it may be more precise to describe Suma Ching Hai as a transnational cybersect primarily composed of diasporic East and Southeast Asians. Suma Ching Hai is inseparable from a vast mediascape of online lectures, videos, chat groups, commercial enterprises and tightly-controlled official messaging. Sum Ching Hai is also a New Religious Movement that blends together aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and messianic theology. The charisma of the Supreme Leader Ching Hai, called Thanh Hải in Vietnamese, binds the community together. She is often revered by initiates as partly divine, as a perfected being who preaches the proper meditation style (Quan Yin Method) and spreads compassion and the uplift of spiritual consciousness. Born in Vietnam, raised in the West and now based in Taiwan, Ching Hai teaches a syncretistic theology. Based on her time in India, she incorporates Sant Mat traditions, Surat Shabd Yoga (emphasizing divine sound and light), and Radhasoami as practiced in Beas. There are many similar theological touch points: 2 1/2 hours of required daily meditation; spiritual progression through stages of consciousness; abilities to experience astral planes; and total devotion on the spiritual master as an aspect of divinity. Practitioners of Ching Hai are given initiation after watching and summarizing (in written essays) 90 lectures of Ching Hai (available online) and practicing vegetarianism for at least 3 months. They are initiated by either Ching Hai herself or, more likely, by about twenty disciples who are authorized to perform initiations. Children of initiates are given ""half initiation"" at 6 and ""full initiation"" at 12 based on their spiritual advancement. Practice of Ching Hai depends on region: in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam especially) and China, governments have branded Ching Hai as an ""evil cult"" and news stories abound about confiscations of illegal religious material or cult-like forms of psychological manipulation of initiates. In Vietnam, for example, Thanh Hải followers in Hanoi do so surreptitiously, with fear of government reprisal. Their meditation center is secret. Conversely, Thanh Hải  followers in Ho Chi Minh City are building an official meditation center and do not live under the same shroud of fearful secrecy. Besides official adherents, there are many people who practice Quan Yin Method privately and consume online material related to Ching Hai without identifying explicitly with a community or even community of faith. The global community of Ching Hai followers could be briefly summarized as bounded together by a range of theological beliefs, meditation practices and forms of digital consumption. Significant communities exist in Taiwan (called Qinghai Wushang Shijie Hui), where the main headquarters were established in 1986. Of Vietnamese origin, several thousand are practitioners and refer to Ching Hai affectionately as Chi Hai (""eldest sister"" in Vietnamese). Other concentrated populations of practitioners are in mainland China (although banned officially), South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and California. Based on five normative precepts -- which includes not taking life and eating a vegan diet -- non-initiates of a vegan persuasion may discover this NRM by visiting one of 160 or so Loving Hut restaurants -- from Prague to Hanoi to San Jose -- where they will be exposed to Ching Hai's spiritually-infused artwork on the walls and her teachings beaming through 24 hour satellite TV. A cursory glance through online and printed media highlights the importance of veganism and these restaurants in shaping the public perception of Ching Hai (which is sometimes branded a ""Vegan Cult"" in Vice, for example).",1986,2018,806,576,Stephen Christopher,2018-05-13 12:51:51.127 +0200,2018-06-09 20:42:06.672 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

581,Mentawai (Rereiket),35,Religious Group (v5),"This entry covers the people known as Sarereiket and who speak the Sarereiket dialect. Most live along the Rereiket River (Siberut Island, Mentawai Archipelago, Indonesia), residing primarily, as of 2017, in the communities of Matotonan, Buttui, Ugai, Madobak (Madobag), and Rokdok (Rogdog), as well as the developing settlements between those villages and the region of Attabai. Some Sarereiket people have also moved into the settlements surrounding Muara Siberut, especially Muntei. Sarereiket people are closely affiliated with the people of Saibi and Silaoinan, who speak near-identical dialects.

The Sarereiket Mentawai live both in settlement villages (barasi) and in traditional longhouses (uma) or other residences in the forest. Those living in settlement villages are more likely to attend regular services of religions like Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam, and they are more likely to enroll their children in school. Nevertheless, ""forest people"" and ""settlement people"" are not distinct groups: not only do families commonly keep residences both in the rainforest and in the settlement villages, but people who live in the forest typically have family members who live permanently in settlement villages. I thus treat them as a single religious group.",1970,2018,818,585,Manvir Singh,2018-06-04 21:28:35.559 +0200,2018-06-04 21:28:35.559 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Bang Chan was established in the 19th century, and is currently under the jurisdiction of Thailand's constitutional monarchy (an absolute monarchy until 1932).

588,Nyakyusa,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Nyakyusa are a group of Bantu-speaking people who inhabit the northern coastal plain of Lake Malawi and the section of the East African Rift Valley extending northward up the southern flank of Mount Rungwe. The Nyakyusa are linguistically and culturally similar to the Ngonde, who live on the northwestern coastal plain of Lake Malawi. After the establishment of European colonial regimes (ca. 1870s), the Ngonde became a part of the British Protectorate of Nyasaland (known as Malawi after independence), and the Nyakyusa were incorporated into the German colony of Tanganyika (Now Tanzania). After World War I, Tanganyika passed to the British, who assumed the territory under a League of Nations mandate and administered it until independence. (Kenny, 2011).  

The Nyakyusa religion is best characterized as a system of shared beliefs and ritual practices that are interwoven with Nyakyusa society at large. The major elements of their religion include ancestral spirits, mystical powers, and the presence of witchcraft. A sizeable Christian minority coexists in Nyakyusa society as a result of missionary influence; this entry focuses on the native beliefs shared among the majority of the population ca. 1930, before the more extensive incorporation of Christian ideas.",1905,1940,822,577,Emily Pitek,2018-06-11 16:22:04.180 +0200,2018-06-15 18:33:35.523 +0200,eHRAF

This entry focuses on the time of about 1930. At this point, missionaries had established contact with the Warrau, but the indigenous belief system had not been Christianized. The religious and cultural traditions of the Warrau varied regionally as a result of extreme geographic isolation, but shared a common belief in the god Jebu, the presence of their sanctuary (house of the Jebu), priests (guisidatu), prayers and offerings to Jebu, as well as religious celebrations and dances (Turrado and Muirden, 1945:302). The belief system of the Warrau is not an official or organized religion, but an aspect of life interwoven with society. Further, the Warrau did not place a strong emphasis on a belief in the afterlife, and did not possess rites, ceremonies, religious scripture or credo (Turrado and Muirden, 1945:302). As such, the Warrau religion is most accurately considered to be coterminous with society itself.

592,Veerashaivas,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Veerashaivas are devotees of Shiva, who emerged in in the 12th century, in regions that are now the modern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Veerashaiva path of devotion or bhakti was one that sought to remind its society that the mechanical performance of ritual would not help achieve 'arivu' or understanding. Arivu, led to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death. They also reminded the people around them that for moksha and for sadhana (striving towards it), all were equal, irrespective of class, caste and gender. Quite spontaneously, a number of people from different castes and communities followed this path of devotion and charted their self-transformation through a spontaneous verbalization of experience known as vachanas or simply, speech. Some describe the self-transormation in terms of six phases or Shatsthalas, which are Bhaktasthala, (2) Maheshsthala, (3) Prasadisthala, (4) Pranalingi Sthala, (5)
Sharanasthala and (6) Aiykasthala. 

Together, the Veerashaiva saints of the 12th century founded the Anubhava Mantapa, a forum for the discussion of experience, in the city of Kalyana, northern Karnataka. Anubhava literally means experience. Prominent figures of this mode of bhakti are Allama Prabhu, Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Soole Sankavva, Ayadakki Maramma, Devara Dasimayya and others. 

The vachanas explicate a yogic path and are essentially oral literature. The Veerashaivas are said to have emerged from earlier Shaivite sects such as the Kaalamukha and their tradition derives much from the Agamas. Many devotees of the Veerashaiva tradition took to expressing their devotion through madhura bhava (known specifically within the tradition as satipati bhava) or, love for the chosen deity and through surrender or sharanagati. The philosophy of surrender led to the Veerashaiva devotees to become known as 'shivasharanas.' For the Veerashaivas, Shiva is composed of Guru (teacher), Linga (abstract form of Shiva) and Jangama (guru with no attachments). The Veerashaivas believe in qualified monism or qualified non-dualism. 

Although the Veerashaivas expressed devotion in filial terms, their approach was largely renunciatory. They, however, did not quit society like other renunciants but instead stayed within and continued their duties. This continuation of the performance of labour but dedicating it from the beginning till end to the deity, Shiva, they considered as kayaka.",1200,2018,826,558,Sushumna Kannan,2018-06-21 14:08:43.705 +0200,2020-09-25 11:55:55.410 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

595,Western Samoans,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Samoan Archipelago is located in western Polynesia, which lies in the central Pacific. Together, the islands consist of about 3,000 square kilometers in land area.

Western Samoa—including 'Upolu, Manono, Apolima, and Savai'I—was a German colony from 1900-1914, then administered by New Zealand until becoming an independent state in 1962. The first permanent European missionaries arrived in Western Samoa in 1835 (LMS and Methodists), followed by Roman Catholic priests in 1845 (Bargatzky, 2009). Christianity gained rapid influence, and today, most Samoans are devout Christians of either the Protestant or Roman Catholic denominations. This entry focuses on the time before Christian influence (about 1825), when it was still possible for ethnographers to study the traditional religious beliefs. At this time, Western Samoans possessed a pantheon of supernatural beings and ancestor-spirits, as well as religious practitioners and leaders who held great social and political influence.

This entry focuses on the syncretic beliefs of the abangan Javanese. It is important to stress the variation and complexity of spiritual life in Java, as Java is ""not easily characterized under a single label or easily pictured in terms of a dominant theme.

Key features of the Nuxalk beliefs include a variety of supernatural beings, religious specialists (shamans) possessing supernatural powers, as well as rituals (most commonly dances) led by secret ceremonial societies called kisuit and siswak. This entry focuses on the Nuxalk ca. 1880, with emphasis placed on the central village of the lower Bella Coola river.",1860,1890,851,577,Emily Pitek,2018-09-25 21:29:28.037 +0200,2018-10-16 21:27:43.906 +0200,eHRAF

The Gilyak religion is animistic, and characterized by the belief that animals and the ecological elements (mountains, rivers, the sea) possess spirits, with each having their ""master"" god. Clans unite over shared religious festivals and mythology. Shamans are believed to possess supernatural abilities, and are important figures in the treatment of illness, as well as communication with supernatural beings.

Today, the Papago live on the Tohono O'odham Nation Reservation in Arizona, United States. This entry focuses on the reservation circa 1910, with emphasis on the Archie dialect division. By this time, the Papago have had contact with Spanish missionaries and settlers for about two centuries, and the United States had incorporated the territory into its reservations. As a result of this contact, Christian ideas have been incorporated into the Papago religion, which is a syncretic blend of native and Christian beliefs and practices.",1900,1935,853,577,Emily Pitek,2018-10-05 17:15:39.551 +0200,2018-10-16 21:21:02.112 +0200,eHRAF
621,Haitians,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the people living in the valley of Mirebalais, Haiti, ca. 1935. Albeit reflective of a typical rural, Haitian community, the following information pertains only to the people of Mirebalais and cannot be used to make generalizations about the Haitian population as a whole. More specifically, this entry describes the Vodun (Voodoo) religious group, to which the majority of the people adhere. Despite the importance of Vodun in many aspects of society, Vodun was not officially sanctioned at the time this entry focuses on, and thus the religious group is not considered to be coterminous with the society at large. Vodun consists of African traditions with Catholic influence; key features include the communication with gods through rituals containing dance and spirit possession, which are often led by religious specialists. Important supernatural figures are the Christian God, his son Jesus, saints of the Church, the Holy Ghost, as well as African deities called Ioa, mysteries, or saints.",1910,1935,854,577,Emily Pitek,2018-10-08 21:21:20.153 +0200,2018-10-10 19:37:38.118 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The Miskito ""developed as a result of European-African-Native American contact and admixture"" (Helms, 2011), which began in 1700. This mix of cultural traditions is reflected in their religious beliefs, which include traditional beliefs (such as those of spirits) influenced by Christianity. Christianity was readily adopted by the Miskito, so not much is known of their pre-colonial beliefs. Because religion is tied up with the society at large, this entry considers the Miskito religious group to be coterminous with the Miskito society.

623,Diasporic American Hinduism,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1893, Swami Vivekananda spoke at the Parliament of World Religions and espoused a monistic version of Hinduism which continues to be influential in the United States today. He was one of the first emissaries of Hinduism in America. In 1965, the Immigration and Naturalization Act allowed for increased immigration from all regions of India to the US. These immigrants were mostly skilled workers, particularly in areas related to technology and medicine. This ushered in an era of temple building. Also at this time, there were many  Indian gurus who began movements in the United States, gathering followers and espousing wisdom. These gurus brought yoga with them and what was originally a Hindu meditative practice often became separated from its origins in its American context. Finally, these immigrants started families and now there are many Hindu-Americans who were born and raised in the United States. Temples continued to grow as community centers in part to educate this new generation of Hindus. This is different from how Hindu temples function in India. 

Hindus in America are people of both Indian and non-Indian origin who practice Hinduism in its American diasporic context, where there is no overarching governing structure, but where ""Hinduism"" as a whole becomes more codified, regardless of regional or sectarian differences, in part due to its contrast with other religious groups. Hinduism in this context is often referred to as ecumenical.",1893,2020,1131,610,Rita Biagioli,2018-10-12 03:52:44.583 +0200,2020-08-15 04:38:20.514 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Many of the Roshaniyya believed Bayazid Ansari to have been a messianic figure (the mahdi), and they believed God to have delivered Bayazid Ansari a revelation known as ""The Best Explanation"" (Khayr al-Bayan). This text is one of the earliest—if not the earliest—examples of Pashto used as a language of writing. Some members of the Roshaniyya were initiated as disciples of Bayazid, but the term may also include those ""tribal"" communities in the Afghan highlands that temporarily allied with Bayazid Ansari in an armed resistance against the Mughal Empire.

""The people of the Canadian Arctic most often referred to as Copper Inuit had no name for themselves as a total group, but rather referred only to local groups"" (Damas, 1996). The Copper Inuit, at the time this entry focuses on, were nomadic and inhabited the coastal regions of the Coronation Gulf, ranging from Victoria Island in the north and the opposite shores in the south, to the Kent Peninsula in the east and Stapylton Bay in the west. The Copper Inuit did not have official political leadership; power was fluid among these nomadic people. Their religious beliefs centered around non-human and human spirits, as well as strongly held taboos related to the separation of land and sea. Shamans were mediators between the living and supernatural, and their powers were due to control over spirits. Shamans had limited secular influence. Because the religious beliefs were tied up with many aspects and functions of the society, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1890,1915,858,577,Emily Pitek,2018-10-15 22:05:34.378 +0200,2018-11-26 18:41:15.826 +0100,eHRAF

The piaiyen is a priestly figure who, through training and experience, is able to communicate with the supernatural as well as act as a medical practitioner. There is no official political leadership office, but local headmen are present and chosen on the basis of personality, power, and strength.

Although geographically the Tikopia are Melanesian, they are linguistically and culturally Polynesian (Firth and Beierle, 1995). The Tikopia are organized into four essentially autonomous clans, with each clan containing several lineages. The island is divided into two districts: Faea and Ravenga. Tikopian contact with Christianity began in 1858 with the arrival of the Melanesian Mission, which was part of the Church of England abroad. The mission did not have a major influence until 1923, when Ariki Tafua (chief) converted and the whole district of Faea followed, effectively converting half the island (Firth, 1970:308). This entry focuses on the district of Ravenga circa 1930, which at the time predominantly followed traditional pagan beliefs and practices. This polytheistic religion centered on the spirits of deceased humans (including those of ancestors, the recently deceased, and deceased chiefs), as well as non-human gods and non-personalized spirits. An elaborate ritual calendar dictated when ceremonies were to be held. The clan chief acted simultaneously as the priest, and was assisted by ritual elders.

With the Spanish invasion also came the arrival of Catholic missionaries, who have left a lasting influence on the Cayapa religion, which is now a syncretic blend of Christianity and animism.

The time frame for these religious practices begins in roughly the mid to late 6th century B.C.E. and ends in 409 B.C.E., when the city was sacked by the Carthaginians.

Due to the theistic nature of their beliefs and their status as a Vaiṣṇava school of theology, they also have distinctive beliefs that set them apart from other Brahmin communities, such as the belief in the doctrine of hierarchy of all beings, and the unique status given to the wind god Vāyu. Every member of the community is affiliated with a religious institution (maṭha), and each maṭha has a lineage of monks who contributed to the community through their philosophical and devotional writings.

Scholars have deduced that these texts, having similar ideas regarding the world, must have been written by an informal community of like-minded practitioners. It was therefore not an organized religion (though early and later organized Daoism does espouse some of the same basic principles). Because the state and provenance of these texts is unclear, little is known about the social organization of Classical Daoists.

Three Indian Tantric masters Śubhakarasiṃha (善無畏), Vajrabodhi (金剛智) and Amoghavajra (不空), brought the Esoteric Buddhist (later known in Japan as Zhenyan  真言, ""true word"", ""mantra"") tradition from 716 to 720 during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Tantra/Esoteric Buddhism that has spread in Tang China and was transmitted to Japan during the same period via two famous masters Kukai (空海) and Saicho (最澄). This tradition highly depended on mandalas, mantras, mudras, abhiṣekas, and deity yoga, containing magical rituals, spells, and other elements also seen in other Indian religions. Gradually this systematic tradition died out in China after the destruction of Buddhism during the Wuzong period (846). Later during the Song, more Esoteric Buddhist texts were brought to the Song court and translated, but their influence was incomparable to Tang tantric Buddhism. However, various elements and practices still existed in Chan and Pure Land Buddhism in China until today.

It is also contended that the Meo converted to Islam after leaving other Hindu caste groups and a tribe, Meena, with whom they shared several similarities or that they were a nomadic Islamic tribe called the Mids, or Meds, who migrated from Western India into the region now known as Mewat, between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Today, perceived as converts from Hinduism, the Meo, numbering around 20 lakh, are considered low caste, or Neech zat, by the Indian Muslims. The Meo men and women are disfavoured for marriage by the Indian Muslims because of their suspect religious identity and their low caste status within the Muslim hierarchy.

Till recently, they have considered themselves both as a caste group and a distinct religious faith within Islam because of this dual identity. During the colonial period, they were considered a distinct caste by both Hindus and Muslims. Their customs, traditions, life cycle ceremonies and modes of prayer, till the 1990s, closely replicated the Hindus with nominal adherence to Islamic practices like circumcision, nikah or marriage ceremony, and the burial. Though lauded for their syncretic culture and religious practises that adopted and adapted traditions from both religions without succumbing to the hard-core religiosity of either, they historically faced rejection from both the faiths because of their identification as neither a ‘true’ Muslim nor Hindu. 

Historically, the Meo inhabited a geographically contiguous space called Mewat or the ‘land of the Meo’, understood more as a cultural space than an administrative unit. In present-day India, it is administratively divided up between the districts of Nuh (formerly Mewat), Palwal, and Faridabad in southern Haryana and Alwar and Bharatpur and Dholpur districts in Rajasthan.

While Nataraja and his consort Sivakamasundari are found in shrines all across Tamil Nadu this is the only major temple where they, in the form of processional deities (utsava murti), are the central focus of worship. The temple is linked to other saiva temples. However, those temples are Saiva Siddhanta temples following the prescriptions of Saiva Siddhanta texts. The Natraja temple  differentiates itself as a Vedic temple with a ritual handbook composed by Patanjali, one of the revered saints of the temple. This variant means of worship, the atypical central deity and the temple's historical connection to ancient kings and devotional literature creates a particular type of Nataraja worshipper who is similar to but different from other Saivas.",700,2019,480,614,Jodi Shaw,2018-12-10 10:26:23.086 +0100,2019-04-22 07:44:40.312 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The Administration and Christian missionaries did not have influence over the Kapauku until 1956, which is after the time this entry covers. During the focal time, the Kapauku's religious beliefs centered around a creator deity known as Ugatame, who controls all events in this world. Ugatame is an otiose deity, but created other spirits who play a more active role in the daily lives of the Kapauku.

Religion played a minimal role in daily life, aside from occasional ceremonies and the pukimani system. The pukimani system is best described as a temporary state of being, during which certain behaviors are prescribed (for example, a woman is pukimani for a week or two after giving birth) (Hart and Piling, 1960:88).

Religious practitioners are either shamans (machis), who are generally benevolent, lead rituals, and practice medicine, or witches (kalkus), who are generally evil and are involved with malevolent spirits and practices. The most important religious ceremonies among the Mapuche are Ñillatun and Awn. Ñillatun is an agricultural rite for general protection and prosperity, and Awn are funeral rites, which are important for getting souls of the recently deceased to the afterlife.

The central religious activity was the Oracle at Delphi, also known as the ""Pythia"" after the primordial, mythical python slain by the god Apollo at the site to claim it for the Greek pantheon. The Pythia was both the high priestess of Apollo and his oracular mouthpiece, uttering authoritative but vague and often frenzied prophecies that made her the object of fascination across the ancient Mediterranean.

672,Qasr al-Bint,45,Religious Place (v1.1),"The Qasr al-Bint is a free-standing temple structure built at Petra by the Nabataeans, likely sometime around the first century BCE. The structure is one of the most prominent and centrally located at Petra, standing at the western end of the main colonnaded street and nearby to other notable buildings, such as the Great Temple. Even so, the Qasr al-Bint is structurally set apart from these other buildings, both in terms of its unique alignment as well as by a temenos enclosure and gate structure that separates it from the rest of Petra's city center. Within this sanctuary enclosure are other associated structures, most notably an altar directly across from the entrance to the Qasr al-Bint. This altar was dedicated to the principal Nabataean deity Dushara, and it has been proposed that the Qasr al-Bint itself was also dedicated to this deity (alternatives include Al-Uzza/Aphrodite). With the Roman annexation of the Nabataean kingdom in 106 CE, remodeling took place of much of Petra's principal monuments, including the Qasr al-Bint, and it is possible that the temple was rededicated to other deities at this time.

Little else is known about the use or functions of the Qasr al-Bint during the Nabataean and Roman periods. Given its prominent location and size, it likely functioned as one of the principal religious structures of Petra and the Nabataeans, but little else can be said about what kinds of rituals or activities took place at the temple, who participated in them, or how frequently they occurred. We do not even know what name the temple originally had. The modern Arabic name today is translated as ""the palace of (Pharaoh’s) daughter,"" in reference to local folklore.

In addition to the Ato Naeke and Nudam Naeke are other practitioners, such as the hunt-priest (Dehri), herbalist/medicine man, Bonga-doctor (Ojha), and witch detector (Jan guru) (Biswas, 1956:107). Religious practitioners (mainly the village priest) typically work with the village headmen. Because the Santal religious beliefs and practices are bound up with many aspects of society, this entry considers the Santal religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.

680,Gujarati Mata Worshipers,43,Religious Group (v6),"Gujarati Mata worshipers are devotees of various Matas or ""mother"" goddesses based in the state of Gujarat, India. Goddesses bearing the title Mata include Bahuchara, Khodiyar, Meladi, Hadkai, Jogani, Momai, and Hinglaj, among many, many others. Mata devotees have typically belonged to lower-caste and Dalit groups, though middle-caste groups such as Rajputs also hold Matas in high esteem as clan goddesses. Mata worship has traditionally taken place at small shrines in rural areas and villages, though Mata temples have recently grown in size and number in urban areas, particularly since the liberalization of India's economy in 1990. The number of Mata adherents is difficult to calculate, as individual religious affiliation is often plural in Gujarati Hinduism, though the figure is likely growing, as a gaining preference for a Brahmin-styled ritual repertoire at Mata sites has drawn in some upper-caste devotees.",1850,2019,677,651,Darry Dinnell,2019-05-21 23:21:05.227 +0200,2019-05-22 21:42:25.894 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

682,Lakher,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lakher, who refer to themselves as the Mara, “inhabit the south-eastern corner of the Lushai Hills district, south of the Haka sub-division of the Chin Hills, and the extreme north of the Arakan Hill Tracts” (Parry, 1932:1). This area is located primarily in the Indian state of Mizoram, but also extends into Burma and Bangladesh. The Lakher are comprised of six groups: the Tlongsai, Hawthai, Zeuhnang, Sabeu, Lialai, and Heima. These groups are further subdivided into clans, but the village (led by a chief or bei) is the primary social, political, and religious unit. This entry focuses around the time of 1930; just six years after the Lakhers came under British rule. At this time, Lakher customs remained largely unchanged by foreign influence (British government and Christian Missionaries), and traditional religious beliefs were still held by the majority of the Lakher population. The Lakher’s supreme high god is known as Khazangpa, who is believed to have created the world and holds control over all its inhabitants. Other supernatural beings include zang (tutelary deities/guardian spirits), leurahripas (demons/evil spirits), and ancestral spirits. No official religious practitioners are present; the heads of households perform most rites and sacrifices. Mediums (zhazanghneipa) have special communication with spirits, and typically use this communication for medicinal purposes (such as finding out what sacrifices to prescribe a woman hoping to increase her fertility, for example). Ceremonies are present, and accompany most major life-cycle events. Also present is a yearly cycle of rites/feasts associated primarily with agriculture and the propitiation of supernatural beings.  Zhazangpina is the most important sacrificial rite, which is performed by the head of a household in hopes of pleasing Zhazangpa, who will in turn bless the household with good health and prosperity. The Lakher’s religious beliefs are bound up with the functioning of society as a whole, so this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1905,1935,910,577,Emily Pitek,2019-06-25 18:03:44.221 +0200,2019-07-18 18:19:35.598 +0200,eHRAF

684,Huron,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is based upon ethnographic materials that reconstruct the Huron society prior to cultural changes as a result of outside influence. Reconstruction is made possible from accounts written by European traders and Jesuit missionaries during early contacts with the Huron. This entry focuses on the Bear (Attignawantan) and Cord (Attigneenongnahac) subtribes around the time of 1634, which were located between Lake Simcoe and the Georgian Bay in what is now Ontario, Canada. These two subtribes are the largest and oldest of the four Huron subtribes (the other two being the Tahontaenrat and Arendahronon). At the focal time of 1634, the village was the primary unit of daily life, encompassing social, economic, and religious importance. The village was led by a council of elders, a war chief, and a general chief. However, this varied by village and sometimes several chiefs were present. Leaders acted as a council, with no chief outranking others, and holding their position on the basis of ability, experience, success, courage, etc. Religion did not have its own distinct sphere in Huron society, rather, it was a part of all Huron beliefs and practices; “to them, their religion and way of life were one and the same” (Trigger, 1976:75). Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society. The Huron did not have religious specialists (e.g. a shaman or priest position), rather, chiefs often held ritual offices and duties in addition to their secular roles. The religion did not have a well-defined pantheon of supernatural beings, but the most important deity is the sky, serving as a present but otiose high god. Also present are previously human spirits, but these beings are not discussed in extensive ethnographic details. Non-human supernatural beings include Iouskeha and Aataentsic (two of the most important, best-personified, and most described beings), as well as  “… animate spirits [that] resided in the earth, the rivers, lakes, certain rocks, and the sky and had control over journeying, trading, war feasts, disease, and other matters"" (Tooker, 1964:80). Religious observances (e.g. taboos, superstitions) were associated with almost all aspects of Huron life, such as subsistence strategies and life cycle events. Four types of feasts were held, including singing (celebratory) feasts, thanksgiving feasts, curing feasts, and farewell feasts.",1615,1640,907,577,Emily Pitek,2019-07-07 20:45:13.534 +0200,2019-08-13 19:10:29.301 +0200,eHRAF
685,Badjau,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Badjau of Tawi-Tawi Island (also known as the Sama Dilaut) is a subculture of the larger Samal culture. The Badjau group is distinguished by their nomadic, boat-dwelling lifestyle, which consequently allowed for the preservation of their indigenous religious beliefs (which differ from the Islamic beliefs of the land-dwellers). This entry focuses specifically around the time of 1963, “when the traditional culture of these people was still intact” (Nimmo, 1990:4). At this time, Badjau religious beliefs were not distinguished from other aspects of life; this entry therefore considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large. Badjau supernatural beings include an otiose high god (Tuhan), non-human spirits (saitan), ancestral spirits (ummagged), vengeful ghosts (pangguah), and a variety of other ghouls/monsters. Religious practitioners known as djin (shamans) communicate with spirits, officiate rites of passage, and serve as ritual leaders. Magic is also present, and include the practices of anting-anting (the wearing of protective amulents), and kabolan (spells and formulas used to being about desired ends such as weather changes). The most important social unit of the Badjau is the nuclear family, which will occasionally come together at moorages to form family alliance units that cooperate for work activities and religious ceremonies. In addition to family alliances, the Badjau recognize about seven localized kin groups (comprised of related family alliance units that regularly moor together). Localized kin groups are led by a headman, and usually contain at least one djin. Social organization among the Badjau is fluid and constantly changing as families move from moorage to moorage.",1940,1966,908,577,Emily Pitek,2019-07-11 21:42:06.348 +0200,2019-10-30 19:45:24.709 +0100,eHRAF
686,Popoluca,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Popoluca are a group of people who live in eastern Veracruz and Oaxaca, Mexico. Linguistically, there are four groups of Popoluca: the Sierra, Texistepec, Oluta, and Sayula. This entry focuses on the Sierra Popoluca (the largest of the four groups) living specifically in the town and environs of Soteapan, Veracruz around the time of 1950. This region has a long history of cultural contact with outsiders beginning with the Spanish arrival in the sixteenth century. With the Spanish came Catholic missionaries, who built churches, preached, and converted natives. Consequently, the Popoluca are now nominally Catholic. However, Catholic ideas and practices (including the Christian God and rites such as baptism and marriage) have been blended with indigenous beliefs. Elements of former religion can be seen in the variety of supernatural beings as well as rites and ceremonies associated with agricultural and subsistence practices. Priests occasionally visit the area, but no full-time religious leaders are present otherwise. Magical practitioners known as nawats/nawals are present and practice malevolent magic--these individuals can be described as magical practitioners. Religion does not exist within its own distinct sphere of life, but rather pervades all aspects of Popoluca life; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Popoluca society.",1915,1945,909,577,Emily Pitek,2019-07-17 19:14:27.672 +0200,2019-10-30 18:49:24.721 +0100,eHRAF

689,Lengua,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lengua are native to the Paraguayan Chaco of South America. In 1889 the Church of England South American Missionary Society began to work in the Lengua’s native territory as missionary Barbrooke Grubb began a 20 year residence among the Lengua living by the Chaco bank of the Paraguay River. Although Grubb was not an anthropologist, his detailed field notes from this time have become the principal ethnographic authority on the Lengua. This entry focuses on the Lengua band in contact with the mission around the time of 1889. At this time, the Lengua were living in autonomous bands and villages with little social distinctions; chiefs only held rule when needed for the common good (such as in times of war). Magical-practitioners were present, with their main task to protect the village from supernatural evils. These practitioners could also affect the weather and foretell future events. The Lengua supernatural beings included a vague and otiose creator deity (symbolized by a beetle), kilyikhama (malignant spirits), aphangak (departed souls of men, who would stay around for about a month after death, then traveling to the afterlife), and departed souls of lower creations. Various feasts and religious celebrations were held throughout the year.

691,Fur,43,Religious Group (v6),"“Darfur, or Darfor, means the land of the Fors, who were once the owners and sole inhabitants of the whole province. They have, however, been driven back into the western part of the country, the remainder of which is now inhabited by various invaders…” (Felkin, 1885:205). This entry focuses on the Fur living in the Jebel Marra area of Darfur around the time of 1880. Although Darfur was taken by the Egyptians in the 1870’s, the province of Jebel Marra was not actually subjugated until 1881 when the last sultan (Haroun) was killed. Darfur later became a province of Sudan in the 1910’s. At the time this entry focuses on, Darfur was divided into five provinces (each ruled by an official), with each province subdivided into smaller districts led by local governors. A hereditary sultan oversaw Darfur as a whole. After centuries of cultural contact with Arab peoples and Islamic beliefs, the Fur are primarily Muslim, but elements of their original beliefs remain (such as agricultural festivals, and they have laws differing from those of the Koran). The Fur religious beliefs center on Molu, the one high god. Also present are spirits of the deceased, but these supernatural beings are not involved in daily life. Religious practitioners known as puggee’s had influence over the Sultan and chiefs, and were often more powerful than chiefs. Any male could become a puggee after training in reading, writing, and the Koran, as well as Fur law. Religion does not have its own distinctive sphere in Fur life; rather, it is bound up with the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society.",1870,1895,912,577,Emily Pitek,2019-07-29 17:25:19.417 +0200,2019-09-24 22:13:50.430 +0200,eHRAF
694,Eyak,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the Eyak living in the Copper River Delta, Alaska, around the time of 1890. The principal ethnographic source of information (Birket-Smith and De Laguna, 1938) reconstructs this focal time using informant testimony, written sources, and the account of American Colonel Abercrombie’s visit to the area in 1884. Reconstruction was necessary given that by the beginning of the 20th century, “…the 'civilizing' of the Eyak was practically complete, and they had almost ceased to exist as a separate tribal entity” (Birket-Smith and De Laguna, 1938:360-361). Consequently, limited information on the Eyak’s non-material culture was available, making a description of Eyak religious beliefs and practices somewhat limited. However, enough information is available to gather a general picture these religious beliefs and practices. Overall, the Eyak beliefs are animistic in nature, as “all animate and inanimate things have souls or spirit ‘owners’” (Birket-Smith and De Laguna, 1938:230). The spirits of deceased human beings are present, but not described in detail. There is indication that the sun was important and worshipped in earlier times. Also present are a variety of supernatural beings (often associated with natural elements or meteorological phenomenon), such as the somewhat mythic Thunderbird, or the spirit in control of the Copper River. Magic plays an important role in daily life, including taboos and superstitions around subsistence activities. Fasting served as a means of invoking the supernatural, or (in addition to sexual abstinence) promoting ritual purity. Witches and shaman are both present, and could be either male or female. Witches are differentiated as they only use their powers for evil. Shamans, on the other hand, possess high esteem; they serve as ritual leaders, medical/supernatural healers, and can enter trance states to foresee future events. Informants believe their powers are possibly inherited somehow, and note that their spirit helper(s) manifest(s) in dreams. Shamans are not equivalent to chiefs, but chiefs can command the services of shaman. Because religion does not exist in a distinct realm, but is rather bound up with the functioning of society at large, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1880,1910,915,577,Emily Pitek,2019-08-01 20:42:46.133 +0200,2019-08-08 20:12:12.238 +0200,eHRAF
710,Hidatsa,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Hidatsa are native to the North American Plains, and traditionally lived in semipermanent villages along the upper Missouri River and its tributaries in what is now northwestern North Dakota. Since 1868, the Hidatsa (along with the Mandan and Arikara) have lived on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. This entry focuses on Hidatsa society as it existed prior to the last major smallpox outbreak of 1837, which decimated the Hidatsa population and marked the beginning of more intensive and frequent contact with Europeans and Americans, and subsequent cultural change. This entry relies mainly on information collected by principal ethnographic authority Alfred W. Bowers, who completed fieldwork at Fort Berthold Reservation from 1932-1933. Bowers used the memories of older informants, archaeological data, and early records to reconstruct the period of time prior to 1837. Historically, the Hidatsa lived in three independent villages along the Knife River: Hidatsa-proper, Awatixa, and Awakawi. Each village was led by a council composed of chiefs and ceremonial and war leaders; top leadership positions were held by the owners of certain sacred ceremonial bundles specific to each village. The three villages had a tribal council (of about 10 members) charged with defense against common enemies and the general welfare of the villages. The Hidatsa did not have a clear distinction between secular and religious roles: ceremonial leaders held status equal with or greater than that of chiefs. Social organization centered around elaborate clan and age-grade systems. A clan was a named matrilineal group associated with its own traditions and mythology and was responsible for taking care of its members. Clans cut across villages, and were important aspects of social, economic, and ceremonial life. Additionally, “…the entire male and female population was arranged in a series of groupings based on age. For the greater part of the population, these groups were formally organized with names, symbols of membership, songs, and prescribed rites and rules of behavior” (Bowers, 1954:174). Both men and women had religious societies within the age-grade system, and men also had military societies. An individual’s clan and age-grade determined his or her position/role in the village, as well as social and ceremonial duties. The Hidatsa have an extensive and elaborate ceremonial system associated with various supernatural beings, natural phenomena, and agricultural and subsistence cycles. It is important to note that “at the base of all Hidatsa religious activities and concepts is the belief in individual and group-owned supernatural powers which are controlled according to long-standing rules” (Bowers, 1965:282). These supernatural powers are acquired from supernatural beings during vision experiences, and are associated with either tribal or personal sacred bundles. The owner of a sacred/ritual bundle also possesses the associated myth and ceremonial procedures. The owner thus leads the associated ceremony and is responsible for knowing where it lies in the ceremonial cycle (e.g. which ceremonies precede and follow). The ceremonial system is open to the occasional introduction of new bundle rites (the result of purchase or vision experiences).  Because Hidatsa religious beliefs and practices are interwoven throughout society as a whole, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Hidatsa society itself.",1816,1840,923,577,Emily Pitek,2019-08-26 21:33:02.338 +0200,2020-02-10 18:13:23.439 +0100,eHRAF
711,Kwoma,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kwoma inhabit the Peilungua Mountain Range, located northwest of the Sepik River in Papua New Guinea. The Kwoma are comprised of four autonomous sub-tribes: the Tangwishamp, the Urumbanj, the Koriasi, and the Hongwam; this entry focuses specifically on the Hongwam around the time of 1937. At this time, the Hongwam (hereafter referred to as Kwoma) had some contact with outsiders, including the Ambunti Police Post (and therefore the Australian government) which was located on the southeastern slope of Ambunti mountain. However, substantial culture change (including missionary influence) did not take place until after the time this entry focuses on. The Kwoma do not have an official political office; leadership positions are earned through age, knowledge, and ability. Also absent are official religious leaders; religious activities are performed by what ethnographers have named the Yam cult (because of the yam’s important connection with rituals and social groups). Membership in the highest section and possession of associated ritual knowledge is reserved exclusively for men who have gained importance in the community by having taken a head during a headhunting raid. Although the Kwoma do not have official political officials or religious leaders, the religious sphere of life is not differentiated from other aspects of life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.  A variety of supernatural beings are present, including ghosts and non-human supernatural beings (namely, those known as marsalai). Sorcery plays an important role in explaining sickness and death.",1912,1937,924,577,Emily Pitek,2019-09-05 18:36:33.611 +0200,2019-10-10 17:42:14.511 +0200,eHRAF
712,Huichol,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Huichol are native inhabitants of what are now the Mexican States of Jalisco, Nayarit, Zacatecas, and Durango. In 1722 the Huichol were conquered by the Spanish, after which Franciscan Missionaries arrived and nominally converted the Huichol to Christianity before leaving the area in the mid 1800’s (Lumholtz, 1973:22). Missionaries left a varying degree of Christian influence across Huichol communities, but at the time this entry focuses on (around 1890) native beliefs were still held and traditional customs and ceremonies were still practiced; the Huichol religion would become more syncretic with Christianity in the 20th century. To the Huichol, religion does not constitute a separate sphere of life; there is no distinction between sacred and everyday life. As such, this entry considers the Huichol religious group to be coterminous with the society itself. Religious practitioners known as shamans are trained in healing, divining, and priestly activities, and communicate with the supernatural. In addition to the spirits of the dead, the Huichol pantheon contains a variety of deities representing personified natural phenomenon such as fire, air, earth, and water. Fire (also known as Grandfather) is said to be the greatest and oldest, existing before the sun (Father). Fire is associated with deer and peyote. The Huichol “petition the deities for sun and rain for the crops, successful deer hunts, fertility, good health, and protection from the dangers of the natural and supernatural worlds” (Schaefer, 2016). The Huichol have an annual cycle of feasts and ceremonies associated with the propitiation of gods, and connected to the agricultural cycle and environmental phenomenon such as rain. Most importantly is the annual journey to sacred (known to the Huichol as híkul͂i), peyote land, where the plant is harvested and later utilized in rituals and to communicate with the gods.",1880,1934,925,577,Emily Pitek,2019-09-11 23:19:55.667 +0200,2019-10-03 21:18:46.018 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
713,Northern Saulteaux,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ojibwa are comprised of “numerous communities ranging mainly from southern and northwestern Ontario, northern Michigan and central Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Brown and Beierle, 2000).” The term “Ojibwa” describes a larger ethnic and linguistic group that is not politically unified. Historically, Ojibwa contact with Europeans began in the 1640’s with the arrival of fur traders and French Jesuit missionaries. The 1800’s brought an end to treaties and marked the Ojibwa relocations to reservations, occurring after the War of 1812 in the United States, and after the establishment of the Dominion Government in 1867 in Canada (Hallowell, 1955:117).  This entry focuses specifically on the Northern Saulteaux (around the time of 1930), an Ojibwa people who migrated to the more remote area east of Lake Winnipeg. In part, this migration helped the Northern Saulteaux to “conserve a great deal of their aboriginal culture during a period when armed conflicts with an expanding white population, the effects of the fur trade, and Christianization led to more rapid culture changes among the Ojibwa elsewhere (Hallowell, 1955:112).”  This entry primarily utilizes ethnographic information obtained by Alfred Irving Hallowell (the principal ethnographic authority), who completed field work among the Northern Saulteaux from 1930-1940. At this time, the Saulteaux had had contact with Christian missionaries, but native religious beliefs were still held. These native beliefs include several supernatural entities such as ancestral spirits and other non-human beings. Ethnographers have referred to Saulteaux religious practitioners as shamans, medicine men, or conjurers. These individuals had supernatural abilities (often acquired in a religious fast/dream state) including the ability to access knowledge from and communicate with people far away, foretell the future, communicate with supernatural beings and the dead, and solve mysteries. Additionally, these shamans had the power to abduct souls, causing sickness, mental distress, and death. Due to these supernatural abilities, as well as their knowledge and skill, shamans held effective leadership roles (despite the absence of an official political office and official religious leaders). Because religion does not exist in a distinct sphere, but rather pervades all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1910,1940,926,577,Emily Pitek,2019-09-26 17:31:56.004 +0200,2020-01-09 17:43:56.844 +0100,eHRAF

717,Igbo,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Igbo (spelled “Ibo” by British colonialists; Amadiume, 2003) live across Nigeria, and are united by shared linguistic and cultural traditions. There is no central political authority among the Igbo; the largest social unit is the village-group, bound together by ties but each village is functionally independent. In fact, there is “no individual of outstanding power or authority either directly in things spiritual or indirectly in things secular (Green, 1964:49).” Although there are not official religious leaders among the Igbo, there are two types of religious practitioners: priests and dibeas. Hereditary priests observe taboos and lead ceremonies, but are otherwise viewed as “ordinary” members of the community (Green, 1964:53). A dibea, on the other hand, undergoes training and initiation rites to become a specialist in the professions of diviner and/or doctor-magician. Various types of supernatural beings are present. There is belief in a supreme high god who is largely viewed as an otiose creator deity overseeing the world from above, and is not typically worshipped directly. Additionally present are the spirits of deceased humans, and ancestor worship appears to be the concern/responsibility of individual households and families. Several non-human spirits are also present, including village and village-group deities. Larger-scale rituals/ceremonies/celebrations are present, such as the annual rites surrounding the worship of the village-group deity. It is important to note the presence of Christian influence among the Igbo, beginning with the arrival of missionaries in the mid 1800’s. The religious realm of Igbo life is not distinct, but is bound in the functioning of the society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society.

719,Hinduism in Trinidad,43,Religious Group (v6),"Between the years 1838 and 1917, approximately half a million Indians were brought to the Caribbean through the indentured labor trade, a system developed after the British abolished slavery to provide cheap labor on sugar plantations.  144,000 of those laborers were brought to the twin island of Trinidad and Tobago.  On the plantations, Indians worked to maintain their cultural and religious traditions.  They soon united their community, using a remembered Hinduism as a platform upon which they could carve out a separate space for themselves within the larger society. They established temples, religious schools and organizations, and modified their religious practices to suit the conditions of the Caribbean island.",1845,2018,342,612,Prea Persaud,2019-10-04 00:59:25.745 +0200,2019-10-07 01:58:48.514 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
721,Semang,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Semang are native inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula. The Semang have little formal social organization or administrative units; the individual family is the primary social unit, followed by the local group (sub-tribe/group). These subgroups do not possess a higher level of jurisdictional hierarchy. “At least nine distinct cultural-linguistic subgroups still exist: Kensiu of eastern Kedah (near Baling) and southern Thailand (Yala Province); Kintak of northwestern Perak (near Gerik); Jahai of northestern Perak and northwestern Kelantan; Lanòh of northwestern Perak (near Gerik); Mendriq of central Kelantan; Batèk Dè' of southeastern Kelantan and northern Pahang; Batèk Nòng of central Pahang (near Jerantut); Mintil of north-central Pahang (near Cegar Perah); and Mos (or Chong) of the Pattalung-Trang area in southern peninsular Thailand” (Endicott and Abate, 2009). This entry focuses specifically on the Jahai (alt. sp. Jahay) around the time of 1925, and uses the terms Jahai and Semang interchangeably. The Semang do not possess a formal leadership office, either religious or secular. However, a religious specialist is present, and is called hala’. The hala’ has the special abilities of communicating with the supernatural realm, and serves as medicine-man. An individual becomes hala’ either through a dream, hereditary transmission, or taking possession of the Ćebu stone (which has ritual importance). The term Orang hidop refers to supernatural beings, and is best translated as “the immortals”. The orang hidop include spirits of the dead--who linger for several days but ultimately travel to the realm of the dead--as well as other, non-human beings. Of primary importance is the supreme high god Karei, god of thunder, followed by Ta Pen’n. Also present are Karei’s wife Manoij, their sons and daughter, Karei’s servants, and the Ćenoi (celestial spirit-beings closely related to the hala’). The Semang’s most important religious ritual is the blood sacrifice ceremony, during which individuals must draw and sacrifice their own blood in order to appease Karei either after breaking a taboo, or during thunderstorms to prevent further catastrophes. For the Semang, religious aspects of life are not differentiated from the secular. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1910,1940,929,577,Emily Pitek,2019-10-15 19:09:13.941 +0200,2020-01-09 16:43:45.393 +0100,eHRAF
722,Gros Ventre,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Gros Ventre are native to the plains of North America. The name “Gros Ventre” is a French interpretation of their sign language, and translates to “large belly”. This Algonkian-speaking, historically nomadic people refer to themselves as A’ani, meaning “white-Clay People”, and are also known by the Blackfoot name Atsina. In the late 1880’s the Gros Ventre, along with the Assiniboin, were relocated to Fort Belknap Reservation in northern Montana. This entry focuses around the time of 1835-1885, with tribal territory centering around the Milk River, and the Belknap Reservation representing a small portion of Gros Ventre held land. Principal ethnographic authorities use fieldwork, informant accounts, and primary documents to reconstruct Gros Ventre life prior to 1885, which marked the end of the buffalo era and the beginning of consistent missionary contact. The Gros Ventre were traditionally comprised of about 12 bands, each led by a respective chief who was distinguished in war and recognized as the band’s leader. Each band also had a Flat Pipe and a Feathered Pipe Keeper, both of whom served as religious leaders while also possessing political influence. The bands would periodically come together as a tribal unit, which was led by a tribal leader. Ceremonial organization cut across band organization, and most religious ceremonies were held at the tribal level. Gros Ventre political and religious life were interwoven, and this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large. Gros Ventre religious beliefs included a Supreme Being, who was considered to be the ultimate ruler and controller of all other supernatural beings, as well as the Earth and its inhabitants. The Supreme Being ranked highest in importance; he was always invoked first and received first offerings. Also present in the superntatural realm were ghosts and ancestral spirit helpers, as well as other non-human supernatural beings like Bha’a, the storm ruler or the thunderbird.",1835,1885,930,577,Emily Pitek,2019-10-21 18:13:25.094 +0200,2019-11-14 18:02:47.531 +0100,eHRAF
723,Trumai,43,Religious Group (v6),"“The Trumai are one of several indigenous peoples of central Brazil, living in small, ethnically based communities widely dispersed in a region that formed the headwaters of the Xingu River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon (Adem, 2010).” This entry is based on ethnographic information obtained by anthropologist Buell Quain during his 1938 stay at the Trumai village of Vanivani, along the Kuluene River. The Trumai population was already diminishing by the time of Quain’s visit; he recorded that the village contained four households and a total population of 43 individuals. The village was led by a chieftain who received varying levels of respect from the community. His primary responsibilities were to give daily speeches and coordinate communal projects. Two sub-chiefs were present, and had the sole function of taking office if the chieftain was away from the village. It was possible for a chief to also be a shaman, but at the time of Quain’s visit the chieftain was only able to employ the shamanistic art of curing, which was a skill most adult males could perform. A shaman is distinguished by having the special powers of locating enemy war parties and the ability to see the afterworld. Supernatural beings (ghosts and various non-human spirits) are present, and are the main characters of many Trumai legends/stories, but do not have direct causal efficacy in the earthly realm. Rain (Ka’wizu) was the only being mentioned to interact with the world, and was said to be the agent of rain and storms. A variety of ceremonies were also present during Quain’s visit, with the most important being the ole (manioc) ceremony, which is associated with crop fertility. Religion and the supernatural realm generally do not appear to be of major concern/importance in the daily lives of the Trumai, and many practices and ceremonies have been lost to memory. Murphy and Quain (1955:101) note that “in the case of the Trumai, disinterest in the religious sphere was closely related to disinterest in other aspects of their culture.” Just 10 years after Quain’s visit the Trumai population shrunk to 25, which is hypothesized to be the result of introduced diseases and low birth rate. Note that this entry considers the Trumai religious group to be coterminous with Trumai society.",1910,1940,931,577,Emily Pitek,2019-10-31 16:38:55.621 +0100,2019-11-01 21:53:04.686 +0100,eHRAF
724,Aweikoma,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Aweikoma traditionally inhabited a large area in what is now the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, and lived in small, exogamous patrilineal clans. These highly mobile bands were led by chiefs, whose authority was limited. In 1914 the Aweikoma were pacified by the Brazilian Government and relocated to Duque de Caxias Reservation (near Ibirama). This entry focuses on the Aweikoma living on the reservation around the time of 1932, when the principal ethnographic authority, anthropologist Jules Henry, began a two-year ethnographic study in the area. This entry primarily relies on Henry’s field work, which broadly covers Aweikoma life but provides somewhat limited information on the religious realm of life. Traditional Aweikoma religious beliefs and practices were able to be documented as the Brazilian government resisted attempts to establish missions (Henry, Benedict, and Kraus, 1941: xvi). These beliefs involve a variety of supernatural beings, including the spirits of deceased humans (referred to as ghost-souls or kuplêng), and monsters (Kuchágn Yunggí Wangdjó Yóin and Véin). The monsters, ghost-soul, and spirits of the natural world are collectively called nggïyúdn. According to Henry, shamans served as religious practitioners in former times, but no shamans were still living during the time of his visit. For the Aweikoma, religion does not exist within its own distinct sphere of life, but rather, is bound up with the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Aweikoma society as a whole.",1909,1934,932,577,Emily Pitek,2019-11-06 20:04:38.182 +0100,2019-11-08 21:30:27.798 +0100,eHRAF

727,Raglai,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Raglai are an ethnic minority religious community in Vietnam. In the 20th century, many Raglai converted to Christianity. This entry focuses on traditional Raglai Religion. They live in Lam Dong, Ninh Thuận, Binh Thuan , Ninh Thuan (57.442 people), and Khanh Hoa Provinces of the South Central Vietnam. Similar to the Cham, Churu, Rade and Jarai languages, Raglai is classified as a Chamic language in the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. The traditional life of the Raglai people is mostly concentrated in a small village (puk) or a village (palei) on high, flat land and near sources of fresh water. Each village usually consists of several dozen roofs/small houses. The members of Raglai family usually include a father, mother and unmarried children. A head of the village is called a “Po Palei,” usually the one who first developed the land or their descendent. Village chiefs are responsible for making offerings to heaven and earth during severe drought. The most prestigious person in the family are called “Ong Kei Palei” (village elders). The village elders run all activities, preside over festivals, and organize a teams to prevent wild beasts as well as invading forces.",1160,2017,935,664,Isvan Quang,2019-11-10 13:56:23.556 +0100,2020-01-19 02:04:17.828 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
728,Pentecost,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Pentecost (Sa) are those native to the area of what is now the southern part of Pentecost Island, Vanuatu, Melanesia. Note that in this entry, the term ""Pentecost"" refers to the southern Pentecost. For the Pentecost, contact with Europeans and the arrival of Missionaries began in the late eighteenth century. Despite the long presence of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Christ, not all Pentecost were converted to Christianity; at the time this entry focuses on, 130 of the 400 Pentecost people were non-Christian. Principal ethnographic authority, Robert B. Lane (1965:250), notes that “the non-Christian population consciously maintains a relatively unaltered aboriginal culture, albeit with reduced flourish owing to diminished population and to contact with Europeans.” Following Lane, this entry focuses on the remaining aboriginal culture, specifically in the village of Bunlap around the time of 1953. At this time, the Pentecost were horticulturalists, with patrilineages serving as the main social and political unit. High-ranking men (initiated males possessing greater age, experience, and magico-religious power) held both political decision-making power as well as ritual knowledge. Full-time religious practitioners were not present, but those with more magical (gurian) knowledge and power had the semi-professional status of ritualists and sorcerers. Mythology centers on culture heroes and sib (lineage) ancestors, as well as supernatural beings. Supernatural beings are present, but not described in substantial ethnographic details. They include spirit-beings of three types: armat en sanga (incorporeal beings capable of assuming human form), lipsipsip (malicious dwarf-creatures), and ghosts. Concerning ceremonies and rituals, the rites of lo sal are “one of the most important institutions of South Pentecost culture” (Lane, 1965:269-270). These rites consist of a man giving sacrifices of pigs, gifts, and/or payments to the members of his mother’s and wife’s sib. A man presents these gifts throughout his life, and the cycle continues with the birth of a son. Lane (1965:251) makes the important observation that ""the people of South Pentecost recognize no category of culture comparable to that which we label religion, nor do they have any institutions which are primarily religious. The phenomena dealt with here permeate much of the culture."" Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1928,1959,936,577,Emily Pitek,2019-11-13 16:40:49.394 +0100,2019-12-12 22:17:05.687 +0100,eHRAF
729,Kikuyu,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Gikuyu refer to themselves as the “Gikuyu” or “Agikuyu”; “Kikuyu” is their spoken language, and also the name used by British Colonial administration and anthropologists (Davison, 2010). The Gikuyu live in central Kenya in the administrative districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall (Murang’a), Nyeri, Embu, and Meru (as defined in the 1920’s). This entry focuses specifically on the Gikuyu living in the Fort Hall District of Kenya around the time of 1920. By this time, British colonialists held political control over the Gikuyu, and Christian missionaries had arrived in the area. Despite such contact, the Gikuyu culture and religious beliefs at the specific time and place this entry focuses on remains largely traditional. Gikuyu socio/political organization centers around three factors: the family group (mbari/nyomba), the clan (moherega), and an age-grading (riika) system that unites the whole society. The family, led by a patriarch, is the main social, economic, and religious unit. No full-time religious specialists (such as priests or shamans) are present. Rather, ""in religious ceremonies, and in political and social gatherings, the elders hold supreme authority"" (Kenyatta, 1953:263). Elders serve as intermediaries between Ngai (the high god) and ancestral spirits, and maintained communication with these beings (especially through the form of sacrificial ceremonies). The highest status for a Gikuyu man is the religious or sacrificial council (Kiama Kia Maturanguru), which is reached after passing through and being initiated into all age-grades. The religious and sacrificial council are considered “holy men” who are charged with leading all religious and ethical ceremonies. For the Gikuyu, religion is interwoven with all aspects of life; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1895,1930,937,577,Emily Pitek,2019-11-14 18:39:21.940 +0100,2020-03-10 16:19:41.792 +0100,eHRAF
732,Marquesans,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Marquesans are the native inhabitants of what are now the Marquesan Islands of French Polynesia. Six of the traditionally inhabited islands are Fatu Hiva, Tahu Ata, Hiva Oa, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, and Nuku Hiva. This entry focuses on the Te-i’i chiefdom of southwestern Nuku Hiva Island around the time of 1800, and uses the term “Marquesan” in reference to those living at this specific time and place. This entry relies predominantly on the work of Edward Handy (1923), who completed fieldwork from 1920-1921, and used accounts of early travelers and the memory of older informants to reconstruct the Marquesan culture as it existed in the past. At the time this entry focuses on, the Marquesans had contact with Europeans, however, contact with Christian missionaries did not begin until after this entry’s focal time; Christian missionaries did not start to have influence until about 1840. Consequently, this entry describes traditional Marquesan culture as it existed prior to changes as a result of outside influence. Traditionally, Marquesan society was comprised of many “chiefdoms”, each led by a chief who gained authority from the social prestige and power of heading a large, wealthy family and holding alliances with other powerful families. Although some ethnographers use the word “tribe” in reference to these social groups, the Marquesan’s political structure appears to be comprised of simple chiefdoms (see Thomas, 2011). These chiefdoms were not usually in clearly-defined territories, and had shifting alliances and competition, resulting in frequent warfare. In addition to a chief, each group had an inspirational priest (tau’a), who was also involved with political activity, and was just as influential as the civil chief. The tau’a was spoken of as etua (godly), and could enter a possession state to communicate with the tribal god (a deified ancestral priest or chief). The tau’a also had charge of caring for the dead, and presiding at tribal [chiefdom] ceremonials. Slightly lower in rank and importance was the ceremonial priest (tuhuna o’ono, tuhuka o’oko), who recited and led chants/rituals during religious ceremonies. The Marquesans had a variety of feasts and festivals, including those associated with harvest and subsistence-related activities, as well as the important events in a chief’s family (such as marriage, tattooing, and death). Religious performances held during these festivals included chants, dances, tapu, and sacrifices. The most important religious event was the memorial festival, which took place long after the death of a chief/chiefess, inspirational priest, or ceremonial priest, and was held for the deification of the deceased’s sprit. Marquesan gods (as categorized by Handy, 1923:224) include gods of myth and creation, departmental gods (gods of nature and the elements, occupations, sickness), tutelary deities (personal, family, and tribal ancestral spirits), and a class of demi-gods (legendary heroes and other characters). These categories are not rigid, and a god could belong to multiple categories. All gods of all classes are ultimately ancestral in nature. For the Marquesans, religion did not exist within a separate sphere of life. Religion was bound up with the functioning of society at large; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1800,1875,938,577,Emily Pitek,2019-11-20 20:40:50.050 +0100,2020-01-02 17:46:57.838 +0100,eHRAF
733,Kaska,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kaska are native to the Canadian regions of northwestern British Columbia, southern Yukon, and southwestern Northwest Territories. This entry focuses primarily on the Upper Liard Kaska (located northwest of Lower Post, British Columbia) around the time of 1900, predominantly using reconstructive ethnographic information collected by principal authority anthropologist John Honigmann during field expeditions in the 1940s. For the Kaska, continuous contact with Europeans began in the 1820s at the Hudson Bay Company post Fort Halkett, on Liard River. During this time, Protestant and Catholic missionaries visited the area, but did not start continuous work until the establishment of the mission at McDame Creek on the Dease River in 1926. Consequently, this entry focuses on Kaska beliefs and practices as they existed prior to major changes as a result of contact with foreigners. Traditional Kaska beliefs recognized a variety of supernatural beings, including spirits, souls of the departed, and monsters. However, these beings are not described in substantial detail, perhaps because, as Honigmann (1954:100) notes, “cosmological speculation remained unelaborated in aboriginal Kaska culture.” Kaska religious practitioners were known as shamans and specialized in curing, divination, and clairvoyance. Anyone could become a shaman and gain powers by successfully completing a vision quest, during which the individual would dream of animals and communicate with their spirits. Ethnographic materials reference religious ceremonies including the vision quest (undertaken by young men around the time of puberty), as well as summer dances and potlatches. The most important socio-political unit among the Kaska is the local band, which is typically comprised of the matrilocal extended family and led by the head of the family. The Upper Liard River Kaska were divided into two exogamous matrilineal moieties: the Wolf and the Crow. For the Kaska, religion is not a distinct sphere of life. It is interwoven throughout the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1870,1915,939,577,Emily Pitek,2019-12-04 18:10:24.269 +0100,2019-12-18 20:52:53.807 +0100,eHRAF
736,Jivaro,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Jivaro reside in the foothills of the Andes, around the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border. At the time this entry focuses on (1920) the Jivaro have had contact with outsiders for centuries but maintain political and cultural independence, while also resisting the conversion efforts of Catholic missionaries. The Jivaro live in dispersed, autonomous groups. These groups are not large, village communities, rather, they are comprised of a single extended family (led by a patriarch) that occupies a communal house. No formal, official political office is present. Older men and women who are knowledgeable, experienced, and possess magical power, are called whuéa and oháha, respectively. These individual lead ceremonies at feasts, but are not full-time religious practitioners or powerful leaders. Whuéa are the physicians of the community, using sorcery and divination to cure illness. The Jivaro religion is animistic in nature: almost everything possesses a spirit, and no distinction is made between human souls and the souls inhabiting plants, animals, inanimate objects, and environmental features. There is a concept of reincarnation, with the soul changing from one existence to another, but these beliefs are not linked to a formal system of thought or aspects of morality. The Jivaro have two words for describing spirits: wakáni (spirit of the deceased) and iguánchi (souls of people who were particularly feared or powerful during life, such as medicine-men and sorcerers). Also present are two deities known as Earth-mother Nungüi and her husband Shakaëma. These beings are considered the mother and father of the Jivaro, and are associated with crops and cultivation. The Jivaro religion does not exist within a distinct sphere of life. Rather, it is bound up with the function of society as a whole. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1895,1929,941,577,Emily Pitek,2019-12-09 18:11:55.783 +0100,2020-01-02 18:54:47.198 +0100,eHRAF
737,Nama Hottentot,43,Religious Group (v6),"“Hottentot” is the name that early European travelers (primarily the 17th century Dutch) gave to the indigenous herders of southern Africa, and “Nama” refers to a sub-division of the group. “Khoi” is the preferred name, and means “the real people”. The first European settlers arrived in the Khoi’s region of southern Africa (the Cape of Good Hope region) in the mid-17th century, and quickly displaced the Khoi to more remote, arid lands. In the 18th century, the Khoi population rapidly declined as a result of warfare, smallpox epidemics, intermarriage with other groups, and integration into settler society. This entry places a focus on the Gei//Khauan tribe around the time of 1860, and relies on ethnographic information that describes the remaining traditional beliefs/practices. The Khoi traditionally lived in tribal communities comprised of several patrilineal clans. One of these clans claimed seniority, and the chieftainship was hereditary within this senior clan. The tribal community was led by the chief and a council of older men. Together, the chief and the council served as the judicial council and controlled matters of communal importance such as feasts, sacrifices, and pasture land relocations. The Khoi’s pastoralist-based subsistence economy required that communities be mobile in order to provide enough food and water to their herds. Information on traditional Khoi religious beliefs and practices for the time this entry focuses on is limited as, “Khoi have been under missionary influence for a considerable length of time, and relatively little information regarding religious beliefs is available” (Boonzaier, 2010). Although not described in substantial ethnographic detail, supernatural beings are identified as being present. The most important of these beings include Haitsiaibena, a deified folk-hero, and ghosts of the dead (called /hei/nun, /hei khoin, sobo khoin, or //gaunagu). The /hei/nun do not appear to have been regularly invoked through organized family or tribal ancestor worship. Khoi rituals/ceremonies centered around life-cycle events and the transition from one status to another, emphasizing the times of birth, puberty, adulthood, marriage, and death. During these rituals the concept of !nau is important; !nau is a state of vulnerability/danger that the individual experiences, and is associated with social seclusion and some food taboos. Among the Khoi, a magician/diviner (!gai aob) is a respected and important person within the community. The !gai aob cures people who have been bewitched, and is possibly connected with some religious rites. Although the !gai aob is a respected and important person in the community, he does not appear to be a full-time specialist religious practitioner. For the Khoi, religion is interwoven throughout many aspects of society.

742,Thai Bhikkhunis,43,Religious Group (v6),"Thai Bhikkhunis are an elite network of monastics within the institution of Theravada Buddhism. The first Thai Bhikkhuni, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, ordained in Sri Lanka in 2003. Since then the Thai Bhikkhuni community has grown to about 100. There is a community in central Thailand, outside of Bangkok, led by Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, housed in a temple called Wat Songdhammakalyani. Another community, which is part of this network, is led by Bhikkhuni Nanthayani. Her centers are in the north, with Nirotharam located in Chom Tong, and Suttajit in Doi Saket, both within the province of Chiang Mai. The third branch of Nanthayani is international, with bhikkhunis speaking English from all over the world, located in Chiang Rai. The third group is in the South, Koh Yoh in Songkhla province, led by Bhikkhuni Dhammakamala. All of these network members have been ordained in Sri Lanka, and although they live in Thailand, are part of the Sri Lankan Buddhist community, or sangha. This is because full ordination as a Bhikkhuni is illegal both by the state and Buddhist religion in Thailand, since 1928.

744,Rwala Bedouin,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Rwala Bedouin are nomadic pastoralists who move throughout southeastern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia to sustain herds through the varying seasons. Traditionally, the Bedouin grazing territory extended north towards Damascus (as far as Homs), west bounded by Wādi Sirhān (an arid 200 mile-long depression along the border of Saudi Arabai and Jordan), east towards the Iraqi border (as far as Karbalā), and south towards Sakāka (bounded by the Nafūd desert).  More recently, “their relationship to land has been altered by the creation of nation-states in the 20th century and the establishment of national boundaries across their customary migration routes” (Young, 2009). This entry focuses on the Rwala Bedouin living in northern Saudi Arabia around the time of 1913. The Rwala Bedouin are Sunni Muslims, and believe in an omnipresent high god: In addition to Allâh are the inhabitants of the celestial world (malâjika) and the inhabitants of the spiritual earthly world (ˇginn), which were both created by Allâh. No full-time religious specialists are present. Individuals who are more knowledgeable or literate in Arabic might lead prayers, but each individual is ultimately responsible for their own religious practice.

748,Lamet,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lamet are native to the northwestern part of what is now known as Laos. This entry focuses on the Lamet living in this region around the time of 1940, and draws primarily from the work of principal ethnographic authority Karl Gustav Izikowitz. At the time Izikowitz was conducting field work among the Lamet (1936-1938), the region was governed by France, and was known as French Indochina. Despite being under French political rule, the Lamet culture was not greatly influenced by European culture. Each Lamet village is an independent unit, and no formal political office exists beyond the level of the village. However, the Lamet have seven totemic, patrilineal, exogamous clans that cut across villages and regulate marriage ties. The most important social unit is the house group, which is comprised of an extended family led by a housefather. Each village includes several house groups. There is somewhat of a hierarchy among the housefathers, with those who are lem (wealthiest) having greater influence within the village. The individual most closely resembling a chief is the xǝmiā (priest of sacrifice), whose authority varies in each village depending on personality and status. The xǝmiā’s responsibilities include performing all sacrifices to the various spirits of the village, ensuring order is kept and the spirits are not disturbed, and supervising the community house. The position is hereditary in the male line. Religious ceremonies focus around hunting, agriculture and the seasonal cycle, death/burial rites, and maintaining the good will of spirits to ensure the wellbeing of the village. Lamet supernatural beings include village spirits, ancestor spirits (also known as house spirits), and forest spirits. Additionally, rice possess a spirit in the same way that a human possesses a soul. Medicine men are also present, and use divination to determine which spirit is causing illness and what needs to be done to appease the spirit. For the Lamet, religion does not exist in a distinct sphere of life, but is bound up with the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society.",1915,1945,953,577,Emily Pitek,2020-01-16 17:17:32.218 +0100,2020-02-18 21:56:46.689 +0100,eHRAF
749,Korean shamanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Korean shamans are often denoted by the term mudang, which encompasses a variety of folk religion practitioners, and other kinds of spiritual consultants. While most Korean scholars, mass media, and public discourse apply mudang to both trance and non-trance practitioners, the terms mansin or kangsin-mu (god-descended mediators) more narrowly denote possessed practitioners. Sesŭp-mu are hereditary practitioners; they do not assert that gods descend into them and were not ordained after sinbyŏng (spirit possession sickness). This kind of initial possession serves as a demonstration that the practitioner was chosen by supernatural entities to be their mediators with people. The term mudang can be applied to both kinds of practitioners because before modern urbanization, regional traditions used to be the main factor that determined which kind of mudang will be common in each place. Although hereditary shamans are not possessed, they still engage with and talk to spirits. Sometimes, they harness the help of a spirit medium who can deliver messages from spirits and gods, although she cannot perform full kut rituals on her own. Furthermore, the dances and songs of this received cultural tradition are significant in terms of artistry because they are learned for many years, sometimes from a very young age. Their artistry has been acknowledged by the South Korean government designation program, as has been also the case with several possessed practitioners, or mansin. Mansin means “10,000 spirits” and refers to the polytheistic nature of this possession-based folk religion.",1800,2020,717,684,Liora Sarfati,2020-01-21 12:57:56.150 +0100,2020-02-05 19:33:42.407 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

752,Haroi,43,Religious Group (v6),"Contemporary Haroi traditional religion involves the practice polytheistic and animistic beliefs. The origins of the Haroi have been highly debated. One position argues that they were a distinct Bahnaric ethno-linguistic group from the Champā civilization (2nd – 19th centuries). Another argues they were a group of former Cham people that fled into the uplands after a war with Đại Việt (15th century) and then resettled into uplands, midlands, and eventually, some lowland areas. The second argument is more pervasive in Vietnamese language academia and within the contemporary H’roi community. Oral histories still circulate, tying the H’roi to the refugees of the royal court of Vijaya, the Champā polity that was conquered in 1471 CE by Đại Việt. The also state H’roi had to adopt practices from neighboring ethnic groups to blend in and not be pursued by Đại Việt militaries. Therefore, their spiritual activities became quite similar to the Bahnaric groups, while retaining some Chamic (Ede, Churu, etc.) beliefs. Their language is also classified as a Bahnaric language by recent studies in historical linguistics. Regardless of the origins hypothesis, their roots seem to be in the Champā civilization, followed by a period of becoming a distinct group (15th – 17th century), while assimilating into greater Bahnaric communities [perhaps “again,” likely “for the first time”] from the 15th – 20th century. 

Most English language scholarship considers the Haroi to be ""Bahnaric.""

This entry concerns Islam in the southern part of what is now Xinjiang, China in roughly the years specified. Until the mid 20th century, the region was locally called Altishahr, and religious practice was similar to that farther west in Central Asia.

759,Comanche,43,Religious Group (v6),"Historically, the Comanche inhabited the southern Great Plains region of what is now the United States, including southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and western Texas (Gelo and Abate, 2009). This area was restricted with the 1865 Treaty of the Little Arkansas, which bound many Comanche to the Texas panhandle area, and later the Medicine Lodge Creek Treaty of 1867, which outlined a joint Kiowa-Comanche-Apache reservation in Oklahoma. However, many Comanche did not reside on reservations until forced to by an army campaign in 1874-1875. This entry focuses on the Comanche around the time of 1870, reconstructing life prior to the reservation era and consequent culture change. At this time, the Comanche lived in autonomous, nomadic bands, following the seasonal movements of the buffalo—a key source of subsistence and materials necessary for life on the plains. “The Comanche band, or local group, ranged in size from a single family camping alone, through the small camp of related individuals who formed a composite extended family, up to the large band of several hundred persons” (Hoebel, 1940:11). Band size changed depending on the season, with larger bands functioning as a unit only in the summer months. Regardless of size, each band (or local group) had a permanent leader, typically an individual who possessed great importance and ability. When bands came together in the summer, the leaders formed a council and selected one individual as leader for the season with the others serving as an advisory council. Generally, the Comanche religion was not a formal, communal matter as “there was no religious organization, no theocracy, no priestly class, no dogma” (Wallace and Hoebel, 1952:155). However, religion remained an important aspect of Comanche life, and this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Comanche society. A high god known as the Great Spirit is described as an omniscient and omnipotent creator deity associated with the sun. The Great Spirit is generally otiose in nature, and acts through inferior spirits. The sun, Earth, and moon are also viewed as deities. Other supernatural beings include Thunderbird, spirits of the deceased, dwarf people, and guardian spirits. Vision quests are not mandatory, but most individuals participate. During a vision quest, individuals isolate themselves for several days, fasting and attempting to derive supernatural power (medicine) through “a mystic visitation, a dream phenomenon, or hallucinatory experience” (Wallace and Hoebel, 1952:155). In a successful vision quest, a guardian spirit will appear to an individual, often in the form of an animal, and transfer supernatural power. Although full-time religious practitioners are not present among the Comanche, individuals known as medicine men have acquired a large amount of supernatural powers (medicine), which can be used for curing, rainmaking, and divination.",1855,1880,964,577,Emily Pitek,2020-02-10 21:31:09.971 +0100,2020-02-18 21:32:01.027 +0100,eHRAF

Because of their harsh and isolated environment, in which agriculture was not possible, the Moriori developed a culture-based on hunting and gathering. Their society was egalitarian and peaceful, traits that are rare in most Polynesian cultures. Lethal violence was subject to a religious prohibition, and rarely or never occurred. In 1835 the Chatham Islands were conquered by Maori from mainland New Zealand.

764,Timbira (Canela),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Timbira are located in eastern South America and are comprised of about 15 tribes. This entry focuses on the Canela group living in Brazil (mainly in the state of Maranhão) around the time of 1915, prior to the reservation era beginning in the 1960’s. The name “Canela” includes the three adjacent but independent Timbira groups of Kénkateye, Apą'nyekra, and Rąmkō'kamekra. The term Canella was originally used by settlers, and translates to cinnamon or shinbone in Portuguese; “Canela” is the modern term. Traditionally, the Canela lived in a large, circular village plan with houses all facing a central plaza. These villages historically contained up to 1,500 individuals, but the introduction of diseases in the 1800 has dramatically reduced the population (Crooker and Beierle, 2012). At the time this entry focuses on, the largest Canela group (the Rąmkō'kamekra) was comprised of about 230 people. Canela social units include the individual family, matrilineal extended family, matrilineal exogamous moieties (each includes half of the village), nonexogamous rainy season moieties, plaza groups, plaza moieties, age classes, age-class moieties, and six men’s societies. Note that these groupings are all within the village level. The village is led by a chief (pa’hi) and a group of councilmen. Pa’hi have minimal political control and serve primarily as peacemaker and ceremonial leaders. Ceremonies are important, but not necessarily religious in nature and are largely associated with the social and economic importance surrounding puberty rites and the calendrical cycle. Religion and beliefs about the supernatural do not play a significant role in Canela daily life. Supernatural beings (such as the sun and moon) and ghosts are present, but not described in substantial ethnographic details. Religious practitioners, referred to as medicine men or shamans, consult with spirits to cure illness and sometimes gain a “disease substance” that can be used to afflict others. Religion does not exist within a distinct sphere of life for the Canela; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1900,1936,969,577,Emily Pitek,2020-02-20 22:23:30.701 +0100,2020-03-03 18:33:11.333 +0100,eHRAF
765,The Oneida Community,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Oneida Community was a 19th-century communal Christian Perfectionist utopian society founded and led by John Humphrey Noyes. Noyes, a radical socialist Christian preacher from Vermont, was expelled from Yale Divinity School and had his preaching license revoked for espousing Christian perfectionism. Noyes derived his understanding of Perfectionism from his revelation that the second advent of Christ had already occurred—albeit in spiritual form—in 70CE during the destruction of the Temple. This advent of Christ had ushered in a spiritual period during which perfection among men and the absence of sin, as a reflection of heaven, was possible.  Noyes first gathered followers in Putney, Vermont but was soon chased out of that area for his radical beliefs and practices and later shifted his society to Oneida, New York. Noyes’ principal community of followers was then established as The Oneida Community, but satellite locations in Brooklyn, New York and Wallingford, Connecticut were also founded. The Oneida Community was comprised of several hundred men, women and children who lived together in a large house called the Mansion House and were united socially and spiritually under Noyes' understanding of Bible Communism derived from interpretations of the New Testament and Noyes’ perfectionist beliefs. The Oneida Community understood themselves to be living in a new Christian era where the human institutions of law, marriage and gender relations were superseded by spiritual laws and interpretations. In this vein, the adult members of the Oneida Community practiced a form of non-monogamy they termed Complex Marriage in which each adult was considered married to one another as a large spiritual family. Gender relations and occupations were more liberal than in the surrounding Victorian culture of America at the time. Oneida Community women were notable for having short hair and wearing bloomers or loose pants during a time when women's fashion generally prescribed long hair and long dresses. Procreation in the Community was at first strictly controlled through their practice of “male continence” or coitus reservatus. Eventually, the Community engaged in a proto-eugenics experiment they called stirpiculture, which led to the planned conception, birth and communal rearing of 58 children. Community members engaged in communal labor, including agricultural work and community industries such as trap making. The Oneida Community eventually dissolved as a religious community due to internal disputes and was re-imagined as a secular joint-stock company most famous for its dish ware.",1848,1881,970,691,Alexandra Prince,2020-02-24 22:39:57.108 +0100,2020-08-10 23:32:56.438 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This entry focuses on the native belief system of those living in the village and environs of Rengsanggri around the time of 1955. At this time, the village of Rengsanggri contained sixty households (about 300 individuals), making it one of the largest Garo villages. Every Garo is a member of one of five exogamous matrilineal descent groups, which are each divided into numerous subdivisions (Burling, 1963). The household is the primary unit of production, consumption, and daily life.

794,Omaha,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the Omaha living in what is now Northeastern Nebraska, around the time of 1860, prior to significant American influence, Christianization efforts, and subjection to the law of the United States. This entry relies primarily on the principal ethnographic authority (Fletcher and La Flesche, 1911), which provides a reconstruction of Omaha life prior to significant cultural changes. As Fletcher and La Flesche (1911) state, “tribal organization of the Omaha was based on certain fundamental religious ideas, cosmic in significance; these had reference to conceptions as to how the visible universe came into being and how it is maintained” (p.134). The prominent religious idea that the authors refer to is Wakónda, which is the invisible and continuous life force that pervades all things both seen and unseen. Wakónda manifests itself in duality: of motion and permanency, of male and female. It is the sense of oneness of the universe. Wakónda is relevant to all aspects of Omaha life, from social and political structure to religious beliefs and practices. Representing the duality of Wakónda, the Omaha were organized into two grand divisions: Inshtacunda, representing the Sky People, and Hongashenu, representing the Earth People. Within each division were five gentes; each gens was an exogamous kin group with distinct rites, tabu, and symbolic characteristics. Each of the two grand divisions had a principal chief; these two chiefs, together with five other chiefs from across the grand divisions, comprised the Council of Seven. The Council of Seven was tasked with the political leadership of the Omaha and duties such as the maintenance of order and decision-making responsibility. Chiefs were favored by Wakónda; chiefs had a special relationship and connection to its unseen powers. In every gens, a particular family held the hereditary right to fill the position of keeper or “priest” who was charged with the gens’ sacred object and associated rites and rituals. As religious leader, the keeper was responsible for conducting ceremonies and rites for his gens. All ceremonies were connected to Wakónda, including both individual and communal practices. Because religious beliefs permeate almost all aspects of Omaha life, this entry considers the Omaha religious group to be coterminous with Omaha society itself.",1840,1880,986,577,Emily Pitek,2020-04-20 22:07:28.197 +0200,2021-09-18 18:35:01.829 +0200,eHRAF

826,"The Church of Christ, Scientist",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as Christian Science, is an American Christian restorationist religion and healing tradition founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879. Christian Science is predicated on what’s considered Eddy’s re-discovery of the divine healing ministry of Jesus Christ as an essential aspect of Christian life. After a lifetime of physical and mental suffering, Eddy founded Christian Science following a debilitating fall on the ice in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1866 referred to as the “Fall in Lynn”. During her period of recovery, she turned to the Bible for relief and later wrote her understanding of Jesus’ ministry in a text published in 1875 entitled Science and Health (later re-published as Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures). Eddy underscored the need for Christians to take part in healing both themselves and others and declared that the same works of healing demonstrated by Jesus were not miracles particular to his age but available to all Christians. Before writing Science and Health, Eddy was a student of New Thought leader Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. 

During the turn of the 20th century, Christian Science rapidly attracted followers across the United States and later in Europe and Australia. Eventually the religion would spread to Asia and Africa, where it now has experienced its greatest growth. The religious practice of Christian Science is based on study of the King James version of the Bible and a large corpus of writings authored by Mary Baker Eddy, especially her work Science and Health which is considered the textbook of Christian Science. 

In lieu of clergy, Christian Scientists instead view the Bible and Science and Health as their only “Pastor.” They are most well-known for engaging in healing by prayer rather than seeking allopathic medical care, although they are not forbidden as members of the Church from seeking medical attention. Christian Scientists employ prayer for healing and also hire professional healers in Christian Science known as practitioners. Christian Scientists are called to engage in the healing work of Jesus Christ by healing themselves and others through prayer alone. This prayer involves an understanding of God as Perfect Spirit and man as God’s perfect creation. Reality is interpreted as strictly metaphysical or Divine Spirit, and consequently, disease and matter are dismissed as unreal and lacking in “intelligence” and power. Christian Scientists interpret disease as the product of fear or erroneous thinking referred to as “mortal mind” and dismiss epidemiological interpretations of illness and contagion.

In the United States, members of the Church of Christ, Scientist have historically labored through lobbying and other means of political redress to maintain what they consider their religious freedom to opt for care under a Christian Science practitioner or healer rather than seeking medical attention. Christian Science has therefore been influential in shaping the United States’ legal interpretation of religious freedom. Christian Scientists have been implicated in charges of child neglect and abuse in legal cases in which Christian Science parents opted to heal their children through prayer rather than seeking medical attention. Highly-publicized cases of this nature in the late 20th century brought significant negative attention to Christian Science.

The Christian Science church is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and is known as the Mother Church. It is also the home of the Christian Science Publishing Society where the Christian Science Monitor, an internationally-recognized periodical, is published. The Church also publishes the Christian Science Journal and the Christian Science Sentinel. Both publications contain public testimonies of Christian Science healing. Christian Science churches hold two services each week, one on Sunday and another on Wednesday. Each is led by two readers, or appointed members of branch churches who read from both the King James Bible and Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. The Wednesday service includes public testimony of healings. In addition to Christian Science branch churches, Christian Science Reading Rooms are operated in conjunction with each church as a “public face” to the religion and offer a place where members and non-members can access and purchase Christian Science literature. Reading Rooms are operated by Christian Science branch church volunteers. 

Christian Science is considered a “science” or “divine science” in that the religion’s efficacy regarding healing is understood as demonstrable and repeatable. Christian Scientists additionally understand their faith as adhering to divine laws that supersede natural laws. When Eddy adopted the term science in the late 19th century, the term was in wider circulation and had broader connotations than today.",1866,2020,1940,691,Alexandra Prince,2020-06-23 19:24:58.611 +0200,2023-04-23 04:55:43.993 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

839,"19th century German Protestantism",43,Religious Group (v6),"German Protestantism of the 18th and 19th century, mainly in the Lutheran tradition, was a crucible for widely disseminated theology that continues to influence contemporary Christianity. This period was entrenched within the Enlightenment, and very consciously so. The efforts to systematize theological views and biblical interpretation within the new paradigms of scientific progress and Rationalism greatly influenced both institutional and personal piety in this period. The birth of biblical studies within academic institutions was also developed in this period. Particularly, scholars of theology began applying socio-historical criticism to the Bible in ways that drove the theological debates among the elites. As in many societies, elite discourse did not necessarily affect the day-to-day of practitioners immediately, but many of the developments within the academy did find themselves disseminated broadly, particularly as culminated in the popular works of Adolf Harnack at the end of the 19th century.
For most practitioners, their attentions would have been less on the academic debates and more on their immediate socio-political environment. Germany in the 19th century saw many revolutions, such as that of Napoleon Bonaparte, the end of constitutional monarchy of 1919, the revolutions of 1848-1849 (Märzrevolution), the rise of the German Empire, and the industrial revolution, the latter making Germany one of the most powerful nations in Europe. The population grew greatly in this new democracy, creating new opportunities and challenges in itself. Thinkers like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) and Karl Marx (1818-1883) greatly influenced the political landscape and fueled ideologies of revolution.
The relationship between the Church and the State also changed greatly in this period. Frederick William III endeavored to unify the Protestant Church. Lutherans, Calivinists, and Reformed congregations made moves to merge their parrishes. Some, particularly the “Old Lutherans,” rejected such moves and emigrated elsewhere to avoid possible sanctions. The United States and Australia were popular destinations for these Lutherans, where they established the “Missouri Synod” and the Lutheran Church of Australia, respectively.
While many people surely went about their lives without notice of the paradigm shifts Germany was experiencing, the net effect of these changes shook the world on the economic, religious, and social levels. A full understanding of Protestant religion today and the formative events of the 20th century on European and American culture (particularly the World Wars), benefits from a comprehension of the 19th century Protestant developments which fed directly into the creation of modernity.",1788,1914,1008,722,Ryan Fitzgerald,2020-07-16 11:01:59.669 +0200,2020-08-15 22:51:29.429 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
841,Sa skya,43,Religious Group (v6),"In order to classify Tibetan Buddhism, genuine classification principles have to be applied, e.g. according to the monasteries in which certain schools of Tibetan Buddhism were established, or on the basis of the name of the master to whom a particular school of Tibetan Buddhism is attributed, or according to the preferred spiritual and cultural background of a particular master.

The school is named after the Sakya Buddhist monastery founded in 1073 by Khön Könchog Gyelpo (1034-1102), which is located in Sakya and was called Sakya Densa (sa skya gdan sa) or Sakya Gönpa (sa skya dgon pa) in Tibet.

842,American Evangelicalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"American Evangelicalism is a subset of American Christianity that spans numerous denominational groups including Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Pentecostals among others. A theologically diverse movement, American Evangelicals are often recognized for their emphasis on revivalism and personal religious conversion. The movement lacks a centralized institutional leader, but diverse local, regional, and national networks help reinforce religious authority. 

American Evangelical beginnings can be traced back to the early eighteenth century when a series of religious revivals took place in colonial New England. Preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield along with lay leaders like Sarah Osborn preached a version of Christianity that prioritized a personal conversion experience in which individuals became assured of their salvation. By privileging an individual experience, evangelical adherents gained the power to proclaim their faith in God giving some scholars the impression that the movement “democratized” Christianity. While individuals may have gained some authority through this emphasis on a personal religious experience, an individual’s community functioned to help evaluate and verify whether experiences were genuine. 

Revivals and worship services that seek to encourage a conversion experience have been hallmarks of the American Evangelical movement. These large events include singing hymns and preaching and could take place either in a church or outside as with the Cane Ridge Reveal of 1801. Individuals like Dwight Moody, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson carried this revivalistic tradition into the twentieth century. Today, large Mega Churches like Saddleback Church in California effectively turn Sunday worship services into large revivalistic events. Not all American Evangelical churches are large, however, and many have no more than a couple hundred members.

American Evangelicals are incredibly effective institution builders, utilizing technological innovation, print culture, higher education, and marketing tactics to attract new members as well as shape and reinforce their identity. From organizations like the American Tract Society to evangelical Colleges and Universities, American Evangelicals have been successful through constructing institutions and accruing wealth as a result of these institutions. 

Coupled with their institution building, American Evangelicals are also politically active. In the nineteenth century this political activism took the form of moral reform societies, and by the twentieth century, evangelical political activism became more intensely wedded to partisan politics. In 1976, the magazine Newsweek declared it the “Year of the Evangelical” spurred in large part to the election of President Jimmy Carter, a self described “Born Again,” evangelical Christian. American Evangelicals continued to exercise significant political influence in American political life well into the twenty-first century, and overwhelmingly supported the election of Donald Trump in 2016.",1730,2020,1011,728,Andrew Gardner,2020-07-16 18:25:05.960 +0200,2020-08-21 16:57:02.510 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
843,Bnay Qyāmā and Bnāt Qyāmā,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Bnay Qyāmā and Bnāt Qyāmā (""Sons of the Covenant"" and ""Daughters of the Covenant"" respectively) were Syriac Christian ascetics first attested in the fourth century CE. These individuals, sworn to an ascetic and celibate life, served public and liturgical functions within Syriac churches and communities. Evidence of their activities survives in remarks in a variety of religious treatises and hagiographical texts as well as rules promulgated by religious leaders. This article summarizes the known origins, social significance, and ecclesiastical functions of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā.


The precise social and linguistic origins of the designation are debated. The noun often translated “covenant” (qyāmā) derives from the root qwm (“to stand”), and it has a wide range of meanings, including status, station, oath, and contract. Robert Murray has suggested an origin for the term in baptismal rites, where the catechumen took a proverbial “stand” and rose from the waters (Murray 1974/5). According to another view, the related noun for “resurrection” (qyāmtā) may have played a role in this use of bnay qyāmā (cf. Luke 20:36). Finally, M.R. Macina has argued that the term related to Greek kanon and tentatively proposed that the bnay qyāmā – “members of the [church] institution” – were more integrated into the clerical hierarchy (Macina 1999).


If we are to believe fourth and fifth-century martyr narratives which claim that children of the covenant were targeted in the persecutions of Diocletian and Shapur II, “covenanters” probably existed as pre-monastic ascetic movement in the third century (Harvey 2005, 126). The most important early source is Aphrahat’s sixth demonstration which dates to around 336/7 and describes the renunciatory ideal of the bnay qyāmā. His text, replete with military and athletic imagery, exhorts the children of the covenant to reject the refinements and attachments of the world and instead embrace a spiritual marriage with Christ.


Aside from passing references to the group in hagiographies and church histories, most of our knowledge of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā derives from lists of canons, most notably the rules attributed to Rabbula, bishop of Edessa in 411-32 (see Phenix and Horn 2017), but also in canons attributed to Maruta of Maipherqat in the fifth-century and John of Tella in the sixth-century (see Vööbus 1975 and 1982). These rules prescribe communal and celibate living, either with ones family or with fellow children of the covenant (of the same sex). It can be inferred that vows of poverty were not required based on their prohibition from usury and exemption from collections from priests. Clothing was to be uniform and modest, and outside business and legal entanglements were not allowed. Prayer and fasting were their primary responsibilities, but they also cared for church administration, the staffing of hospitals, and the care of the poor.


One feature of the “covenanters” which distinguishes them from later monastic communities in the west was their central role in public liturgical singing. The bnāt qyāmā were particularly unique in this regard (on which, see Harvey 2005). The fifteenth canon of the synod of Phrygian Laodicea restricted singing in church to these women. According to Jacob of Sarug, Ephrem the Syrian (late 4th c.) established a choir of women to sing his hymns. In this role, they embodied and taught the eschatological and soteriological ideals of the wider religious community. 


By the medieval period the bnay/bnāt qyāmā had declined in importance. On the one hand, the bnāt qyāmā became assimilated with deaconesses and nuns. On the other hand, bnay qyāmā were eclipsed by both clerics within the ecclesiastic hierarchy and cenobitic monks. Aside from a smattering of literary references, the bnay/bnāt qyāmā had largely disappeared by the tenth century.

The geographic extent of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā was much broader than the region marked here, namely the Roman province of Osroene in the fifth century, which was chosen both for the sake of simplicity and due to the importance of Edessa as a cultural and religious center. Syriac Christianity and the institution of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā certainly extended into other provinces of the Roman empire and the Persian empire to the east.",300,900,1012,724,Jonathan Warner,2020-07-16 19:20:53.242 +0200,2020-08-15 19:03:19.860 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
845,Sо̄tо̄ Mission of San Francisco—Sо̄kо̄ji,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sо̄kо̄ji (桑港寺) is a Sōtō Zen Buddhist temple located in San Francisco's Japantown. Founded on 8 December 1934 by Reverend Isobe Hо̄sen (磯部峰仙), Sо̄kо̄ji is arguably one of the most historically significant Zen Buddhist institutions in the United States. In addition to serving the religious and cultural needs of the Japanese American community in the Bay Area for over 85 years, Sо̄kо̄ji is the point of origin for many Sōtō Zen lineages in the U.S. The temple’s original location, a former synagogue at 1881 Bush Street, was purchased in 1934 by Teruo Kasuga. Over the next two decades, Sо̄kо̄ji’s Japanese American congregation survived incarceration during World War II—at which time they continued to make payments on the temple building—and anti-Japanese racism post-war. In 1959, Suzuki Shunryū (鈴木俊隆) was appointed Sо̄kо̄ji’s sixth head priest. After gathering a large following of predominantly white and non-Japanese disciples, Suzuki resigned from his position in 1969 and founded the San Francisco Zen Center (Hosshinji 発心寺) and Tassajara Zen Mountain Center (Zenshinji 禅心寺). Many of Suzuki’s students have become Zen teachers in their own right, such as Reb Anderson, Jakusho Kwong, and Mel Weitsman. Sо̄kо̄ji has also been home to several associate priests (所属僧侶) who went on to train students of their own or become important voices for Zen in the U.S., including Katō Wako (加滕和光), Chino Kōbun (知野弘文), and Katagiri Dainin (片桐大忍). Katagiri in particular, who was assigned to assist Suzuki in the 1960s, founded the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center (Ganshōji 願生寺) in 1972 and was key propagating Sōtō Zen Buddhism in the American Midwest. In 1980, construction began on a new building for Sо̄kо̄ji at 1691 Laguna Street, which was completed in 1984 and has been its home since. Sо̄kо̄ji continues to be a valued institution in the Japantown community. It offers private services (weddings, funerals, memorials, etc.), monthly services, and annual services such as the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes (higan 彼岸), Hanamatsuri (花祭り), and Obon (お盆). Sо̄kо̄ji also hosts a martial arts school, sutra-copying classes, tea ceremony courses, and is an avid participant in Japantown’s annual Cherry Blossom Festival. Finally, Sо̄kо̄ji has an active zazenkai (座禅会) or zazen meditation group that meets several times a week and holds occasional multi-day practice intensives (sesshin 接心).",1934,2020,1014,593,Jake Nagasawa,2020-07-17 16:24:57.862 +0200,2020-09-01 18:08:36.317 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
846,Xuanzang's Yogācāra Tradition,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is aimed to document the religious beliefs and activities of Xuanzang and his major dharma heirs. Xuanzang (intentionally or subconsciously) established the ""Yogācāra"" tradition, which he deemed as the genuine form of Mahāyāna Buddhism, in China. 

Xuanzang is one of the most famous pilgrims in world history who took an arduous journey to India, studied at the Nalanda Monastery, and introduced thousands of Buddhist scriptures to China. After returning from India, Xuanzang accompanied the Emperor Taizong of Tang for a period of time. Later, with the royal patronage, he initiated mass translation projects and thus also renowned as one of the “Four Greatest Chinese Buddhist translators.”

Within his translation teams, a few members became his intimate disciples, e.g. Kuiji, Woncheuk and Puguang. They carried and developed Xuanzang’s teaching and wrote many commentaries to explain this sophisticated scholastic Buddhist tradition. As a request received from Kuiji, Xuanzang, based on the works of the ten greatest Yogācāra commentators at the Nalanda Monastery, manufactured the classic compendium Cheng weishi lun, which later became the most seminal text not only for the whole Yogācāra tradition but also for the whole Chinese Buddhism tradition. 

Despite its particularity, this tradition is far from institutionalized and only bonded by their doctrinal proclivities. Societally speaking, this tradition did not last more than a century. Its cradle place, the Great Ci’en Temple, soon became Tantric-focused. The tradition neither has a patriarchal system by itself nor provide a clear dharma-transmission narrative. After two generations, the number of commentaries gradually diminished. Since then, this strand of Yogācāra thoughts is fully dismantled into Chinese Buddhist traditions, such as Chan and Huayan. Along with four major and minor transmission, this tradition is transmitted into Japan and became fully sectarianized as the Hossō sect, which remained as one of the strongest Buddhist sects in Japan.
 
This idiosyncratic tradition offers a set of unique doctrines, such as ""eight consciousnesses and four aspects"" and “three natures,” which represents the Abhidharmic psychological wing of Yogācāra Buddhism. It offers a unique soteriological path by analyzing one’s cognitive process and subsequently acquire the divine cognition to perceive the “true nature” (buddha-nature, so-to-speak) of existence. The title of Xuanzang’s compendium expresses the central idea of this tradition—“merely consciousness.”  Its philosophy draws a similarity with Kantian Transcendental Idealism, which asserts the world we human perceived is bonded by our epistemological limit and supported by a transcendental cognito, and Husserlian Phenomenology, which suspends the ontological inquiry and shifts to study and propose a universal cognitive structure that we human perceive experience. And therefore, nowadays, this tradition is commonly rendered as the Buddhist phenomenology, which contributed enormously to modern scientific disciplines, e.g. cognitive science, psychology, and science of mind.",645,696,1015,727,Guanxiong Qi,2020-07-17 18:17:06.827 +0200,2021-09-29 20:32:31.454 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
848,Sadducees,43,Religious Group (v6),"One of the three primary sects in Second Temple Judaism (alongside the Pharisees and Essenes). The Sadducees are primarily known as being comprised of the social elites, many of whom were part of the priestly society of Jerusalem. The Sadducees that fit this description were heavily involved in political and religious affairs, including the oversight of the temple. Sadducees, however, were also found outside of Jerusalem in the region of ancient Palestine and included Jews of every social class. The only known shared belief among all Sadducees is the determination for a return of the priestly dynasty. The Sadducee's demise is frequently tied to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans in 70 CE, though it is likely that Jews continued to identify with the group even after this event.
The name Sadducee and the origins of the movement are still cloaked in uncertainty. Scholars believe that linguistically the name Sadducee is derived from one of two Hebrew origins. While some propose that the term is related to the Hebrew term tzaddik (“righteous”) and provides context to the movements beliefs, others connect the term to the figure Zadok, the high priest in the days of David and Solomon and argue that the group is in some way connected to a priestly lineage. Although these explanations have been held up as insights into the origins of the Jewish sect and have been used to hint at the early history of the group, there is not enough primary information available to know for certain if there is any tie between the name and the movement’s history. References to Sadducees first appear in the literature of the Hasmonaean period, but there is no definitive history of the sect, though some posit that the elitism of the sect has its origins in earlier periods.
Many of the perceived insights into the Sadducees (close connection with outside rulers, highly Hellenized, etc.) stem from equating elitism with various aspects of culture and society in the late Second Temple period. These conclusions, however, are largely erroneous as the primary source material describing the Sadducees is very limited. Most of the information about the Sadducees aligns with the beliefs and practices of Second Temple Judaism, while distinctive characteristics are derived from what is said about them in the Greek New Testament and what is preserved in the writings of Josephus. Later Christian commentators rely exclusively upon these sources in their discussions of the Jewish sect. Additional information can be gleaned from Tannaitic references that highlight arguments between the tsadukim (likely the Sadducees) and perushim (likely the Pharisees). Ultimately, we have to be cautious and follow the statement of Lawrence Schiffman who stated, ""the views of the Pharisees and Sadducees must remain shrouded in mystery.""",-200,70,485,731,Joshua Matson,2020-07-17 21:22:27.375 +0200,2020-08-14 01:50:54.766 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
849,"""Gaiwiio Religion,"" ""Longhouse Religion,"" or ""The Way of Handsome Lake"" of the Seneca Tribe",43,Religious Group (v6),"""Gaiwiio,"" ""The Way of Handsome Lake,"" or simply ""The Good Message,"" is a new religious movement that emerged among the Seneca tribe of present-day northeastern U.S in the early 19th century. It combined moral and theological elements of Protestant Christianity (especially Quakerism) with Iroquois rituals and cosmology. The founder of the movement, Handsome Lake (1735-1815), was from the Seneca tribe--one of the six great nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (1722-1867). The movement, popularly referred to as ""Longhouse Religion,"" remains active today.

In 1799 Handsome Lake, brother to the Seneca war chief Cornplanter, experienced a vision while in a fevered state. This vision marked the beginning of the Gaiwiio religion. While laying bedbound, Handsome Lake pondered the misfortune of his tribe. The Seneca, once a proud Iroquois Nation, had become a broken people during the burgeoning expansion of a young America. Poverty and alcoholism, in particular, had laid waste to his people. As he drifted into sleep, he was visited by three spirits, which made him well again and, additionally, bestowed upon him a message from the Great Creator and commanded him to spread the instruction among his people. 

The Next day, at the Strawberry Festival, a healthy Handsome Lake conveyed this divinely delivered message to all who had attended. The message primarily contained instructions from the Creator on how to order society on earth. It preached against four ""words"" or evils which the people were to avoid: whiskey, witchcraft, love-magic, and abortion or sterility. Those guilty of these acts must repent to Handsome Lake, or, if the transgression was severe enough, to the Creator. From accounts taken by Quakers at the Strawberry festival, we know that this message was well received and that one could ""feel the weight of the Spirit"" and ""the love of God"" present and flowing among the audience (Wallace 1969, 242). 

In the years to come (1799-1801), Handsome Lake would have new visions sent to him by spirits sent on behalf of the Creator. The second essential vision set out an apocalyptic theology for the followers of Handsome Lake. In it, he saw the death of the earth and the eternal fate of the wicked and the good. The sinful suffered at the hands of the Tormentor (or Punisher), while the righteous reunited with the Great Spirit in the Heaven World. A third vision instructed Handsome Lake to spread his Gospel to all Indians. Thus at the end of these three visions, Gaiwiio had its essential form. It was concerned with living righteously on earth for the sake of eternity, fascinated with the inevitable destruction of the planet, and aimed to convert as many Indians as possible to its ranks.",1750,1850,1016,732,James Waters,2020-07-17 22:37:21.359 +0200,2020-07-23 20:44:39.788 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
850,Pre-Christian Religion / Paganism in Gaul,43,Religious Group (v6),"Gaul was a large region of Iron Age Europe inhabited by Celtic language speaking tribes. Encompassing 191,000 square miles, it included what would become France, Luxembourg and Belgium, and parts of Switzerland, northern Italy, the Netherlands and Germany (particularly the west bank of the Rhine).

Prior to the Roman conquest in 51 BCE, the people of Gaul did not typically create written records of any size. As a result, much of our knowledge of the region is obtained through archaeology, including the names of tribal leaders and native imagery found on Gaulish coins. 

This is augmented by detailed (but not always reliable) written accounts by Julius Caesar and other Classical commentators. In addition, useful comparisons pertaining to culture and religion have been made with other Celtic-speaking cultures in Britain, Ireland and Galatia (Asia Minor). 

Pre-Roman Gaul consisted of a large number of tribes or chiefdoms whose economy was based on herding and agriculture, as well as trade. The religion of pre-Roman pagan Gaul consisted of polytheism, with the possibility of animism as well. Our main evidence includes archaeological data pertaining to the location, layout and orientation of ritual sites, votive offerings and depositions, and burial practices, as well as informed analysis of ethnographic accounts of Gaulish religion and belief, including the training and functions of the Druidic class of religious specialists. 

In addition, some elements of Roman era epigraphy and iconography may shed light on native belief, particularly in regard to Gaulish gods and goddesses and their attributes. Linguistic analysis and comparisons of place-names, personal names, theonyms, and socio-religious terminology from other Celtic regions has proven fruitful, as has examination of possible parallels with religious themes and symbolism from early medieval Irish and British written sources. 

From the available evidence we can discern a vibrant culture in Gaul, whose people were described as wearing stunning brightly coloured clothing and many gold and bronze ornaments, and who were skilled metalworkers, horsemen, mariners and artisans. They valued truth, wisdom, honesty and courage, as well as music, eloquence, poetry and skill.

As in many traditional cultures, religion infused nearly every aspect of daily life, and recent archaeological work has focused on the interconnection between religious spaces and dwellings or settlements. There appear to have been numerous Gaulish deities, whose attributes were associated with aspects of culture (healing, prosperity, warfare, magic, horsemanship, food and drink, arts and fertility) as well as those whose names reflect aspects of the natural world (rivers, wells, trees, groves, animals and birds).
 
Religious ceremonies were presided over by members of the highly-trained Druidic class, who also served in a judicial capacity. They were described as highly skilled arbitrators, moral and natural philosophers, and experts in the nature of (and communication with) the divine. The Druids appear to have also provided counsel to leaders, performed divination and engaged in healing rituals. 

They served as instructors to druidic candidates over a period of many years, and this training involved an immense amount of memorization, as this was an oral culture. The Druids apparently taught the people that the soul was immortal and after death would enter another body, and that the people should ""honour the Gods, do no ill deed, and practice valour."" 

It is important to note that the historically documented training and practices of the Druids in Celtic-speaking regions of Iron Age Europe have little or nothing to do with modern Neo-Pagan druidism or druidry, which are recent occult-based, earth-honoring religions developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.",-600,-51,1017,739,Sharon Paice MacLeod,2020-07-18 18:31:52.981 +0200,2020-08-10 19:55:23.651 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
851,Sikhism in the United States,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sikhs first immigrated to the United States in 1899 from Punjab. During this time, as they were adapting to life in a new country, religion remained an important factor. In the early 1900s, Sikhs remained adamant in wanting to retain their culture and religion. In a 1910 article, “The Tide of the Turbans,” Herman Scheffauer, a German-American journalist, notes that:

“It was the same son of India who, wishing to become a citizen of the United States, refused to remove his turban while taking the oath and so remained a British subject. Always the turban remains, the badge and symbol of their native land, their native customs and religion. Whether repairing tracks on the long stretches of the Canadian or Northern Pacific railways, feeding logs into the screaming rotary saws of the lumber-mills, picking fruit in the luxuriant orchards or sunny hillsides of California, the twisted turban shows white or brilliant, a strange, exotic thing in the western landscape.”
As decades went by, Sikhs’ mentality about Sikhism adapted. By the mid-1940s, Sikhs at Stockton Gurdwara introduced chairs inside the gurdwara, so worshippers were not required to sit on the floor. The community even dropped the requirements for people to remove their shoes and cover their heads when they enter the gurdwara. If one was to walk inside Stockton Gurdwara, the physical space would resemble the inside of a church more than a gurdwara. Bruce LaBrack notes that this is “because they were better educated and more at ease in the American culture milieu [and] began to question some of the practices associated with Sikh Worship.” Sikh practices were classified by Sikhs of this time as “backward and unnecessarily strict interpretations of gurdwara etiquette,” which is completely different than the terminology and spirit of the first wave of immigrants. With the Immigration Act of 1965 allowing more Sikhs to immigrate to the United States, Sikhism reverted back to its more traditional form. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Sikhs have been victims of hate crimes throughout the United States mainly due to two things: the color of their skin and their turbans. As a matter of fact, the first victim of a hate crime in the aftermath of 9/11 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh. Despite the struggle they face in America, Sikhs remain resilient. Today, the number of Sikhs in the United States has grown to over 500,000 with a number of new non-Punjabi converts joining the faith – mainly through the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO) started by Harbhajan Singh also known as “Yogi Bhajan.” Throughout the entire history of Sikhs in the United States, their faith continues to be a key component. This section will look at Sikhism in the United States from when they first immigrated in 1899 to the present day.",1899,2020,1018,740,Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal,2020-07-18 18:55:32.157 +0200,2020-07-23 06:20:57.790 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
852,Pre-Christian Religion / Paganism in Ireland,43,Religious Group (v6),"Historical pagan, pre-Christian Ireland was an autonomous island region of Iron Age Europe inhabited by Celtic language speaking tribes. Encompassing 32,595 square miles, it is situated in close proximity to Britain and the Isle of Man, as well as parts of Continental Europe. 

Prior to the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE, the people of Ireland did not typically create written records of any size. A system of writing known as Ogam was designed specifically for the Irish language (an early form referred to as Primitive Irish), created sometime between the late 4th - early 5th centuries, probably in south-west Ireland. It was typically used for memorial stones and dedications, although names and other data were sometimes recorded on personal items. 

Because of the lack of contemporary written source materials - native or foreign - much of our knowledge of the region is obtained through archaeology. Iron Age Ireland was inhabited by numerous tribes, each ruled by a king to whom the people owed their loyalty. 
Society appears to have been hierarchical, and also organized around kin-groups.

In addition to kings and nobles, there were learned professions such as the druid and harpist, as well as skilled craftspeople. The land contained numerous small farmsteads focused on the production of cereal crops and other plant foods and resources, as well as the herding of livestock (primarily cattle).

In addition to archaeology, useful comparisons pertaining to culture and religion have been made with other Iron Age Celtic-speaking cultures in Britain, Gaul, Continental Europe and Galatia (Asia Minor). 

The religion of pre-Christian pagan Ireland consisted of polytheism, with the possibility of animism as well. Our main evidence includes archaeological data pertaining to the location, layout and orientation of ritual sites, votive offerings and depositions, and burial practices, as well as informed analysis of ethnographic accounts of Gaulish religion and belief, including the training and functions of the Druidic class of religious specialists.

Linguistic analysis and comparisons of place-names, personal names, theonyms, and socio-religious terminology from other Celtic regions has proven fruitful, as has examination of possible parallels with religious themes and symbolism from early medieval written sources from Britain, Continental Europe, and Ireland itself.

From the available evidence we can discern a vibrant pagan culture in Iron Age Ireland, whose people attended socio-religious gatherings at local or tribal assembly sites. Depositions of votive offerings were also made into ritual shafts or pits, and bodies of water (rivers, lakes, bogs, ocean).

As in many traditional cultures, religion would have infused nearly every aspect of daily life, and archaeological work has focused on the interconnection between religious spaces, local settlements, and the landscape, as well as cosmological elements. 

In addition to archaeology, early medieval Irish literature is an important potential source of information. While written down after the introduction of Christianity, early Irish law tracts are believed to reflect aspects of native Irish law, elucidating certain aspects of society and culture. These included an appreciation and respect for values such as truth, wisdom, honesty, loyalty and courage, as well as music, eloquence, poetry and skill.

In addition, there are numerous sagas, poems, mythic narratives and onomastic tales which mention supernatural beings referred to as the 'Síabra' or 'Áes Síde,' and later as the 'Túatha Dé Danann' (the 'People or Tribes of the Goddess Danu'). 

While there is considerable scholarly debate about this body of literature and what pre-Christian material it contains or reflects, the sheer volume of it - and the amount of material pertaining to beings expressly described as gods or goddesses (as well as other mythological or visionary material and themes) - must not only be acknowledged but interpreted with some care and discernment. 

According to the literature, there appear to have been numerous Irish deities, whose attributes were associated with aspects of culture (healing, prosperity, warfare, magic, horsemanship, food and drink, arts, crafts, seership and fertility) as well as those with some associations with aspects of the natural world (rivers, wells, trees, groves, animals and birds).

It should be noted that historical Irish paganism was not solely (or perhaps even primarily) an ""earth religion,"" as that term is commonly understood in the 21st century. The attributes of the deities are highly concerned with culture as well as nature, and this appears to be the case in other Celtic regions as well. 

What is extremely prevalent in the archaeological evidence and the literary sources is a focus on interactions and relationships between human beings and the divine, whether that entails deities, ancestors and / or the Otherworld realms. 

If the laws and the literature reflect
any semblance of earlier cultural beliefs and practices, it is reasonably safe to assume that religious ceremonies would have been presided over by members of a highly-trained Druidic class, who probably also served in a judicial capacity. They still had legal status in Ireland at the time of the 7th-8th century CE law tracts, although this diminished over time. 

In Irish, British and Continental written sources, the Druids of history were described as arbitrators, moral and natural philosophers, and experts in the nature of (and communication with) the divine. They appear to have also provided counsel to leaders, performed divination, and engaged in healing rituals. In addition, they served as instructors to druidic candidates over a period of many years, and this training involved a great deal of memorization, as this was an orally transmitted culture. 

In Gaul, the Druids apparently taught the people that the soul was immortal and after death would enter another body, and that the people should ""honour the Gods, do no ill deed, and practice valour."" Early Irish literature provides examples of similar concepts, and much else besides. 

While the debate over the content of the literary sources was in recent memory stalled in a stand-off over 'nativist' and 'non-nativist' stances, in more recent times Celtic Studies has participated in more refined approaches. By engaging with each text in a nuanced and informed manner, and incorporating useful data from interdisciplinary and comparative methodologies, researchers have the potential and capacity to further illuminate the religious beliefs and practices of Iron Age and early medieval pagan Ireland. 

It is important to note that the historically documented training and practices of the Druids in Celtic-speaking regions of Iron Age Europe have little or nothing to do with modern Neo-Pagan druidism or druidry, which are recent occult-based, earth-honoring religions developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.",-500,900,1019,739,Sharon Paice MacLeod,2020-07-18 19:09:59.470 +0200,2020-08-31 22:43:59.335 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
853,Pre-Christian Religion / Paganism in Northern Britain (Pictland / Scotland),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry examines evidence pertaining to pre-Christian belief in Britain from the region around the Forth / Clyde line northwards, as well as the northern and western Isles. The focus is on historical pagan, pre-Christian northern Britain, which was a region of Iron Age Europe inhabited by Celtic language speaking tribes. During the early medieval era it was sometimes referred to as Pictland, and at the end of the time period in question it was renamed Scotland. The tribes of the region spoke a P-Celtic language (with some affinities to Gaulish, and later, to Welsh, Cornish and Breton), which was supplanted by a Q-Celtic language (Gaelic) brought in by Irish settlers in the 5th-6th centuries.

The region encompasses 30,081 square miles (80, 240 square kilometers), and is situated in close proximity to southern Britain (with which it shared some aspects of language and culture), as well as nearby Ireland, the Isle of Man, and parts of northern and Continental Europe.

Prior to the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE, the people of the region did not create written records using an alphabetic system. However, in some parts of the region, starting in the 3rd-4th centuries, a unique system of pictographic symbols was developed and inscribed on stones and metalwork. This system is ascribed to the Picts, who emerge into the historical record through the writings of Classical and other European commentators. 

The Pictish symbols consisted of animals, birds and fish, as well as 'abstract' symbols whose meanings are not known. Combinations of these symbols may have denoted personal or social identities, tribal boundaries or territory markers, or memorial sites. It is postulated that the Picts may have tattooed these symbols on their skin. 

Because of the lack of contemporary native written source materials, much of our knowledge of the region is obtained through archaeology (especially before written accounts of the Picts).

Iron Age northern Britain appears to have been inhabited by a number of tribes, each likely ruled by a king or chieftain to whom the people owed their loyalty. In addition to kings and nobles, there were learned professions such as the druid, bard, harpist, and various types of skilled craftspeople. The region contained numerous small farmsteads focused on the production of cereal crops and other plant foods and resources, as well as the herding of livestock. 

In addition to archaeology, useful comparisons pertaining to culture and religion have been made with other Iron Age Celtic-speaking cultures in southern Britain, Ireland, Gaul, and other parts of  Continental Europe. The pagan religion(s) of pre-Christian Iron Age northern Britain appears to have consisted of polytheism, with the possibility of animism as well. 

Evidence relating to native religion includes archaeological data pertaining to the location, layout and orientation of domestic dwellings, as well as votive offerings and depositions, and burial practices. Some useful comparisons may be made through informed analysis of ethnographic accounts relating to Gaulish religion and belief, including the training and functions of the Druidic class of religious specialists.

Linguistic analysis and comparisons of place-names, personal names, theonyms, and socio-religious terminology from the region (and other Celtic regions) has proven fruitful, as has examination of possible parallels with religious themes and symbolism in early medieval written sources from southern Britain, Ireland and Continental Europe. 

From the available evidence we can discern a vibrant pagan culture in Iron Age northern Britain, whose people participated in domestic rituals and may also have attended socio-religious gatherings at local or tribal assembly sites. Depositions of votive offerings were made into ritual shafts or pits, caves, and bodies of water (wells, rivers, lakes, bogs), as well as in or near habitations or settlements. 

As in many traditional cultures, religion would have infused nearly every aspect of daily life, and archaeological work has focused on the interconnection between local settlements, possible religious enclosures, and the landscape, including the presence of cosmological elements. 

In addition to archaeology, early medieval Irish and Welsh literature may be
potential sources of comparative information, if used judiciously. While written down after the introduction of Christianity, there are materials pertaining to social organization and legal systems, and aspects of sagas and traditional tales that highlight valued qualities such as truth, wisdom, honesty, loyalty and courage, as well as music, eloquence, poetry and skill. 

In addition, there are numerous sagas, poems, mythic narratives, and onomastic tales that involve druids, deities, supernatural beings, and interactions between humans and the Otherworld realms. While there is considerable scholarly debate about this body of literature and what pre-Christian material it contains or reflects, the sheer volume of it - and the amount of material pertaining to beings expressly described as gods or goddesses (as well as other mythological or visionary material and themes) - must all be acknowledged, but also interpreted with care and discernment.

Epigraphy and iconography from Britain and Gaul during the Roman era may also shed some light on the names and attributes of northern British divinities. 

It should be noted that historical northern British / Pictish / Scottish paganism was not solely (or perhaps even primarily) an ""earth religion,"" as that term is commonly understood in the 21st century. In the various Celtic regions, the attributes of deities are highly concerned with culture, as well as nature. 

What is extremely prevalent in the archaeological evidence and the literary sources is a focus on interactions and relationships between human beings and the divine, whether that pertains to deities, ancestors and / or the Otherworld realms.

854,pre-Christian Irish,43,Religious Group (v6),"Unlike Great Britain and Continental Europe, for which almost everything we know about the pre-Christian religion of the Celtic-speaking peoples comes from either Classical writers or archaeology, Ireland provides us with an abundance of medieval vernacular literature purporting to tell us about the pre-Christian period.  Indeed, the religion of the Irish Iron Age survived to varying degrees well after the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE.  Also unlike the Celtic cultures of Britain and the Continent, where the traditional learned class was systematically attacked and suppressed by the Romans, the pre-Christian Irish had a learned class that continued to flourish, maintaining oral historical records, overseeing the legal and educational systems, and carrying out a variety of religious functions.  It is to this learned class that we owe most of our knowledge of the old religion, as their educational system made heavy use of memorization of verse and prose stories, which were thus originally pedagogical, meant to serve as mnemonic devices to help in remembering other knowledge.  These included information about not only the religion but also the natural world, history, proper behavior, and much else.  Because they played a key role in the educational system, they were designed to also be entertaining and thus more easily remembered.  It is probably because of its pedagogical role that this oral material was eventually preserved, written down by scribes based in the Christian monasteries despite its rich pagan content.  Nonetheless, this preservation appears to have been selective, as the scribes would have been inclined to minimize those elements involving the older faith.  The manuscript literature thus provides us with information about many of the deities (Tuatha Dé), but it provides little information on specific beliefs or rituals, although much in the new religion appears to have been compatible with the old.  It has even been suggested that Christianity first gained a foothold in Ireland through its acceptance by the younger members of the learned class, who saw it as offering only a somewhat different perspective on their existing beliefs,   But as a result, the manuscript material must be used carefully as we cannot be certain that elements within it were not invented within the monasteries rather than reflecting true tradition.  A few things do seem clear.  The old religion and its gods were tied closely to the landscape and the annual agricultural cycle.  The gods occupied an invisible Otherworld closely paralleling our own.  And there was a strong belief in reincarnation.  So, to be fair, though there are many hints in the medieval manuscript literature, we really have almost no direct evidence contemporary with the period in question that can provide us with unbiased information about the nature of the religion.  What I have presented here is, therefore, based on my personal evaluation of these early manuscript materials and a scattering of other evidence.  Other scholars may well disagree with my interpretations, as I tend to assume more continuity in beliefs than some others do.

855,Middle-Class Migrant Muslims in the UAE,43,Religious Group (v6),"The UAE is home to millions of Muslims who exhibit a range of beliefs and practices that reflect the diverse ethnic composition of the country's population. These Muslims are both impacted by local customs and laws governing religion and connected to other places in the world that influence their practice and experiences of religious belonging. In this entry, I provide a general introduction to how religion figures into the lives of middle-class migrant Muslims in the UAE. 

Rather than focus on Emirati citizens, I look at noncitizen residents who have made the UAE their home. This entry is not focused on the working classes of the UAE, employed in sectors like construction or domestic work, nor the ultra-rich, but on migrant Muslims who fall in between the ends of such a spectrum— the people who constitute the UAE’s teachers, doctors, engineers, and business men and women. These men and women are literate, which gives them greater direct access to religious knowledge, and they are educated professionals, which holds implications for their taste and interests in Islam.

While these middle-class migrant Muslims can be mapped across many theological categories, those considered in this entry would generally be categorized as Sunni Muslim. Despite that, their beliefs and practices extend from Salafi inclined, literalist readings of the Quran, hadith, and Islamic tradition to Sufi oriented practitioners who privilege the interior over the exterior.
What characterizes this religious group is their existence and practice of Islam in a state that is not their own. 

Though their religious practice is governed by the UAE, these migrant Muslims do not have a more permanent claim to a long-term presence there. Moreover, they have connections to other places around the world—other religious scholars, sources of authority, and communities—that play a role in their experience of Islam. It is the process of navigating such different pulls that makes this group unique.

As middle-class migrant Muslims, they also have the literary abilities, language skills, technologies, time, and freedom which permits them to access religious knowledge quite independently—by turning directly to scholars online, published books, or attending Islamic classes in one or multiple languages. This capacity to engage an array of Islamic knowledge introduces them to a range of beliefs and practices in the UAE that they likely would not have had access to in their countries of origin. Such particularities hold implications for how they proceed to embrace their faith.",1900,2020,1021,743,Joud Alkorani,2020-07-19 12:16:20.826 +0200,2020-08-13 13:12:54.092 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
857,Wesleyanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Methodist/Wesleyan denomination can be said to have commenced in 1738 When John Wesley, an Anglican pastor,  had an experience of the Holy Spirit on the road to Aldersgate in the outskirts of London. He wrote in his Journal, following the teachings of Martin Luther on righteousness that, “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.”  One of the distinctive features of Methodism/Wesleyanism is what has become referred to as its “quadrilateral;,” the four sources of ecclesiastical authority. These consist of scripture, tradition, experience, and reason. This supplements the Anglican threefold sources, which consist of scripture, tradition, and reason.
To the traditional Reformation doctrines of salvation by faith alone (sola fide) and justification by faith, and antinomianism, John Wesley added certain maxims that distinguished his movement from the larger Reformation tradition. Acutely among them was his notion of perfection in love in the earthly life. This notion is rooted in 1 John:1 12, 17, Hebrews 12:1f., and Matthew 5:48. Christians are to be perfect as their heavenly father is, especially in love. Additionally, Wesley emphasized a doctrine known as “Arminianism” (named for the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius), a rebuke to the Calvinist notion of predestination. Additionally, he stressed the “means of grace” that include of piety, mercy, as well as social and communal practices. With Calvin, Wesley emphasized the “real presence” of Christ in the Eucharistic elements; against Calvin he prescribed an open Communion—even the unbaptized are welcome at the Table of the Lord (he referred to Communion as a potential “converting ordinance.” Another chief ordinance is Holy Baptism, performed either in childhood or in adulthood. The United Methodist Book of Worship contends, “The Baptismal Covenant is God's word to us, proclaiming our adoption by grace, and our word to God, promising our response of faith and love.” Wesley also borrowed the concepts of prevenient grace, original righteousness, and sanctification from other Christian traditions.
Wesley’s closest associates were his brother Charles (primarily known for his proficient hymnody) and George Whitefield (himself a Calvinist who believed in predestination), as well as his mother, Susannah who was his foremost spiritual consort. Methodism/Wesleyanism gave birth to the Holiness Movement, which in turn gave birth to Pentecostalism. The Church of Jesus Christ, Latter Day Saints, was formed by a former Methodist. Methodist/Wesleyan denominations today include the United Methodist Church (primarily in the United States but with a large following in sub-Saharan Africa), the Church of the Nazarene, the British Methodists, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Zion, and merged, united denominations in Canada, Zambia, and Australia. Most denominations have an episcopal, connexional polity – a bishop presides over larger collections of congregations, a superintendent over more local collections, and an ordained elder over individual (or multiple) local churches. Lay participation is encouraged.",1738,2020,1097,750,Tasi Perkins,2020-07-20 18:43:00.735 +0200,2023-02-25 05:31:37.919 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
858,"The New Prophecy or ""Montanism""",43,Religious Group (v6),"The New Prophecy refers to the Christian prophetic movement led by the prophets Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla. Later known as ""Montanism,"" the movement began in the second half of the second century CE in Roman Phrygia, which is in the west-central part of Anatolia, present-day Turkey. It quickly spread beyond Phrygia and, by the mid-third century, had reached Rome, Carthage, Thrace, and Gaul. By the early fifth century, no adherents of the New Prophecy movement remained in North Africa (Optatus of Milevis, Against the Donatists 1.9; Augustine Letter 118.12) or Rome (Praedestinatus, 1.86). In the mid-sixth century, Emperor Justinian I's forces, led by John of Ephesus, attacked Pepouza and burned the group's literature, bringing a decisive end to the already dwindling New Prophecy in Asia Minor. 

	The New Prophecy was controversial. Critics took issue with the movement's ascetic rigor, eschatological beliefs, and the prominent role women played in leading it. However, the most significant source of controversy was the ecstatic prophecies the group's adherents claimed to receive from the Holy Spirit. The movement proclaimed their prophecies constituted supplementary divine revelations with equal or greater authority than those of the previous apostolic traditions. Like the apostle Paul, the New Prophecy, thus, appealed to divine visions as the source of their familiarity with and authorization from Christ. As such, the prophetic movement posed an aggravating challenge to contemporaneous Christian groups whose authority rested entirely upon apostolic succession. 

	In the late third century, the movement was condemned as a heresy. The term ""Montanism"" was bestowed by fourth-century heresiologists.  Later commentators also called adherents of the New Prophecy Cataphrygians, Pepouzians, Quintillianists, and Priscillianists. Scholars have traditionally referred to the New Prophecy movement of the second and third centuries as ""Montanism,"" despite the fact that it is a fourth-century neologism and imbues connotations of heresy not associated with the movement until the late third century. 

	The New Prophecy is known almost exclusively through the third- and fourth-century heresiological accounts of the movement's opponents. These sources also provide fourteen oracles, which scholars believe are genuine expressions of the New Prophecy. A few inscriptions and Tertullian's early third-century writings constitute the only evidence for New Prophecy that survives independently of heresiological texts. Identifying specific texts from Tertullian's corpus as ""Montanist"" has prompted scholars to take Tertullian's views as representative of the broader New Prophecy movement. However, scholars have debated the extent to which Tertullian's early third-century writings represent the New Prophecy movement and its teachings. Several of Tertullian's so-called ""Montanist"" works convey idiosyncratic thoughts that are not consistent with the other evidence for the movement. As such, Tertullian must be treated exclusively as a witness to the New Prophecy's Carthaginian reception in the first decades of the third century and not representative of Montanism elsewhere or at other times.",165,550,1024,753,Camille Leon Angelo,2020-07-20 18:48:22.807 +0200,2020-08-05 22:25:35.340 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
859,Valentinians,43,Religious Group (v6),"Valentinians are an early branch of Christian practitioners that have often been labeled as ""gnostic."" They are generally understood to be Christians who were influenced by the teachings of Valentinus, a second-century teacher and preacher in Rome. Valentinian Christians are best-known for their treatment of God as totally unknowable before Jesus's appearance, their conception of God as a collective entity of Aeons or emanations of the divine, and their belief in a heavenly counterpart that one needed to reunite with.

Our sources for Valentinian thought are split between their own writings and those of their opponents. Until the 20th century, most of our knowledge of the Valentinians came from heresiologists like Irenaeus of Lyons and Tertullian of Carthage, who wrote tractates that stereotyped and condemned their theologies and practices. We also had a few fragments of Valentinus’s own writings and a letter from the Valentinian Ptolemy to Flora embedded in other patristic texts. With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices in the 1940s, we gained access to a broad array of Valentinian texts. These texts gave us a better understanding of Valentinian liturgical practices, exegetical concerns, and cosmological narratives. 

Valentinians have been condemned as heretics since the late second century. However, Valentinus himself was never formally condemned during his lifetime, nor was there any mechanism by which to expel him from the Roman churches in the second century. Valentinians often accused of looking “too much” like other types of Christians and attending the same services, which made them a threat to some Christians who feared that they were duplicitous.

Valentinians writings and theological explorations have often been depicted as having two substantial trajectories, known as the Eastern and Western schools. However, recent scholarship has questioned a clear divide between the two schools. Likewise, scholars have recently questioned how “Valentinian” Valentinus himself was, since the cosmological and theological concerns of second- and third-century Valentinian writers often turn in very different directions than the fragments of Valentinus that have been preserved. 

Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Valentinian thought if their conception of God as androgynous, and that the various emanations of God exist in male-female dyads. This conception of God’s completeness as based on twoness is also expressed in Valentinian descriptions of union with the divine, in which one joins with their accompanying angel in the ritual of the “bridal chamber” in order to achieve redemption.",135,400,6,754,Chance Bonar,2020-07-20 18:57:41.614 +0200,2020-07-26 15:32:09.210 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
860,Kimpa Vita,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Antonian Sect (Antonianism) is a religious movement initiated by Dona Béatrice Kimpa Vita, a young enlightened Kongolese leader, from the eighteen century. This religious  movement advocated for the restoration of the kingdom of Kongo through a spiritual approach grounded on local beliefs and practices, and the rejection of western (missionary) beliefs system perceived as ideological and deleterious to the unity and greatness of the kingdom of Kongo. Kimpa Vita believed that God was not white. She also believed that she was the reincarnation of saint Anthony and used these claims to promote the restoration of a unified and powerful Kingdom of Kongo. The deeper issue behind Kimpa Vita's claims was the idea of ""inculturation"" i.e. christian ideals and values must be understood and interpreted through Kongolese cultural paradigms in order to restore and strengthen the unity of the Kongolese kingdom. Her teaching attracted many followers and ultimately became a threat to the missionaries. She was burnt alive by missionaries in 1706. Despite her death and the collapse of the kingdom of Kongo, Kimpa Vita's spiritual and political intuitions (ideas) are embraced by many African and Congolese people who still perceive her as a prefigure to inculturation and Afrocentrist movements. Nowadays, Kimpa Vita's movement continues in a different way through the ""Ngunza religion"" from Congo-Brazzaville. The Ngunzas venerate and practice a ritual dedicated to Kimpa Vita. Thus, Antonianism and Ngunzanism are two sides of the same coin.",1704,2020,1025,734,Sandry Matondo,2020-07-20 21:30:29.565 +0200,2022-11-08 23:38:40.687 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
862,Ilm-e-Khshnoom,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ilm-e-Khshnoom 'Science of Bliss' refers to the religious group primarily composed by members of the Zoroastrian diaspora currently settled in India (henceforth Parsis). They follow the system of beliefs (also named Ilm-e-Khshnoom) introduced by Behramshah Naoroji Shroff (1858-1927) at the beginning of the 20th century. Shroff’s teachings are based upon an esoteric interpretation of the Avesta, which is the collection of sacred Zoroastrian scriptures. Ilm-e-Khshnoom emerged from colonial India, when the Westernisation process exposed the religious vulnerability of the Parsi community. The teachings of Shroff are based on a set of universal laws of nature that span from the idea of reincarnation to that of the vibrational power dwelling in the practice of Zoroastrian rituals. Shroff, a Parsi himself, claimed to have been initiated to Ilm-e-Khshnoom by the Sāheb Delān 'Master-Hearts', a secluded community of Zoroastrian spiritual masters in Mount Damāvand, Iran. During his stay, he allegedly acquired abilities like telepathy and divination techniques such as astrology. The Parsis who follow Ilm-e-Khshnoom nowadays are a small minority of the approximatively 50,000 Zoroastrians who live in India, mainly in Mumbai and in some cities of the state of Gujarat. There are not exclusion or inclusion criteria for the membership of this religious group other than being born from a Zoroastrian family. Nevertheless, ethnocentrism characterises not only the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom but a large part of the Parsi community, in contrast to another part of the community which promote religious reformism and conversions. Furthermore, the transmission of Ilm-e-Khshnoom across generations has occurred through the familiar nucleus. In effect, families continue to exert a durable impact on the religious canons as well as on the communal ideology and responsibility of Parsis. The followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom emphasise a strict observance of the Zoroastrian rituals and adopt particular principles in the ritual practice. These principles remark the importance of addressing precise thoughts while reciting a given portion of the Avesta correctly accompanied by a specific kinetic motion. They also represent distinctive elements of contradistinction of the followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom against the wider Parsi community. Another distinctive element is the adoption of the liturgical calendar. While the Shenshai is the most widespread calendar among the Zoroastrians of India, the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom advocate the adoption of the Fasli calendar. From the 1980’s, Parsis who follow the teachings of Shroff can be found in US and Canada as well as in Australia.",1907,2020,1027,755,Mariano Errichiello,2020-07-21 19:18:47.807 +0200,2022-11-08 23:39:07.452 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
863,Orphism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Introduction:
Till this day, there is an aura of mystery surrounding the Orphic cult, or what some call Orphism. Based on the mythological figure Orpheus, who descends into the Underworld in order to save his wife Eurydice only to fail. Orpheus is touted for his musical abilities that charms both goddesses, such as Persephone and animals. His musical prowess becomes divine and in the Classical period of the 5th century BC begins to acquire the reputation of establishing a cult according to Plato, Euripides, and, perhaps, Pindar.

Not much is known about the Orphic Cult itself save the textual evidence from the Deverni Papyrus, the golden lamellae, and the so-called “Orphic hymns”. Because of its mysterious nature, scholars come into passionate disagreement over the years: 1) some, such as Edmonds, deny the existence of an Orphic cult, 2) others, like Graf and Johnston, claim that “Orphic/Orphism” was used anytime the ancients wanted to demarcate as something strange, and non-tradition, 3) those who argue on behalf of an Orphic Cult. In recent years, however, it seems that 4) must scholars support the idea of an Orphic movement that spread throughout the Mediterranean in the peripheries of the Greek world, especially in Magna Graecia: the Greek colonies in Italy.

The flourishing of Orphism in Magna Graecia coincides with the advent and proliferation of Pythagoreanism during the same period of the 6th and 5th centuries BC. This has led scholars to notice similarities in the two movements, such as vegetarianism, because both sects believed that the soul could reincarnate into animals, a focus on purity especially in the material world, and a conception of a happy afterlife if the soul remains pure. One wonders whether Magna Graecia and the Italic-Greeks had a knack for eschatological ideas during the 6th and 5th centuries BC, whereas their mainland counterparts would have to wait until the Classical period 5th and 4th for these ideas to travel eastward. If this is right, one can begin to see cracks on old standing narratives: 1) a monolithic idea of Greekness and 2) the perpetual misunderstanding that Greek influence is a one way street where Hellenism is always the influencer and never the influenced. 

Orphic Movement
Returning to the Orphic cult, the little evidence that we possess seems to indicate a scattered cult with shared ideas in cosmology found in the Derveni Papyrus and some golden lamellae and the instructions for the soul in afterlife, found in the golden lamellae that were buried with the deceased. These primary ancient documents detail strange myths and an Underworld that is unfamiliar to anyone who has read the traditional tales of Hesiod and Homer, especially the centerfold position that Dionysius holds in the “Theogony of Orpheus” and the Zagreus myth scattered in the Derveni Papyrus and later in the “Dionysiaca” of the 5th century AD Neoplatonist Nonnos.

Cosmology:
The Theogeny of Orpheus gives the reader a sense of departure of the Orphic cosmology from the Hesiodic one. Time produces an egg with a serpent enwrapped around it. From the egg is born Protogonos the first god who begins to fashion the universe in a way similar to that of Hesiod’s gods: sexually.  From there on come the other gods: Night followed by Ouranous who produces the Titans and from them come the Zeus and Olympians. Zeus then swallows Protogonos and keeps him in his belly in order to recreate the universe. It seems in some places that Protogonos and Zeus become linked in one god. The closest resemblance here is the birth of Athena after Zeus swallowed her mother Metis. The elision of Zeus and Protogonos can be most easily explained by the need to square competing supreme gods by the Orphic cult. Other scholars also posit that the movement had two supreme deities, but it is not quite clear what is the relationship between the two. Nevertheless, by the early Christian era and Late Antiquity, it is Zeus who claims the titles of “first”, “last”, “king”, “fate”, “middle”, and “head”. Whatever the case may be, Orphic cosmology, like its traditional Greek counterpart, contains an ordered universe with Zeus in charge whose intervention in the affairs of the world are not quite clear. Yet, one should never consider Orphic cosmology as exclusive and there is the possibility that the myths of the Odyssey and Iliad were integrated somehow in Orphic cosmology.

One last important medication to the mythic cosmology commonly found in Hesiod is the emphasis of Dionysius role in the myth of Zagreus (Dionysius). According to the Derveni Papyrus commentator and Nonnos, Zeus impregnates Persephone (not Semele), and the latter gives birth to Dionysius. Then, because Zeus marks Dionysius as his successor, the Titans now jealous lure the child Dionysius away with toys, kill Dionysius, and then eat him. In vengeance, and with his furious lightning bolt, Zeus smolders the Titans into black ash whence mankind arises. Then, Zeus and Athena resurrect Dionysius, who either succeeds him in some versions or co-rules with Zeus. As with Protogonos, one can see either a merging of Zeus and Dionysius in the Orphic tradition that represents the unification of Bacchic ritual with more common elements of Greek religion. 

Finally, the most striking departure from the Hesiodic and Homeric traditions is the origin of man from the ashes of the Titans. Some lamellae and a fragment of Pindar seem to allude to this myth. Pindar states, as Rose argues, that man has an ancient grief of the blood guilt in the murder of Persephone’s son. This has led many to believe that the Orphic cult had an idea of soteriology where mankind needs to live a pure life in order to redeem himself so that he may dwell among the heroes as some lamellae state. Pace Rose et alia, Edmonds points to the fact that the only complete version of the Zagreus myth occurs in Nonnos, almost a full millennia after the Derveni Papyrus and that it cannot represent what occurred in the 6th-4th centuries BC. The idea of a fallen man, as Edmonds argue, comes from Christianity in two ways: 1) Nonnos is alive in a period when Christianity is now the official religion of the Roman Empire and many Neoplatonists, like Nonnos and Porphyry, are engage in polemics against Christian intellectuals, and 2) the over-emphasis of the use of texts such as the Derveni Papyrus and the golden lamellae in the 19th-20th century comes from the Protestant-Catholic debate on early Christianity, where Protestants focused on the importance of texts as a concept in order to defend Sola Scriptura. 

Whatever happened on the ground in the ancient period, the little evidence shows that there was a Zagreus myth in the air and that the Orphic cult, as expressed in the Lamellae, focus on bodily purification in order to live among mythological heroes. Whether this purification depends upon the Zagreus myth, I shall leave in mystery and allow the reader to riddle out the hidden secrets of the Orphic as we now turn to the Orphic ritual. 

Ritual:
Apart from what is said in Plato and Euripides’ “Hippolytus”, Orphic ritual at least had an initiation process that included hymns (whether or not the published “Orphic Hymns” were the ones used in the ritual itself). Once the ritual was concluded, the initiate was expected to live a pure life. They could not eat animals since that would require ingesting the soul of a tentative human who reincarnated in the animal. This purity also required the initiate to abstain from murder, since blood in the ancient Greek religion was a source of bodily pollution. Apart from these details, we remain in the dark as to the common ethical behavior of the initiated. Perhaps, Pythagoreanism could serve as a point of comparison, but to generalize too much from one obscure movement Pythagoreanism to another is not conducive. 

At the initiated’s death, a golden “leaf” was placed with the deceased. On this plaque, there are instructions for the soul of the deceased on what he or she do when she is in the Underworld. One group of texts states that the deceased should supplicate the divinities of the Underworld, especially Persephone, in order to pass into the abode of the pure. Another group gives fuller and rather strange instructions. The soul of the initiated must avoid the spring near the white cypress tree and venture to another cold spring that contains the waters of memory. These waters, however, are guarded and the deceased must state that, though he is a child of Earth and Heaven, he is one of heavenly stalk. Once the guards allow him or her, the deceased drinks from the waters and then passes to dwell among the heroes. Some other lamellae add other details. For example, the lamella from Hipponium adds a verb that suggests Bacchic ritual of revelry and madness. Another tablet adds the line “a kid I have fallen in milk”. Torjussen has argued that milk represents the initiation ritual since milk represents the Mily Way as early as the 7th century BC and also represents the purity of the soul. Thus, the righteous souls would live in the Milky Way whereas the unrighteous in the lands of Hades. Pace Torjusses, this last idea is also common to the Neoplatonists starting with Numenius and a degree of skepticism as to what the milk represents is warranted. 

To conclude some final remarks on Orphism, the mystery cult and its adherents tended to display an asceticism that might have depended on their cosmological and eschatological views: perhaps, a corrupt mankind born from the ashes of the Titans can be redeemed through purification. If this is right, the Orphic cult has a remarkable tenure of a millennia that survives into the early Christian period and Late Antiquity. In fact, Lactantius, one of the earliest Church fathers, mentions that Orpheus was close to the eternal truth when he posited a god creator (Protogonos). Many Neoplatonists of the 4th-5th centuries, beginning with Numenius, co-opted Pythagorean-Orphic ideas into their Platonist thought. Moreover, some scholars have argued that the iconography of the Good Shepherd found in early Christian Roman sarcophagi were coopted from the shepherd motif found in Orphic and Bacchic ritual. In time, however, as the historical record shows, both Christianity and Neoplatonism endured into the Middle Ages, whereas Orphism did not.",-550,450,132,733,Juan Dopico,2020-07-21 20:01:04.299 +0200,2022-11-30 17:42:19.465 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
866,Taigu School,43,Religious Group (v6),"The “Taigu School” 太谷學派 (and its various alternative names, such as “Taigu Teaching” 太谷教, “Yellow Cliff Teaching” 黃崖教, “Kongtong Teaching” 崆峒教, “Great Learning Teaching” 大學教, “Great Achievement Teaching” 大成教, etc.) refers to an esoteric genealogy of teaching in China spanning from the eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. The founding patriarch, Zhou Taigu 周太谷 (c. 1762–c. 1832, aka Zhou Gu 周穀, Zhou Xingyuan 周星垣, Kongtongzi 空同子/崆峒子, etc.), was from the Anhui province but mainly preached in Yangzhou of the Jiangnan region. The documentation of him is rare and often vague, but his
followers believed he was the fifth “Sage” (following the several ancient “Sage-Kings” and Confucius) who had inherited the true ""Way,"" and it was reported (probably distortedly) that he had mastered various forms of occult arts, including divination, cure, talismans, incantations, exorcism, invisibility, and the sexual cultivation. Among his many followers, Zhang Jizhong 張積中 (c. 1805–1866, aka Zhang Shiqin 張石琴, Qi xiansheng 七先生, among many other aliases) brought his teaching to the north. In 1856, Zhang settled his family at Yellow Cliff 黃崖山, a remote mountain in Shandong province. More and more people and households joined him, and gradually a semi-independent community took shape. The community did have religious features, but it was by and large based on mutual aid and self-defense in order to keep safely away from the various rebel militia in that time. Nonetheless, it was accused as an “evil cult” and sanguinary oppressed by the local government in 1866, an incident that is usually known as the “Yellow Cliff Massacre.” Zhang’s cousin and fellow disciple, Li Guangxin 李光炘 (1808–1885, aka Li Qingfeng 李晴峰, Li Pingshan 李平山 and Longchuan xiansheng 龍川先生, among many other aliases), preached in the Jiangnan region and accumulated numerous followers, mostly men of letters, including many contemporary celebrities, such as the politician Mao Qingfan 毛慶藩 (1849–1927) and the novelist Liu E 劉鶚 (1857–1909). Starting from 1902, the teaching was based in the Guiqun Academy 歸群草堂 in Suzhou and was led by Li’s disciple Huang Baonian 黃葆年 (1845–1924, aka Huang Xipeng 黃隰朋 and Huang Guiqun 黃歸群), which was commonly known as the “Huang School 黃門” until it gradually declined and finally dissolved in the mid-twentieth century. The teaching defies a rash generalization. Extant analects of Zhou Taigu are mostly his idiosyncratic exegesis on the Confucian classic The Book of Change 易經, which has a syncretic inclination, integrating the Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist thoughts and even Millennialism beliefs. Biographical accounts of Zhou Taigu are also full of miracles, which resemble what are often seen in what we now call “popular religions” or “folk religions.” This tendency toward mysticism is observable in both Zhang Jizhong’s Yellow Cliff community and Li Guangxin’s master-disciple lineage. However, Huang Baonian, who was already a prominent Confucian scholar before leading the Guiqun Academy, made clear efforts of eliminating the occult elements from the teaching and establishing its Confucian legitimism.",1762,1950,1030,766,Xiangjun Feng,2020-07-22 00:14:06.167 +0200,2021-09-28 01:45:17.910 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
867,Nyingma Treasure,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Nyingma Treasure tradition is a subgroup of practitioners within the Nyingma (Rnying ma) School of Tibetan Buddhism. Its scripture authority comes from revealed texts (with varying methods for revelation), rather than translated or transmitted texts from India.


In contrast to the Sarma (Gsar ma, literally the “New School”) traditions, who draw their scriptural authority from newly transmitted and translated scriptures from India, the Nyingma School (literally the “Old School”) traces its religious pedigree back to the time of the Tibetan Empire. There are two modes of scriptural transmissions for the Nyingma School: (1) the distant lineage of transmitted precepts (bka’ ma); and (2) the close lineages of Treasures (gter ma). The distant lineage of transmitted precepts refers to (oral) teachings that can be traced back to the Buddha’s time through an unbroken lineage; while the close lineages of Treasures refer to revealed teachings that are said to be concealed by enlightened masters of the past and assigned to be rediscovered by predestined Treasure revealers (gter ston) in the future.


The Treasures come in two forms, materials objects and sacred texts. The origins of these Treasures are usually associated with Buddhist masters from India who visited Tibet in the past. The most important teacher associated with the Treasure tradition is the Indian tantric master Padmasambhava (Vimalamitra is also a popular choice at this time, although his important diminished compared to Padmasambhava in later times). He is said to have visited Tibet at the request of the Buddhist king Tri Songdetsen (Khri srong lde btsan), where he subjugated many local deities and spirits, converted them to protectors of Buddhism, defeated the opposing Bon masters, commissioned many translations of Buddhist texts, and left behind Treasure teachings all over Tibet. Yeshe Tsogyel, his main consort and disciple, is said to be responsible for the concealment of these teachings, entrusting them to local guardian deities, and ensuring their successful delivery to future Treasure revealers.


The process of Treasure discovery usually begins with a vision or a dream of prophecy. The Treasure revealer will be told in the vision or dream about the place, time, and method for extracting the Treasure. After a successful retrieval, s/he will usually receive a Treasure casket and/or a yellow scroll with encoded letters or khandroma scripts (mkha’ ’gro ma, or ḍākinī). Because of this association, as well as her special talent with language and words, the goddess khandroma, in her divine or human form, is commonly summoned in the process of decoding the Treasure scroll. After decoding, the Treasure revealer then records the teaching in writing and form a Treasure cycle. A standard cycle of Treasure teaching usually includes multiple genres, starting with a certificate authenticating the teaching, and ranging from ritual manuals, oral instructions, life stories, religious histories, prophecies, and doctrinal exegeses.",1200,1500,96,752,Jue Liang,2020-07-22 01:43:23.881 +0200,2020-08-14 16:56:51.986 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
869,Sichuan Esoteric Buddhist Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"Shortly after Emperor Wu 武 of the Tang dynasty initiated the Huichang 會昌 Suppression of Buddhism in 842 CE, Tang Esoteric Buddhism lost the imperial patronage and fell into decline. While esoteric Buddhist activities suffered severely in the capital Changan, it was believed that a lay Buddhist named Liu Juzhi 柳居直 (855-907, also known as Liu Benzun 柳本尊, “the principle master Liu”) received the transmission of esoteric Buddhist teachings, especially the incantations efficacious in curing diseases and eliminating evil spirits, and devoted himself to spreading his teachings in Yizhou 益州 (nowadays Chengdu 成都) and surrounding areas. 

Grottoes related to Liu Benzun’s esoteric Buddhist cult were built in Anyue 安岳 and Dazu 大足 county in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Both the Pilu 毗盧 (Vairocana Buddha) Cave in Anyue and the niche 21 of Mt. Baoding 寶頂 (Summit of Jewels) in Dazu preserved large-scale tableaux depicting ten scenes of Liu Benzun’s self-mutilation. Chinese scholars argue that the tableau in Dazu was produced later than the tableau in Anyue as a remodeled version of it. Mt. Baoding, as a prominent part of the Dazu Rock Carvings (listed as a World Heritage Site), was famous for a series of grottoes presenting varied themes of Buddhist teachings. According to the entry from a Southern Song geographical guidebook and the inscriptions from two Southern Song steles preserved at Mt. Baoding, these grottoes belonged to Buddhist practitioner Zhao Zhifeng's 趙智鳳 (1159-1249) carving project, which aimed at propagating esoteric Buddhist teachings inherited from his patriarch Liu Benzun as well as the secular value of filial piety. Evidence of this carving project’s emphasis on the esoteric tradition can be found as the inscription in niche 21, which writes Liu Benzun’s honorific title as “the supreme master of Tang Esoteric Buddhism.” 

Due to the lack of extant historical texts, the study of Liu Benzun’s esoteric Buddhist cult was limited to the analyses of stele inscriptions, sculptures, and stone relief carvings. Most scholars hold the opinion that, contrary to the statement claimed in his biographical inscriptions, Liu Benzun did not obtain an orthodox transmission from Tang esoteric Buddhist patriachs. Moreover, scholars remain skeptical about the account of Zhao Zhifeng’s studying at the major practice hall of Liu’s teachings. Based on interpretations of the carvings at Mt. Baoding, scholars suggest that Zhao established this site as a cultic center where the cult of the deified lay Buddhist Liu Benzun was integrated with Mahayana Buddhist traditions, Confucianism, and Daoism. 

The stone inscription and tableaux preserved in Anyue and Dazu areas illustrated that the esoteric Buddhist cult prevalent in the Sichuan area from Late Tang to Southern Song was a regional Buddhist cult with distinctive doctrines and practices which embodied an amalgamation of Tang esoteric tradition, exoteric Buddhist traditions, and local beliefs.",855,1279,1031,730,Yi Liu,2020-07-22 11:02:32.389 +0200,2020-08-02 13:00:08.553 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
870,Postsocialist Mongolian Buddhism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Before the socialist period (1921-1990), Buddhism was the main religion in Mongolia. In 1936, before the violent religious purges of the late 1930s there were around 767 monasteries in Mongolia and somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 lamas (robed monastics) in the country. By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country, an estimated 14,000 having been killed during the period. Following these purges of the late 1930s, religious activities of all kinds were severely restricted during the socialist period. Only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid was allowed to operate in Mongolia’s capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Due to active repression during the socialist period, most of the attendees of this temple were the elderly, particularly older women. In the winter of 1989-1990, Mongolia, dialoguing with broader democratic movements in the socialist world, had a Democratic Revolution. Following the revolution, religious freedoms were ensured and people once again began to practice religion in public. Since 1990, Buddhism has become one of the main religions in Mongolia, mostly following the Vajrayāna tradition. Although it shares many similarities with other Vajrayāna schools, in particular the Gelug and Nyingma lineages, Buddhism in Mongolia has unique characteristics that come from its local religious heritage, Mongolian beliefs systems and translocal organised religious groups, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. Following the lifting of religious restrictions at the start of the democratic period, Mongolian lamas who had been lamas before the socialist purges once again donned robes and began to practice in public. These lamas reinhabited old temples and built new ones and began to take on new students. These lamas set about reinvigorating old traditions that had been kept alive in secret during the socialist period or remembered from their youth. At the same time as local practices were re-emerging, transnational Buddhist organisations (mostly from the Vajrayāna lineages) came to Mongolia to assist local efforts to re-establish Buddhism in the country. Many young novices were encouraged to go to India to study at monasteries connected to Tibetans in diaspora. Postsocialist Buddhist practice in Mongolia has also been characterized by the growth of other ritual practices and translocal religious traditions. These include local ritual practices, such as Mongolian shamanism, that have been gaining in popularity during the democratic period, and translocal religious traditions, such as Christianity and new religious movements. Buddhism in the contemporary period, as was the case in the presocialist period, has geopolitical significance. Its historical ties to Tibet and the Dalai Lama have been the source of geopolitical tensions with China. The relationships between Tibetans in diaspora and international organizations have internally affected Mongolian Buddhist hierarchies as well as lay Buddhist beliefs.",1990,2020,1032,751,Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,2020-07-22 11:14:36.549 +0200,2020-07-27 10:10:23.768 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
871,Spiritualism,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1948, young sisters Maggie and Katy Fox reported to their family that not only was there a spirit living in their house, but they’d learned how to communicate with it. Friends and neighbors around their house in upstate New York came to bear witness to the spirit’s “rappings,” the girls quickly became celebrity mediums, and the Spiritualist movement took off. 

Spiritualism coalesced around a belief that the dead live on in a “spirit world” separated from the world of the living by a thin veil. In this spirit world, individual identities and personal connections persist, and the dead can continue to grow and to spiritually mature. The movement’s central practices include seances, trance lectures, mediumship, healings, and other modes of communication with the spirit world. The commercial success of events like public seances and products like Ouija boards have blurred the line between Spiritualism-as-entertainment and Spiritualism-as-religion from the tradition’s earliest days. Spiritualists also eschew central organization and have no formal markers of religious affiliation, so no precise figures exist for affiliation. However, scholars estimate that anywhere from 3 to 11 million Americans were participating in Spiritualism at the movement’s peak in the late 19th century.

Drawing on previous religious traditions like Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, and New Thought, Spiritualism followed in the iconoclastic footprints of other new religious movements that came out of the Burned-over District in the 19th century. Early Spiritualists denounced dogmatism and sectarianism of organized religion, and spoke out against the Calvinist notion that humankind is innately sinful. In turn, most Christian churches explicitly disavowed Spiritualism, warning congregants that it was a fraud – or worse, that it was witchcraft. Still, many Spiritualists have historically been practicing Christians, and some churches (especially Quaker, Universalist, and Unitarian churches) have either tacitly or even explicitly welcomed Spiritualism as an outgrowth of Christian practice. Some Spiritualists founded churches of their own, and several associations of Spiritualist Churches exist to this day. The movement also had strong ties to social reform movements, including abolition and women’s suffrage.

Spiritualist practice was originally centered in the northern U.S., with another notable pocket of popularity around New Orleans. English-language periodicals, Spiritualist camps, and travelling mediums also connected American practitioners to a transnational network that grew to extend through Great Britain, parts of Canada. The movement was also briefly in vogue throughout continental Europe. Although Spiritualism experienced another surge of popularity in the wake of WWI, it has never regained its 19th century status in the religious and cultural mainstream.",1848,2020,1033,738,Joanna Smith,2020-07-22 16:44:51.207 +0200,2023-04-23 02:56:59.575 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
873,The Branch Davidians,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Branch Davidians were a millenarian sect active in the United States from 1960’s through 1993. The group developed out of a Seventh-Day Adventist offshoot called the Davidian Adventists, which believed itself to be the pure remnant of a now-global Adventist church that had grown lax and sinful. In contrast to Adventist understandings that the Kingdom of God would come about through a spiritual transformation of the world, the Davidians taught that the Kingdom of God would be physically established by a second Christ in the modern-day land of Palestine. In 1935, the Davidians moved to a large farm in Waco, TX, from which they proselytized (mainly by mail) about the imminent return of Christ.

After the death of Davidian founder Victor Houteff in 1955 (and after Christ failed to materialize on the day that Houteff’s widow predicted in 1959) the group began to splinter, and by the early 1960’s it re-coalesced around members Ben and Lois Roden, who both eventually assumed the mantle as prophets and renamed the group the “Branch Davidians.” In 1981, a recent convert named Vernon Howell began to stake claims to the prophetic role that Lois Roden still held. Out of the power struggles that followed Roden’s death in the mid-1980s, Howell emerged the clear leader of the Branch Davidians. After a trip to Israel where he claimed to have had a vision of angelic forces, in 1990 he legally changed his name to David Koresh and began to teach that he was a second Christ sent to complete the mission that Jesus had started by ushering in the end of days. 

Koresh and a group of over 100 followers lived communally at Mount Carmel, their compound in Waco, Texas. There, members participated in lengthy daily Bible studies led by Koresh. They believed that he had been sent by God to reveal the full meaning of the Christian Bible, and in particular, to unfold the narrative of the imminent apocalypse. They believed the apocalypse would be triggered by a conflict between the Branch Davidians and the forces of “Babylon” that would take place in the land of Palestine at some point in the near future. Aiming to purify themselves in preparation for the end of days, they sought to live as a perfect community; they came to see themselves as a divine family, with adults spiritually married to Koresh and all of the children spiritually his – and many of them biologically his own, as well. 

In the spring of 1993, when federal agents – legally spurred by an arrest warrant for Koresh on weapons charges, but also deeply motivated by fears driven by the anti-cult movement – began a violent siege on the group’s compound. After 51 days, the compound went up in flames, killing 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh. The movement was effectively ended, though some believers survived, and though some other groups have risen up to claim the name of Branch Davidian. Some elements of life at Mount Carmel remain contested to this day, with conflicting reports from members and disaffected ex-members emerging during and after the siege.",1962,1993,1035,738,Joanna Smith,2020-07-22 17:05:48.732 +0200,2020-08-16 15:07:18.828 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
877,The International Network of Engaged Buddhists - INEB,43,Religious Group (v6),"The International Network of Engaged Buddhists - INEB is a web of Buddhist organizations, religious leaders, activists, and scholars in more than 25 countries, mainly Asia and some West regions. Founded in Thailand in 1989 under the initiative of the writer and social activist Sulak Sivaraksa with the participation of several Buddhist and some non-Buddhist figures, the network appointed three prominent patrons representing the major traditions of Buddhism: The XIV Dalai Lama (Vajrayāna​), Thich Nhat Hanh (Mahāyāna), and Maha Ghosananda (Theravāda). In that regard, this entry aims to document the shared values and practices of the members of this organization, which congregates around the concept of engaged Buddhism, a notion that implies a paradigm shift in contemporary Buddhist ethics, promoting civic engagement to address the social ills of modern societies from a Buddhist perspective.

In the 1960s Vietnam, Thich Nhat Hanh coined the concept of engaged Buddhism to stress the necessity of an active involvement of Buddhism toward social suffering, offering spiritual and material support to the ones in need. In that context, it particularly implied organizing monastic and lay Buddhists in networks of peace activism and welfare aid to address the calamities of war and propose concrete ways to overcome them. 

Since then, the notion of engaged Buddhism has been used in academic and non-specialized circles to refer to a plurality of Buddhist movements -in Asia and around the world- profoundly concerned with different forms of civic engagement, starting from the late 19th century to this time. In that sense, engaged Buddhism accounts for a modern trend that emerged parallel in different regions of Asia and across the major Buddhist traditions. Consequently, it does not constitute a new Buddhist school or path (yāna) but a way of interpreting Buddhism as socially committed and adapting its traditional teachings to the modern world's social needs. 

As such, engaged Buddhism finds a broader context in the concept of Buddhist modernism, a term developed by Heinz Bechert that expresses the multiple transformations Buddhism suffered in modernity by its interaction with Western culture. One key characteristic of this period is the tendency of a variety of Buddhist reform movements to engage with social work and activism amid times of war and colonialism -although some authors diminish the role of Western influence in the genesis of engaged Buddhism, underscoring its Asian roots. 

From a doctrinal perspective, engaged Buddhism represents a new paradigm in Buddhist ethics. Even though some of its proponents emphasize the social dimension of the Buddha's teachings from which engaged Buddhism continuously draws inspiration, the consensus among scholars leans to consider that the broad scope and high intensity of the social commitment found in contemporary Buddhism constitutes a new phenomenon. In that way, engaged Buddhism embraces the moral obligation to take action in front of social suffering and offers innovative responses to address modern society's social ills by combining elements of tradition and modernity. Indeed, how much each pole -tradition and modernity- signifies in that formula remains a contested issue among scholars and Buddhist leaders.   

Considering the vast extension of engaged Buddhism, its pledge to civic commitment assumes various forms. In some cases, it focuses on social welfare and aid through civil society organizations. In other cases, it takes a political stance in front of social abuse and oppression, denouncing the culture of consumerism, corporate greed, and political corruption, among other social ills, and offering alternatives for a social order aligned with Buddhist and secular values. Sometimes it limits its efforts to one core issue, such as environmentalism, peace activism, gender equality, human rights, or battling poverty, discrimination, and social injustice. Other times it assumes every aspect of the social agenda.                  
 
Again, there is no absolute uniformity among the engaged Buddhist movements regarding the means to address social suffering. However, some key features appeared in engaged Buddhism during the last decades, especially around the sphere of influence of the International Network of Engaged Buddhists - INEB, the larger organization of its kind to date. 

Under that lens, engaged Buddhists conceive social action as spiritually-rooted, which implies cultivating the practice of meditation as capital means to inspire and sustain every civic effort and promote spiritual friendship (kalyāṇa-mitratā) to involve the Buddhist sangha in a collective endeavor. According to traditional Buddhist principles, it is also a compassionate and non-violent action. Moreover, it seeks interreligious cooperation, finding common ground for social harmony rather than imposing a Buddhist doctrine. 

Similarly, it looks for interorganizational cooperation, overcoming political biases. It combines local and global approaches, searching for solutions at different levels of society and ultimately pursuing world peace. Finally, engaged Buddhist action finds a recurrent source of inspiration in the concept of interdependence -a modern interpretation of the social dimension of the pratītyasamutpāda Buddhist teaching. In doing so, it understands the social experience in the world as a profoundly interrelated one: among citizens, humans with other sentient beings, and society with nature.",1989,2022,1542,772,Manu Ato-Carrera,2020-07-22 18:14:53.247 +0200,2022-11-08 23:39:29.573 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
879,Free Methodist Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"A Christian denomination in the Wesleyan/Holiness tradition which broke away from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1860. The major issue leading to the split concerned disagreements over slavery. The Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) still had many slaveholders after the schism in 1844 saw the creation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MEC, S). Official church policy recognized slaveholding as sin, but in practice had accepted the reality of the practice and attempted to justify it under several theories (e.g., paternalism toward slaves, keeping slaveholders in the church). Roberts and other abolitionists saw this compromise as a violation of the ethical precepts of Christianity and their Wesleyan heritage (John Wesley had was an abolitionist in Britain). However, the direct cause of the formation of the Free Methodist Church was a series of political maneuvers in Roberts’ home conference which saw Roberts and several other pastors expelled from the MEC. There is a split in the scholarship as to whether Robert’s abolitionist views lead to the political maneuvers or was merely one view amongst many that angered important parts of the church’s hierarchy (see Snyder, 406-7).
	Upon establishing the new denomination, Roberts ended the practice of ‘pew renting’ by which wealthy individuals could ‘rent’ a pew in church with better visibility, both for and of themselves. He also ended instrumental music in churches, not on grounds against such music, but against the practice of paying trained musicians out of the church’s funds which could have gone to other needs. Like much of the holiness tradition of the nineteenth century, simplicity was a virtue.
Currently, the church has less than 100,000 members in the United States but totals more the one million total members worldwide. It is episcopal in organization with three bishops, each based in the USA. The church is connected to five universities in the United States: Roberts Wesleyan in New York, Spring Arbor in Michigan, Greenville University in Illinois, Central Christian University in Kansas, and Seattle Pacific in Washington; and another four internationally. The church is also affiliated with several non-denominational schools, including Azusa Pacific in California, and Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky.
The Free Methodist Church fits nearly all definitions of ‘evangelical’ and members are generally theologically and politically conservative (in the USA) though the latter has more diversity among congregants. Among the other Wesleyan related churches, Free Methodists are most similar in theology to the Church of the Nazarene and the conservative (sometimes called ‘traditional’) wing of the United Methodist Church due to their teachings of both progressive and instantaneous sanctification at some point after justification. This experience has many names from different theologians but most use the terms ‘Entire Sanctification’ or ‘Second work of grace’ to describe it.",1860,2020,1103,773,Steven Lane,2020-07-22 19:27:44.688 +0200,2020-08-11 17:21:08.721 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
880,Egyptian Salafism (inluding North Africa and West Asia),43,Religious Group (v6),"Salafis' main aim is to practice Islam as the ""pious predecessors"" (al-salaf al-salih) of Prophet Muhammad practiced it. This means overlooking or even shunning any practice or belief that is deemed an accretion to what the earliest Muslims did or believed. Salafi thought is often linked to the Saudi Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, but scholarship suggests that the movement has roots in 19th century Islamic Egyptian thought. Traces of Salafi practice and belief can be found worldwide.
The main sources of Sunni practice and beliefs are the Qur'an, the normative example of the Prophet Muhammad (sunna) and the lifestyle of the early generation of Muslims. 
The intellectual roots of the movement lie in the thought of the eighteenth-century Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab (d.1791). A man of little traditional religious training, Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab nonetheless sought to rectify what he perceived to be the unlawful accretions to Islam and Islamic practice that he observed in his people in what is today Saudi Arabia. He wanted to eliminate the practice of venerating saints and sought to place tawhid (the belief in Allah’s oneness) at the center of Islamic belief. Any actions that were deemed antithetical to this or were seen as an innovation (bid‘a) were to be condemned and eliminated.  
But the term Salafism is a tricky one. Scholars like Henri Lauzière explain that there are two usages for the term. Although modernists religious scholars like Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (d. 1897) and Muhammad ‘Abduh (d. 1905) did not actually call themselves Salafi, they are often credited with having spearheaded the movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These “Modernist Salafis,” as Lauzière calls them, strove to “rearticulate their religion in terms that were more relevant to contemporary realities and more intelligible and appealing to the rational minds of the educated elite.”  Like Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, they viewed the immediate followers of Prophet Muhammad (al-salaf al-salih) as the exemplars of pious Islam. They were thus committed to the example of the salaf and to the text but did not believe that this should be a hindrance on their ability to adapt aspects of the law to help the Muslim world (umma) move forward in the ever-changing, modernizing world.  
“Purist Salafis,” on the other hand, are exclusionary in that they view that theirs is the only form of Islam that could lead to salvation. It is the pure Islam of the salaf, “unsullied by any innovation, deviation or accretion and uncontaminated by exogenous influences” that should be followed by all.  Lauzière argues, however, that, in the beginning, Purist Salafism did not completely reject religious compromise. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, leading Salafi activists “modified their understanding of Islamic reform…mainly to accommodate political considerations and to increase the likelihood of achieving political independence from colonial powers.”  They thus constructed a rigorist form of Salafism that emphasized purity but sought to unite and gain a following throughout the Muslim world.  Post-independence, however, Purist Salafis no longer had to downplay their exclusionary vision of Islam. This form of Salafism “responded to the challenge of modernity by escaping to the secure haven of the text, but it treated rational moral insight as fundamentally corrupting of the purity of the Islamic message,” stunting its growth and ability to respond to modern needs and inquiries.  Despite this, it was the purists who continued to thrive, while modernists, having played their part during the colonial period, fell by the wayside.
States like Saudi Arabia sought to spread this brand of Salafism globally since the 1970s through preachers, funding Salafi mosques and promoting and distributing Salafi texts worldwide.",1870,2015,1038,774,Nareman Amin,2020-07-22 20:54:20.322 +0200,2020-08-03 07:44:07.459 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
882,Orphism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Orphism was a mystery cult of enduring perplexity: it is of obscure origin, vague doctrine, diverse practice, loose membership, and indeterminate extinction.  Its sole fixture is the centrality of a canon of largely eschatological texts attributed by believers to the mythical Orpheus.  The cult is attested textually in the mid 5th c. B.C. and  archaeologically from the 4th c. B.C. to the 3rd A.D.  The most extensive writings about it were by non-practitioners, principally Neoplatonists and Christians, writing centuries after the last archaeological evidence of its being practised.  It may have had scattered adherents into the 4th c. A.D., as evidenced by the composition of the Orphic Argonautica.  It appears not to have survived under the Christianization of the Roman Empire.

|  The very term “Orphism” appears to be an exonym, but it is accepted as a valid in so far as there were, according to Plato, missionaries called orpheotelestai, whom he portrays as charlatans, and Orphikoi, writers of Orphic texts.  Modern scholarship on Orphism may be divided into minimalist and maximalist schools: the minimalist, predominant until the 1970’s, and represented by Willamowitz, defines Orphism as merely Orphic texts and teachers thereof, with no fixed doctrine; the maximalists, e.g. Graf and Johnston, as a community of eschatological belief coïnciding indefinitely with the cult of Dionysus, possessed of peculiar texts, rituals, initiators, initiates, and missionaries.  

  |  The core of modern knowledge of Orphism is the Orphica, a body of poems of doubtful authorship, but which believers ascribed to Orpheus (non-believers explicitly doubted the attribution), whose matter treats with a distinct theogony and exchatology.  Besides this are other texts of ritualistic nature, many shared with the Dionysian tradition.  These texts are preserved principally in the Derveni papyrus (the oldest Greek papyrus, and one of the most remarkable ever discovered), and the diverse aureae lamellae (Golden Tablets), eminent among which is the Gold Leaf from Hipponium.  They contain eighty-seven hexametric hymns, along with twenty-four rhapsodies.

|  Much of what is now taken to be Orphic doctrine was  formalized by Neoplatonic philosophers in late antiquity, such as Proclus, Olympiodorus, and Damascius, who were writing long after new Orphica had ceased to be produced.  In fact, it appears that multiple theogonies circulated among the Orphica, in the form of commentaries on the sacred texts.  Their shared features, which are at most a vague approximation of what may inaccurately be termed Orphic doctrine, suggest a belief in man’s dual nature, viz., Titanic–wicked and Olympian–good; possibly, an original sin; almost certainly, a concern with initiation and ritual purity that would grant some form of afterlife and escape from rebirth and divine punishment.

The teletai, or rituals of initiation, are unknown.  As in contemporary mystery cults, the rites were probably known only to a specialist class.  While the mysteries revealed at initiation do not appear in ancient sources, some idea of their nature may be formed from the Orphic texts.  To judge from the opening of the Derveni papyrus, it is likely that initiation into the Orphic mysteries entailed learning the distinctive theogony presented in the literature.  Plato’s references, the Orphic Argonautica, and the Lithica (on the magical properties of certain stones) strongly suggest a belief in purificatory magic.

|  In sum, if any essence of Orphism is to be found, it is in adherents’ belief that certain texts, mainly about theogony and eschatology, were composed by Orpheus and spoke the truth.  The interpretation of these texts, as elsewhere in Greek religion, was not a matter of fixed doctrine.",-450,425,1040,760,Marshall Buchanan,2020-07-23 00:31:28.644 +0200,2020-07-25 04:54:35.192 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
883,Catholics in the People's Republic of China (PRC),43,Religious Group (v6),"This group includes all Catholics in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (i.e. mainland China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) from its founding in 1949 to the present. It includes believers who participate in the registered (or ""above ground"") part of the church as well as the unregistered (or ""underground"") part of the church, and those in both urban and rural locations.
In 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Chairman Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist Party (KMT), and established the PRC, there were an estimated four million Catholics in China. Whereas the KMT government supported them and had established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, the CCP (even before 1949) had begun to persecute Catholics as agents of foreign imperialism. Broader CCP efforts to eradicate all religion in favor of Marxist atheism began in the 1950s. Fr. Beda Chang (Zhang Boda 张伯达), the first Catholic martyr under CCP rule, was martyred in 1951. After resisting CCP pressure, a large group of Catholics in Shanghai, including its first Chinese bishop, Ignatius Kung Pin-mei (Gong Pinmei 龔品梅), was arrested in 1955. 
In 1957 the government established the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), a government body responsible for ensuring compliance with the demand that the Church in China must be “independent” and self-sustaining, with no official ties to the Vatican or the Pope. A percentage of clergy accepted these demands, and formed the state-approved official, or “above-ground” church, while the majority of Catholics, who rejected these demands as incompatible with the Catholic faith, became known as the unofficial, or “underground” Church. The CCPA began orchestrating the appointment of bishops without papal approval, which continued until 2018, when a controversial agreement between the Holy See and the PRC government was signed. Since 2018, the government has continued to pressure underground clergy to agree to a separation, or “independence” from the Holy See.
During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), all perceived political enemies of Mao were persecuted, and believers of all religions, including official and underground Christians were killed or suffered mental or physical mistreatment. After Mao’s death, official churches reopened, but still under the CCPA’s oversight. To the surprise of many, the number of Christians had grown during these silent years, and continued to expand from the 1980s to the present. Today China has an estimated 10-12 million Catholics, and many more Protestant Christians.",1949,2020,1132,777,John Lindblom,2020-07-23 02:02:18.430 +0200,2021-09-29 20:35:45.217 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
884,Sub Saharan Africa Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"European missionaries brought Christianity to Sub Saharan Africa with the goal of converting the population of the region. They were indeed successful in that the local population took Christianism and made it their own. Hence was born African Independent Churches in the early twentieth century leading later to the Pentecostal movement. After the wave of independences from colonial rule in the 1960s, the independent churches thrived until the 1970s when the Pentecostal movement which was at that point an underground movement became full blown. It is now becoming the dominant form of Christianity in Africa attracting converts from all religions, tribal and ethnic groups, and all walks of life. 

The movement is defined by the day of Pentecost and refers to the encounter with God in the Bible’s book of the Acts of the apostles. Pentecostals believe they receive an impartation of God’s spirit when they confess the name of Jesus. Its main pillars are the concept of being born again, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongue, the divine healing, the eschatological belief of the return of Jesus Christ, and all wrapped in the concept of the full gospel. First, the concept of ‘born again’ refers to a spiritual birth of an individual which in the African context connect the person to the invisible world. Second, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a Christian concept of spiritual empowerment which is also found in African spiritual belief which gives the person a spiritual awareness and discernment. Third, the divine healing mimics African belief that a person can be supernaturally healed in opposition to modern medicine. Finally, the return of Jesus Christ is similar to African eschatological belief that there is an invisible world out there which controls the visible world.

 In fact, African cosmology assumes two worlds: one which is invisible and populated with spirits and the other which is the visible world. The interaction between the invisible and visible worlds determines human’s faith. Pentecostals practice exorcisms where evil spirits are cast out followed with weeping, laughing, and screaming. They engage in what is known as spiritual warfare, praying, and fasting. These beliefs are ingrained in Africans’ psyche and were comfortably found in Pentecostal belief generating what is known as African Pentecostalism. It gives people a sense of self, meaning, and reconcile years of exploitation with the newfound identity. It encourages free enterprise, hard work, and self-determination.",1907,2022,1041,744,Azizou Atte oudeyi,2020-07-23 02:16:24.816 +0200,2022-05-08 00:54:56.460 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
885,Contemporary West African Vodun,43,Religious Group (v6),"The word Vodun means spirit in Fon and Ewe, two languages spoken in coastal Benin, Togo, and South East of Ghana. The Vodun religion is an ancestral religion common to the population living in the west African coastal corridor covering the countries mentioned above. The deities comprise of the supreme god and intermediary gods who cover different domain of life. The supreme god is known as ‘Mawu’, a benevolent god who has the control of the whole universe. The Vodun religion in its encounter with imported religions was associated to a demonic religion and continues to lose membership due to the westernization of the region. The contemporary Vodun religion evolves in an environment where most members practice syncretism with Islam and Christianism and most members are secretive in their allegiance to the Vodun gods.
For contemporary Vodun worshippers, the supreme god Mawu is most of the time assimilated to a monotheist god. Depending on the tribe, Mawu is either a female or a male or both. Mawu plays a moderator role in that all the intermediary gods’ actions are controlled. Below Mawu, there are seven intermediary divinities. These intermediary gods are active in everyday life and play a role in their domain. Sakpata is the god of the Earth. Hêbioso is the thunder god. Agbe is known as the god of the sea. Gû represents the god of war. Agê is in the domain of agriculture. Finally, Lêgba is the unpredictable god and serves as the contact point with the other gods. The ambivalence of modern worshippers is mostly visible in the rituals and sacrifices made to these gods in order to change the course of life in the changed world. Though some of Vodun priests can be found in the inner cities, the majority are located in rural area reinforcing the mystery and secrecy that surround them and their practitioners. Blood sacrifices, incantations, rituals, and the confinement of children and women in Vodun convents are some of the practices of this religion. 
Contemporary Vodun practitioners have adapted their religion to their time. With the introduction of monotheist religions, Vodun was predicted to disappear. Instead, Vodun continues to survive and has expanded to the diaspora where the Vodun has become an identity issue for former African slaves’ descendants in the Caribbean islands and the Americas. Even in contemporary West Africa, Vodun is used to affirm the African identity of its members in comparison to African Muslims and Christians.",-1960,2022,1071,744,Azizou Atte oudeyi,2020-07-23 04:06:38.102 +0200,2022-05-08 00:53:49.335 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
886,Pushtimarg (The Path of Grace) in the UK and Gujarat,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pushtimarg was developed by Vallabhacarya (1479–1531 CE), a Vedic philosopher who emphasised the Bhagavad Purana (a religious text of Hinduism). As a form of North Indian bhakti (devotion), the sampradaya follows Krishna as Shrinathji (as well as his other forms though focus is on his childhood). Vallabhacarya did not preach a life of asceticism or renunciation. His monistic philosophy was called Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism) where the focus is on the Supreme Being as personal, with the potential of developing a relationship. The Pushtimarg is a householder sampradaya (community) and therefore generating wealth and having a family are important parts of Krishna's world that he created for his lila (play). 

Historically, the popularity of the bhakti movement in India was twofold; “One the one hand, bhakti bypassed the hierarchy and ritualism of the Vedic sacrifices, monopolised by Brahmans and sponsored by their wealthy twice-born patrons, by teaching that salvation was open to all, regardless of caste, wealth, or sex, through the sincere and spontaneous expression of love for the divine. On the other hand, bhakti provided a more practicable alternative to the disciplined path followed by the renouncer” (Bennett 1993; 2). 

The community is dispersed globally, from Mozambique to Australia. In the 1990s, Pushtimarg gurus (who are called goswamis and are descendants of Vallabhacharya)  began to travel more frequently to the diasporas around the US and Europe though this trend came relatively late compared to other forms of North Indian Krishna worship (e.g. Hare Krishna or ISKCON and the Swaminarayan faith).",1990,2020,1042,779,Anishka Gheewala Lohiya,2020-07-23 10:10:41.156 +0200,2023-04-08 21:03:34.159 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
887,Postsocialist Mongolian Shamanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Shamanism has co-existed with Buddhism for many centuries in the Mongolian cultural region. Shamanic practices pre-date the arrival of Buddhism in the region which first became a state religion during the reign of Chinggis Khan’s grandson Khubilai Khan (r. 1260–1294). Shamanic practices and shamans have been the subject of religious oppression both by Buddhist institutions and more recently during the socialist period (1921-1990). Since the Democratic Revolution of 1989-1990, shamanism is once again allowed to be practiced in the public sphere. Since 1990 there has been a significant increase in the number of shamans and shamanic ceremonies in Mongolia. Shamanism in Mongolia differs from shamanism further north in Siberia due to the types of spirits that are channelled. Siberian shamans religious practices tend to be more animistic, channelling spirits as anthropologist Morten Pedersen puts it, ‘horizontally’. Mongolian shamans, on the other hand, channel ancestor spirits ‘vertically’. These are human spirits located within social hierarchies. Mongolian shamans typically communicate with an allied spirit or an ‘ongon’ who are the spirits of deceased human beings, generally within the shaman’s family. These spirits are historically located, reflecting specific genealogies. The presence of other spirits in the landscape is accepted by shamans, however it is not generally the focus of their ritual practice. Novice shamans are often found during shamanic ceremonies. Shamans can be recruited through extensive illnesses for which no cure can be found or other difficulties. Some men can become trapped in a semi-shamanic like state characterised by aggression and alcoholism which is known as ‘agsan’. Once a shaman establishes a relationship with an ongon they should carry out regular ceremonies and ritual offerings to maintain the relationship. Shamanic spirits don’t tend to provide eschatological or ontological answers, rather they provide advice for success in this life. Mongolian shamans enter a trance state without the use of drugs. They wear heavy clothing and a corded mask. Drumming and dancing is part of the trance state. Some shamans identify as yellow shamans as their practices include Buddhist elements.",1990,2020,1043,751,Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,2020-07-23 12:49:33.516 +0200,2020-07-25 09:59:40.904 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
888,Céli Dé monks,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian monastic communities of strict observance, characterised by Sabbatarianism, concerns for ritual purity, constant spiritual surveillance, and a strong sense of in-group distinctiveness in the face of other laxer communities. In general, the term refers to communities influenced by the teachings of saint Máel Ruain, abbot of Tallaght, Co. Dublin (obit 792). From Tallaght, four written sources are extant: the Old Irish Penitential, the Martyrology of Tallaght, the Martyrology of Óengus, the Stowe Missal and possibly a hymn in honour of Saint Michael. Additionally, it is likely the Old Irish Table of Penitential Commutations emerged from Tallaght as well, as a complement to the Penitential. From Terryglass (Co. Tipperry), a community headed by Máel Ruain’s disciple Máel Díthruib, is extant the so-called “Tallaght Memoir” (in three recensions: the “Monastery of Tallaght,” the Rule of the Céli Dé, and the Teaching of Máel Ruain). An array of other sources may have been influenced by or relevant to the Céli Dé movement (especially, the poems of Blathmac Mac Con Brettan and the Rule of Fothad).   It is unclear whether the different settlements were united in a sort of monastic federation or were independent bodies sharing a common spirituality. The number of the communities is also unclear: the membership of Terryglass is quite certain, as are those of the monastic houses mentioned in the ""Lucht Óentad Maíle Ruain"" (in Leinster and East Munster). The term Céle Dé (while consolidated in academia) is somewhat misleading, as it was employed by religious individuals without Máel Ruain's tradition too. Apparently, they called themselves ""maic bethad"" (Sons of Life) more often than ""Céli Dé"" (Clients or Companions of God). The group was constituted by monks (both ordained and not), nuns, para-monastic married tenants and at least some high-ranking members of the warrior aristocracy (such as Fedelmid mac Crimthainn, who became king of Cashel and over-king of Munster in the ninth century). The Céli Dé were characterised by their high regard for the Old Testament, which was expressed in their strict Sabbatarianism and their concern for ritual purity (sexual, alimentary and death-related taboos). They also enforced a complex and all-encompassing system of spiritual surveillance through detailed and frequent confession, called “anmchairdes” (soul-friendship). The Céle Dé have been studied quite deeply in the past centuries (mostly by Reeves, Hughes, O’Dwyer and Etchingham in the past). The most recent and throrough monograph is Westley Follett’s “Céli Dé in Ireland” (2007).",780,900,1044,749,Exequiel MongeAllen,2020-07-23 17:45:24.016 +0200,2020-07-25 20:29:57.291 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
891,Peruvian Mormons,43,Religious Group (v6),"Peruvian Mormons identify as members of the largest sect of Mormonism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They identify as Peruvian either because they were born in Peru or because one or more of their parents or grandparents were. Peru is a highly diasporic nation, and though most Peruvian Mormons live in Peru, many live in the U.S. state of Utah where their church is headquartered. There may be Peruvians who identify as members of sects of Mormonism other than The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, however, none of the participants in the principal anthropological study from whence this data set emerges identify with these sects nor do they know of any Peruvians who do. Importantly, most Peruvian Mormons do not identify as “Peruvian Mormons.” This is partially because their church, on August 16, 2018, expressly directed its membership to eschew the “Mormon” moniker from self-identification, but mostly because the general membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints desires to be seen as a global fellowship, not as a set of nationally situated religions with local, syncretic practices. Designating Mormons who happen to also be Peruvian, “Peruvian Mormons” is part of a theoretical intervention that separates the Mormonism happening among Peruvian Mormons in Peru and Utah from the sorts of Mormonism happening among the people Peruvians call ""Anglos"" in order to highlight the unique challenges Peruvians face in navigating a decidedly non-Peruvian organization that was founded upon early colonial U.S. (Anglo) conceptions of race and kinship.",1956,2020,1047,783,Jason Palmer,2020-07-23 22:09:02.836 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:09.536 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
892,Charismatic Renewal Movement in Christianity - Second Wave Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"For the first six decades of the 20th Century, Pentecostalism was viewed with skepticism and often outright dismissed by other denominations of Christianity. Many Christians believed Pentecostals to chaotic and disorderly. Pentecostal practices of speaking in tongues, their beliefs in divine healing and prophecy, and their unorganized and noisy prayer gatherings ostracized them from other established Protestant traditions believed to be more orderly and respectable. They were seen as a fringe group that stood outside of the traditions of mainline and evangelical branches of the larger Protestant community.  

However, Pentecostalism and a majority of the Christian communities in the United States would undergo a massive shift as Pentecostal theology and practices burst into the “orderly” worlds of mainline denominations and swept across denominational boundaries beginning in 1960.  In a small Episcopalian perish in Van Nuys, CA in April 1960, the charismatic renewal found its genesis when Reverend Dennis Bennett shared his experience of being baptized in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. His announcement angered his congregation and he was asked to resign shortly after sharing his experiences. 

Despite the parishioners of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church being told to not speak about what Reverend Bennett shared about, one parishioner was not going to be quiet. Jean Stone was a parishioner who began a media campaign to chronicle and share about Reverend Bennett’s experience.  Stone got Time Magazine and Newsweek to write articles about the renewal movement and Bennett became the defacto face of the Charismatic Renewal movement in the United States. As Bennett’s story spread throughout the country, other clergy from mainline Protestant denominations began to share about their experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Methodists, Lutherans, Baptists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Mennonites, Roman Catholics, and others began to open up about their Pentecostal experience and many began to practice speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing, and deliverance.

Although there is an overlap between some of the beliefs between Pentecostals and Charismatics, there are some key differences. Both groups believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is an experience that often takes place after conversion (although some adherents experience the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at their conversion). A key difference is the evidence of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals believe that a person must speak in tongues in order to demonstrate that they have been baptized in the Spirit. Charismatics claim that although many people do speak in tongues as their first sign, it is not the only sign that accompanies being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Any manifestations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit outlined in the New Testament are recognized by Charismatics as being baptized in the Spirit.  

The Charismatic Renewal Movement validated Historical Pentecostal churches and movements as part of the American Christian landscape. Prior to the movement, Mainline and Protestant denominations viewed Pentecostalism with disdain and were weary of their theology and practices. However, the media coverage of Reverend Dennis Bennett’s experiences in California in 1960, as well as the rise in denominational clergy sharing about their own experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit, led mainline denominational leaders were to address the Charismatic renewal movements taking place in their churches.  Most of these denominations ultimately accepted Charismatic adherents as part of their tradition. Other denominations left their position on the charismatic renewal movement open without rejecting the movement outright.",1960,2020,1018,762,Nathan Womack,2020-07-24 00:12:00.075 +0200,2020-08-11 00:30:30.510 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
893,Sethian Gnostic,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sethian gnostics – also referred to by scholars as “classic gnostics” or simply “the gnostics” – represent a sect within early Christianity that existed from the second through the fourth century CE. Most of what we know about this group derives from the discovery of the Nag Hammadi collection of Coptic manuscripts, which dates to around 350 CE, but this information is supplemented by various heresiological writings by early proto-orthodox theologians, most significantly Irenaeus, who wrote around 180 CE. The name Sethian is applied to the sect by modern scholars because of its self-identification with the biblical Seth, son of Adam. “Gnostics” comes from the Greek word gnōstikoi (roughly, “those who know”), which some scholars consider to be a label the Sethians applied to themselves.

Social information about the Sethians must be inferred from the textual evidence, which contains a number of features used to characterize them: (1) a complex cosmogonic myth based in part on a creative revision of Genesis and Plato’s Timaeus, (2) a strong sense of group identity and in-group language as the “seed (or offspring) of Seth,” and (3) a ritual of baptism sometimes called a ritual of “five seals.” Very little is known of the daily life or organizational structure of the Sethians. They shared with other Christians certain theological traditions, some scripture, and an ascetic lifestyle.

Some features of the Sethian myth include: (1) an ineffable divine first principle called the Parent or Invisible Spirit; (2) a second principle called Barbelo; (3) a series of four luminaries, also called aeons or realms, named Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithai, and Eleleth; (4) the emanation of a number of additional aeons, the last of which is named Wisdom (Sophia in Greek); (5) a craftsman (dēmiourgos in Greek) named Ialdabaoth, who steals divine power from his mother (Wisdom) to create the visible cosmos based on intelligible paradigms while remaining ignorant of the divinities higher than him; (6) the creation of seven, twelve, and/or 365 rulers of the material world who themselves create human beings and the remainder of the material world; (7) a dramatic struggle resulting in some of humanity being given Ialdabaoth’s pilfered power as a spark of divinity; (8) these human beings are the offspring of Seth, sealed by a special baptismal ritual, while the offspring of Cain remain under the power of the ignorant demiurge and his minions. (9) Where the human Jesus appears in the versions of this myth, he is variously identified with a preexistent Anointed One (Greek christos), a preexistent Word (Greek logos), a preexistent Seth, or Barbelo.
Individual Sethian texts contain some but not all of the elements of this myth. As such, the category “Sethian Gnostic” can be understood as a polythetic class, i.e. it contains a number of non-essential characteristics but lacks an essential (sine qua non) characteristic. Some scholars, notably John D. Turner, have reconstructed a “literary history” of these texts based on textual developments within this mythic framework. The complex emanation scheme of the Sethian myth reveals an involvement with the Middle Platonic philosophical speculation of the time, which has been compared to such thinkers as Philo of Alexandria and Numenius of Apamea.",100,400,1048,778,Brian Alt,2020-07-24 00:29:36.567 +0200,2020-07-24 00:29:36.567 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
894,Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches,43,Religious Group (v6),"The UFMCC (often shortened to “MCC”) is a Christian denomination that was founded first and foremost as a ministry for LGBTQ people. Reverend Troy Perry, who grew up in rural Florida and worked as a pastor in Baptist and Pentecostal churches before coming out as gay, launched the initial congregation in his Los Angeles living room in 1968. When the denomination was officially established in 1970, there were a handful of congregations, spanning several states. By 1972, there were 35 congregations in 19 states. Today, the MCC consists of over 200 congregations in over 30 countries around the world (although this entry focuses on the U.S. and Canada).

Perry served as Moderator (the denomination’s head) until 2005, and since then there have been three Moderators. Rev. Elder Cecilia Eggleston was elected Moderator in 2019. Every three years, all MCC ministers and selected members gather for General Conference, where the Moderator and the Governing Board (administrative leadership) are elected.

Individual congregations maintain a great deal of autonomy over their worship practices, and thus there is a wide variety of worship styles in the MCC. Many churches blend charismatic and more formal influences. One of the few denomination-wide requirements for worship is that every congregation offer Holy Communion at weekly services.

The theologically diverse denomination defies easy labels of ""conservative"" and “liberal.” For decades, the denomination’s doctrinal statements proudly proclaimed that the MCC “moved in the mainstream of Christianity,” which they defined by the Apostles’ and Nicene creeds. Additionally, these doctrinal statements made what most would deem to be orthodox Protestant affirmations, such as “All men are justified to God through Faith” and “the Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God.” 

In the twenty-first century, however, the denomination's official proclamations of doctrine have become less insistently “orthodox.” Even as the personal theologies of many MCC ministers and members continue to resemble “orthodox Protestant” beliefs, the denomination’s Statement of Faith now includes proclamations like “We don't all believe exactly the same things” and “We are part of an ongoing conversation on matters of belief and faith, shaped by scripture and the historic creeds” (with no attendant declaration of the scripture’s divine inspiration). 

If there is one unifying theological theme across the MCC, from its inception to the present, it is the belief that support for LGBTQ equality is an outgrowth of authentic Christian faith, which is “grounded in God's radically inclusive love for all people” (as the current Statement of Faith puts it). In recent years, what began as the church’s focus on equality for “homosexuals” has expanded, at least in many of the denomination’s circles, to include a focus on social justice issues more broadly.",1968,2020,1049,785,William Stell,2020-07-24 00:32:51.624 +0200,2020-08-16 22:19:01.702 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
896,Sannō Shintō,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sannō shintō refers to narratives, doctrinal analyses and artistic depictions related to the “mountain sovereigns” (jp. Sannō), the deities of the Hie shrine, now Hiyoshi taisha, in Sakamoto at the foothills of Mount Hiei. 
In Sannō shintō, the identity of the Hie deities is chiefly conceptualised with the vocabulary and semiotic framework of Tendai Buddhism, and in special (but not exclusive) relation to the lineages residing at the Enryakuji on Mount Hiei, to this day the main Tendai centre in Japan. While the first extant sources relating the Hie deities to the Enryakuji date back to the ninth century, Sannō shintō reached its apex as a discourse in the middle ages (12th-15th century), throughout which the majority of the material extensively treating the identities of the deities was collected.
More concretely, Sannō shintō can be defined in two ways. In a narrow sense, it only indicates discourses produced at the Enryakuji, mostly mythological and doctrinal, which establish correspondences between the deities of Hie and specific Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Although Sannō is a collective term for the whole host of deities enshrined in the twenty-one shrines of Hie, most often the “mountain sovereigns” are three of them: Ōmiya, presiding over the western compound of the shrines; Ninomiya, presiding over the eastern, and Shōshinji, also a deity of the western compound. In the “strict” definition of Sannō shintō, these are considered as emanations of, or identical to, three Buddhas: Śākyamuni, the main Buddha of the Western pagoda area of the Enryakuji (saitō), Yakushi (sskr. Bhaiṣajyaguru), presiding over the Konpon chudo in the Eastern pagoda area, and Amida (sskr. Amitabha), presiding over the Yokawa area. Such correspondences are sanctioned by monastic treatises such as the Keiranshūyōshū (14th century).
At a broader level, however, we can say that Sannō shintō is also made up of discourses on the deities of Hie that do not quite befit the narrow interpretation. For instance, these might be mythological accounts produced at the Hie shrine, touching upon subjects such as the origin and enshrinement of the deities; accounts of the festival held each year for the deities, as well as monastic discourses which do not quite conceptualise the deities within the same correspondences of the narrow definition. In this entry I shall adopt the broader definition for three reasons. Firstly, because the medieval Hie shrines and Enryakuji were closely intertwined from an institutional point of view. Secondly, because the correspondences of the narrow definition do not represent the full extent of the diachronic evolution of Sannō shintō. Thirdly, because the “narrow” definition of Sannō shintō presupposes the “broader” one, especially from a mythological perspective. Thirdly, because textual material that presents the correspondences of the “narrow” version of Sannō shintō often also includes accounts produced not by monastics, but by priestly lineages at the shrines. Such is the case for two of the the texts which are considered synonymous with Sannō shintō, Yōtenki (13-15th century) and Sange Yōryakki (13th century).
Taking account of this, in consulting this entry one should keep in mind at all times that Sannō shintō was not a conscious religious group, but a discursive field comprising various mythologies, ritual and devotional aspects, all joined together by being centred on the same deities and the same place. 
Please note that this article focuses on the medieval discourse on the Hie deities, but not on Sannō ichijutsu shintō, the pre-modern discourse issued from Sannō shintō but focused on the Tōshōgū, in Nikko.",800,1571,1050,787,Emanuela Sala,2020-07-24 09:53:43.566 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:20.497 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
897,Gaengjeongyudo,43,Religious Group (v6),"Gaengjeongyudo is a Korean new religion founded by Kang Daeseong in during the colonial period. Kang, whose religious name is Yeongsindang, was born in 1890 in North Jeolla province. After years of spiritual practice which was also accompanied by his wife and son, Yeongsindang attained a form of spiritual awakening, or enlightment, after which he began to display supernatural and prophetic abilities, and gain disciples. The object of faith in Gaengjeongyudo is an astrological diagram called Seondanggung, which is composed of elements such as the East and the West, the Yin and the Yang, and 24 seasons and periods. At the core of Gaengjeongyudo’s tenets is the notion that the three traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and ‘Seon’ (native Korean belief of spirituality and heaven) should be harmonised. It is believed that we are currently living through a time of great change in the universal order, and the questions and answers concerning the future vision are contained in detail in Bueunggyeong, the core scripture written by the founder himself. Followers of Gaengjeongyudo are best known for their traditionalist way of living, and although the membership has significantly declined over the years, many of the followers still reside in Cheonghakdong, maintaining their distinctive lifestyle. Although Gaengjeongyudo is often categorised as a Confucianism-based new religious movement due to the name and distinct traditionalist outlook, such classification is highly disputable. While elements of Confucianism can be found especially from the adherence to Confucian virtues such as loyalty and filial piety, incorporation of Confucian elements in varying extent is in fact a very common characteristic to most native Korean new religions of syncretic nature. Based on the unique scriptures, religious symbols and distinct objects of faith, Gaengjeongyudo is distinguished from Confucianism-based movements such as Daedonggyo and Gonggyo, which placed great emphasis on classical Confucian texts and philosophy.",1928,2020,717,781,Yeonju Lee,2020-07-24 11:50:35.920 +0200,2020-08-03 23:17:58.655 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
898,Rastafari of Jamaica,43,Religious Group (v6),"As some Rastafari do not consider themselves a 'religious' group (as Western academic/theological discourse might describe it), the term 'livity' or ‘movement’ is more frequently employed to describe this Afrocentric belief system primarily composed of Afro-Caribbean adherents and those in the Afro-Caribbean diaspora. The Rastafari movement comprises a syncretic belief system combing Judeo-Christian tradition and imagery, African derived Jamaican peasant culture and spirituality, and a fierce political opposition to oppression and separation in favour of love and unity.  

Variation of practices, specific beliefs and spiritual influences, understood within Rastafari as ‘livity’, are broad within a movement which is deeply anti-hierarchical and which has no central spiritually authoritative body. The movement is however orientated around attestation to the divine, divinely inspired or personally inspirational nature of His Imperial Majesty (HIM) Haile Selassie I (pre-regnal name Ras Tafari), Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-1974. Largely a monotheistic movement, adherents refer to the divine creator (sometimes interpreted as HIM) as ‘Jah’, an interpreted rendering of ‘Jehovah’. 

Haile Selassie became a figure of anti-colonial resistance and black assertiveness in colonised communities across the world after his coronation in 1930 which some saw as fulfilment of prophecy foretold by black nationalist Marcus Garvey of a black king who would lead black populations out of oppression and towards glory. Garvey himself built much of his rhetoric of black self-determination around Biblical sentiments, particularly Biblical allusions to 'Ethiopia' (esp. Psalms 68:31) which was interpreted broadly to refer to Africa as a whole. Ethiopia had also gained a reputation as the only non-colonised sovereign state on the continent of Africa having previously defeated Italian imperialists (most significantly at the Battle of Adowa 1896, a date commemorated by Rastafari annually). Haile Selassie then came to embody an anti-imperialist and anti-oppressive struggle many in the Caribbean were experiencing, and become the central focus of a new movement. This led many in the movement both in it’s formation and today to yearn towards a repatriation to the ‘motherland’ of Africa, or more specifically for some to Ethiopia and to Shashamane where Haile Selassie donated land for the repatriative efforts of those in the diaspora. 

The notions here of resistance to oppression and injustice underpin Rastafari cosmologies and interactions with the world today. Rastafari frequently denounce the wickedness of ‘Babylon’ in contrast to ‘Zion’. ‘Babylon’ offers an interpretation of the industrial, colonial and post- colonial, Western reality as a subjugation of humanity in an existence defined by oppression and suffering. Conversely, the most divine locality of Zion represents a beacon of hope, freedom and a physical and spiritual repatriation to the place of The Almighty.

An equally core element of Rastafari belief is an emphasis on the natural and the primordial in recognition that that which is most natural on this earth is most in accord with Jah’s original design for creation. This is conceptualised as ‘ital’ (from vital), a broad philosophical and ethical concept embodying a striving towards all in its most natural form. 

As some Rastafari do not consider themselves a 'religious' group (as Western academic/theological discourse might describe it), the term ‘movement’ is more frequently employed to describe this Afrocentric belief system primarily composed of Afro-Caribbean adherents and those in the Afro-Caribbean diaspora. The Rastafari movement comprises a syncretic belief system combing Judeo-Christian tradition and imagery, African derived Jamaican peasant culture and spirituality, and a fierce political opposition to oppression and separation in favour of love and unity.  

Variation of practices, specific beliefs and spiritual influences, understood within Rastafari as ‘livity’, are broad within a movement which is deeply anti-hierarchical, heterogenous and which has no central spiritually authoritative body. The movement is however orientated around attestation to the divine, divinely inspired or personally inspirational nature of His Imperial Majesty (HIM) Haile Selassie I (pre-regnal name Ras Tafari), Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-1974. Largely a monotheistic movement, adherents refer to the divine creator (sometimes interpreted as HIM) as ‘Jah’, an interpreted rendering of ‘Jehovah’. 

Haile Selassie became a figure of anti-colonial resistance and black assertiveness in colonised communities across the world after his coronation in 1930 which some saw as fulfilment of prophecy foretold by black nationalist Marcus Garvey of a black king who would lead black populations out of oppression and towards glory. Garvey himself built much of his rhetoric of black self-determination around Biblical sentiments, particularly Biblical allusions to 'Ethiopia' (esp. Psalms 68:31) which was interpreted broadly to refer to Africa as a whole. Ethiopia had also gained a reputation as the only non-colonised sovereign state on the continent of Africa having previously defeated Italian imperialists (most significantly at the Battle of Adowa 1896, a date commemorated by Rastafari annually). Haile Selassie then came to embody an anti-imperialist and anti-oppressive struggle many in the Caribbean were experiencing, and become the central focus of a new movement. This led many in the movement both in it’s formation and today to yearn towards a repatriation to the ‘motherland’ of Africa, or more specifically for some to Ethiopia and to Shashamane where Haile Selassie donated land for the repatriative efforts of those in the diaspora. 

The notions here of resistance to oppression and injustice underpin Rastafari cosmologies and interactions with the world today. Rastafari frequently denounce the wickedness of ‘Babylon’ in contrast to ‘Zion’. ‘Babylon’ offers an interpretation of the industrial, colonial and post- colonial, Western reality as a subjugation of humanity in an existence defined by oppression and suffering. Conversely, the most divine locality of Zion represents a beacon of hope, freedom and a physical and spiritual repatriation to the place of The Almighty.

An equally core element of Rastafari belief is an emphasis on the natural and the primordial in recognition that that which is most natural on this earth is most in accord with Jah’s original design for creation. This is conceptualised as ‘ital’ (from vital), a broad philosophical and ethical concept embodying a striving towards all in its most natural form. 

Rastafari are also frequently categorised and stereotyped in Western society for their use of ganja (cannabis), their dreadlocked hair and their involvement in reggae music. This view is however rudimentary and narrow, failing to grasp the theological and spiritual depth of this movement. 

Early Rastafari, and indeed some still today, grounded this divine assessment of His Majesty Biblically, referring to him under the titles of 'King of Kings, Lord of Lords', 'Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah',",1930,2020,1067,769,Joseph Powell,2020-07-24 12:27:43.203 +0200,2022-11-22 00:37:09.369 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
899,Nahdlatul Ulama (NU),43,Religious Group (v6),"Nahdlatul Ulama is an Islamic mass organization in Indonesia. The organization was founded in 1926 by Hasyim Asyari in Surabaya, East Java, in response to the increasing presence of modernist Islam in the Dutch East Indies and the institutional force of Muhammadiyah, a modernist Islamic mass organization. The stated goal of the organization was to defend the interests and values of the scholars of traditionalist Sunni Islam, Ash'ari theology, and the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. 

Although the organization has a central leadership, there are many additional centers of authority underneath this top level, including provincial and regional branches and autonomous affiliated organizations for certain groups (e.g. women, youth, students). The beating heart of the organization is the network of traditionalist Islamic schools called (pesantren), where the future leaders and scholars of the organization are educated. Through the extensive pesantren network, the organization is able to reach and recruit constituents in a widely dispersed geographic area. The kyai or leaders of these pesantren are furthermore authoritative figures in their respective communities that exceeds the education of youth. 

The organization has undergone multiple shifts in its almost century-long history. During the last years of Dutch colonial rule and the Japanese occupation (1942-45), Nahdlatul Ulama became politically active. After independence, Nahdlatul Ulama and the modernist Islamic mass organization Muhammadiyah worked together in a political party, Masyumi, representing the interests of Indonesian Muslims; but due to internal conflicts, Nahdlatul Ulama withdrew from Masyumi in 1952 and founded their own political party. The organization remained active in party politics until 1984. Since this time, it has not been directly involved in party politics. 

Since the fall of the New Order in 1998, Nahdlatul Ulama has taken an active role in the formation in what they consider a tolerant, civil, and moderate Islam. In 1999, the renowned former chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Abdurrahman Wahid (more commonly known as Gus Dur) became the first democratically elected president of Reformation Era Indonesia. While his tenure as president was only two years long, his vision for the organization and the relation between the country and Islam continues to shape the organization until today. Gus Dur is held up as a hallmark of a friendly, accommodating, and tolerant Islam. Since 2015, this vision of a moderate Islam has become known within Nahdlatul Ulama as ‘Islam Nusantara,’ the Islam of the Indonesian world, a term which points to the organization’s commitment to embracing local culture, to coexisting peacefully with others, and to being an bulwark against radical Islamic influence.",1926,2020,1053,735,Verena Meyer,2020-07-26 22:02:17.972 +0200,2020-07-27 22:40:45.838 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
900,Pharisees,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Pharisees are an early Jewish sect dating from the late Hellenistic period to the end of the first century CE. Our primary evidence for this group derives from the Jewish historian Josephus (d. ca 100 CE), early Christian literature, and the later Tannaitic literature. According to Josephus (War 2.8; Ant. 13.5.9; 13.10.6; 18.1.2-6), the Pharisees are one of three ""philosophical sects"" of the Jews, who ""are friendly to one another, and are for the exercise of concord, and regard for the public"" (War 2.8.14; trans. Whiston). The group appears to have formed sometime during the Hasmonean period (ca. 140 BCE) as an influential party among a majority of the Jewish people. As a political entity, they appear to have gained popularity in response to the Sadducees and the Hasmonean High Priest John Hyrcanus, securing political leverage under Salome Alexandra. 

The Gospel sources offer a polemical portrayal of the Pharisees at odds with the early Jesus movement (Matthew 23:1-39), often engaging in ritualistic dispute with Jesus and his disciples (Mark 7:1-23). In other early Christian sources, the apostle Paul identifies himself with the Pharisees (Acts 22:3; 23:6; Philippians 3:5; Galatians 1:14), and elsewhere, is depicted as actively persecuting members of the early Jesus movement (Acts 8:1-3). In these sources, a positive portrayal of the Pharisees may be found in the figure of Gamaliel (Acts 5:34-42), who persuades the Sanhedrin to show mercy to followers of Jesus. 

The term Pharisee may derive from the Hebrew word ""to separate"" (perushim); however, this etymology has been recently questioned (Rivkin, ""Who Were the Pharisees?""). The sectarian boundaries of the Pharisees were determined by a commitment to food and purity rituals laid out in Oral (e.g., ""tradition of the fathers"") and Written (e.g., the Torah) traditions. Their belief system consists of monotheism, an afterlife (of both reward and punishment), the immortality of the soul (especially in contrast to the Sadducees), and resurrection for the righteous. In the literary evidence, Pharisees are often characterized as the leading experts in interpreting the law and, according to Josephus, less stringent in rendering punitive judgement than the Sadducees.",-150,70,485,771,M.

902,British Isles: Christian,43,Religious Group (v6),"A description of the British Isles after the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Created by Nicole Volmering. Nicole Volmering is a postdoctoral researcher specialising in the medieval religious literature and history of the insular world. Her research interests include monasticism, eschatology, martyrologies, and the history of the book. She holds a PhD in Early and Medieval Irish from University College Cork, which won the Johann Kaspar Zeuß prize, as well as a MA in English (track Old English). She is editor of the forthcoming Martyrologies in the Insular World. Context: The ‘British Isles’ in this document refers primarily to the area of Great Britain south of Hadrian’s wall.
Note: The gradual Christianization of Britain in this period was not a homogeneous or coherent process. The British Church appears to have a well-integrated provincial hierarchy in the fourth century: our earliest documentary evidence is the presence of British bishops at the Council of Arles in 314 CE. Yet its continuation is shadowy until the sixth century. Christianity retained a stronger foothold in the Western and some northern parts, while it may have declined in the East under pressure of Germanic raids and settlements by the end of the period. Just across the northern border however the Picts also appear to adopted (and abandoned) Christianity, while St Patrick brought it across the water to Ireland. The “re-conversions” of Anglo-Saxon peoples belong to the sixth century.",300,500,992,618,Ryan Johnson,2020-07-28 01:37:27.076 +0200,2020-07-28 01:37:27.076 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
903,The Buddhist community on Mount Lu during early medieval China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Mount Lu (Lu Shan 廬山), located in present-day Jiangxi province of China, rose to become an important center of Buddhist scholarship and practice in early medieval China under the leadership of the scholar-monk Huiyuan 慧遠 (334 CE–416 CE). 

Huiyuan came to Mount Lu with his disciples, associates, and his brother Huichi 慧持 (337–412) in 381 CE following the disintegration of the monastic community of Xiangyang 襄陽during the war between the Former Qin (Qian Qin 前秦; 351–394) and the Eastern Jin (Dong Jing 東晉; 317–420). With the help of his former colleague Huiyong 慧永 (332–414), who had settled on the mountain a few years earlier, and the financial support from the local governor Huan Yi 桓伊 (d.u.; Governor of Jiangzhou 江州 since 384), Huiyuan’s community soon grew into one of the most important centers of Buddhism in South China. 

The community drew such influential Buddhist scholar-monks of the time as Huiguan 慧觀 (d.u.), Huirui 慧叡 (d.u.), and Daosheng 道生 (355–434), as well as such lay intellectuals of renown as Zhou Xuzhi 周續之 (d. 423), Liu Yimin 劉遺民 (354–410), Lei Cizong 雷次宗 (386–448), and Zong Bing 宗炳 (375–443).

Mount Lu also was the site of a few important translation workshops during this time. In the early 390s, Saṅghadeva (fl. 383–397) translated two important Abhidharma texts, the _Apitan xin lun_ 阿毘曇心論 (T 1550) and the _San fadu lun_ 三法度論 (T 1506), and in the early 410s, Buddhabhadra (359–429) translated the meditation text _Damoduoluo chan jing_ 達摩多羅禪經 (T 618).

In this animated intellectual environment, Huiyuan authored such representative Buddhist treatises of the time as the _Shamen bujing wangzhe lun_ 沙門不敬王者論 and the _Ming baoying lun_ 明報應論, where he articulated his theory of the imperishability of the soul (_shen bumie_ 神不滅) that was to exert lasting influence on Chinese Buddhists' understanding of the mind.

In terms of Buddhist practice, the Buddhist community of Mount Lu is where some of the earliest examples of the cult of Amitabha and the belief in the rebirth in Amitabha’s Western Pure Land are associated with. For example, in 402, the 123 members community took a collective vow to be reborn in the Western Pure Land before a statue of Amitabha Buddha. 

Another important example of Buddhist art created by this group was the Buddha-image (Foying 佛影) Grotto. The renowned grotto was constructed in 413 relying on the oral reports about the Buddha-image cave of the Indian city of Nagarahāra and enshrined a painting of the Buddha, whose excellence in turn inspired its own copies to be made and circulated.

In this way, the Buddhist community of Mount Lu during early medieval China developed a rich and lively religious culture involving scholarship, devotionalism, and art and architecture.",350,450,1055,791,Sangyop Lee,2020-07-28 01:59:43.447 +0200,2022-04-10 23:07:50.197 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

906,The Church of England,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Church of England is the established church of the nation of England and has its origin in Henry VIII's break from Rome in 1534. The so-called 'Elizabethan Settlement' was an attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to find a via media between the radical Protestantism of the Puritan movement and the excesses of Roman Catholicism. As such, under Queen Elizabeth, the Church of England established its identity as Reformed and Catholic: 'Reformed' in the sense that it identified its theological authority not primarily in the traditions of the Church but in Scripture, and 'Catholic' in the sense that it retained such Catholic traits as an emphasis upon the apostolic succession of bishops, the sacramental identity of the Church, a formal liturgical character, and the Church's continuity with the Medieval and Patristic past.
In the modern period (here demarcated as beginning in 1963 with the publication of the significant work of liberal theology 'Honest to God', by the then Bishop of Woolwich John Robinson), the Church of England's identity and sources of authority are contested. Although its sources of doctrine and practice are still formally codified in Canon Law as deriving from Scripture and its historical formularies - the Book of Common Prayer, the 1662 Ordinal, and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion - there is wide divergence of opinion as to how this is to be understood.
The current 'parties' in the Church of England can be divided into three: Evangelical, Catholic and Liberal. Evangelicals emphasize the Reformed heritage of the Church of England and note the authority of Scripture. Catholics stress the importance of the Church's sacraments, its links to the Medieval and Patristic past, and its relationship with other episcopally led churches such as the Roman Catholic Church. Liberals highlight the role of reason in the interpretation of Scripture and the historic formularies. The existence of these different 'traditions' within the Church of England results in a sense of its contested identity: doctrine, belief and practice often vary dramatically from church to church. Its unifying feature must be said therefore to be the institutional structure focussed on the ecclesiastical hierarchy - archbishops, bishops, priests etc. - and the centralized and diocesan adminstrations which oversee parishes and other institutions within the Church.",1963,2020,725,793,Jamie Franklin,2020-07-28 11:33:10.109 +0200,2020-08-05 17:05:20.676 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
908,Sino-Christian Theology,43,Religious Group (v6),"“Sino-Christian Theology” designates an academic, cultural, and theological movement that began in mainland China during the 1980’s, and that later developed in other Sinophone areas like Hong Kong and (to a lesser extent) Taiwan. Distinct from the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), and the substantial evangelical, charismatic, and Neo-Calvinist movements, it represents a small, possibly waning, but altogether unique expression of Christianity in postsocialist China.  ¶  The term “Sino-Christian Theology” translates hanyu jidu shenxue, which literally means “Han-language Christian theology.” Most commonly, it refers to an intellectual wave inaugurated by the work of Liu Xiaofeng and He Guanghu, both professors at Renmin University who have since become quasi-canonized as its “church fathers.” While the movement has diversified over its decades-long development, three broad features remain. Sino-Christian Theology: is written in Chinese; emphasizes the contemporary situation; and prioritizes universities (rather than churches or seminaries) as the primary site for knowledge production.  ¶  Conventionally, Sino-Christian Theologians tend to be “Cultural Christians” (wenhua jidutu), i.e. Christians who do not profess “personal faith” in Christianity or who are not regular, church-going attendees. As far as the Chinese public and even most scholars are concerned, Sino-Christian Theology and Chinese Cultural Christianity are virtually synonymous. “China’s Apollos,” “China’s Nicodemus,” and “Scholars in Mainland China Studying Christianity” (SMSC) are other appellations that have been used to describe the movement.  ¶  Sino-Christian Theologians have tended to approach theology from within the disciplines of literature, philosophy, and various social sciences. Yang Huilin sees the movement as closer to Religious Studies than Theology (as conceived in the West), while Chloe Starr observes that Sino-Christian Theology constitutes a “theorizing of theology itself.”  ¶  There are three primary contexts in which Sino-Christian Theology has arisen. The first, as Fredrik Fallman observes, concerns the broader Chinese quest for modernity. Since China’s humiliating defeats by foreign imperialists during the so-called “Century of Humiliation”, Chinese intellectuals have labored to reform China and re-negotiate its place in the new global world order. Not unlike Republican-era Christians like Wu Leichuan and Zhao Zichen, Sino-Christian Theologians turn to Christian resources to address China’s ongoing aspirations to modernize. The second, following Starr, locates the movement within larger globalizing trends of the world-wide church. Alongside Black American, Korean Minjung, and various postcolonial theologies, Sino-Christian Theology represents the continuing Chinese attempt to forge a Christianity that does dialogical, liberational justice to contextual sociocultural realities. The post-Mao Reform Era constitutes the third context. The movement arose due to the relaxation of restrictions in virtually all spheres of life, whether economic, political, or religious. But despite this relative “opening up,” certain fundamental strictures of the state remain, whether in its official socialist-atheistic ideology or overarching materialist-economic aspirations. Nonetheless, it is precisely within these conditions – which have precipitated the much-discussed “values vacuum” of contemporary China – that Sino-Christian Theology performs its most creative and constructive work.",1980,2020,1119,794,Teng-Kuan Ng,2020-07-28 19:42:07.867 +0200,2021-09-29 20:34:35.309 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
910,Christian Base Community movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian Base Communities (in Spanish: Comunidades Eclesiales de Base or CEBs) spread across Latin America in the years following the CELAM Bishop's conference in Medellín, Colombia in 1968. Associated with the emergence of Latin American liberation theology, CEBs of the late 1960s began as community formation projects led by missionary nuns and priests in poor communities. Their model and method took inspiration from Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), the Second Vatical Council (1962 – 1965), from early Catholic Action programs, and from the social and political critiques that emerged among liberation movements across the region following the Cuban Revolution. Throughout the 1970s, CEBs became increasingly lay-led and developed into a powerful religious and political social movement. As such, while CEBs often formed larger regional or national organizations to facilitate communication and political mobilization, this movement was broadly grassroots, disaggregated, and pluralistic in theology, practice, and sense of purpose. Despite their significant diversity, Latin American CEBs shared common tendencies such as: lay leadership and greater lay participation in liturgical life, small community worship and organization, an emphasis on gender parity, a commitment to grassroots politics, a Marxist and liberation theology-informed social critique, and a spiritual educational model rooted in lay analysis of scripture applied to present, worldly concerns. CEBs continue to exist in many Latin American countries, though their prevalence and social influence declined markedly after the mid-1990s in most places.",1968,1998,1062,798,Brendan Jordan,2020-07-28 23:21:42.925 +0200,2020-07-29 09:00:49.322 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

912,Ganden Monastery (Dga' ldan),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Ganden Monastery was established in 1409 by Tsongkhapa Losang Drakpa (1357-1419), the founder of the Geluk tradition. At an altitude roughly 4075 meters above sea level, it is located some forty kilometers northeast of the city of Lhasa in the province of Ü in Central Tibet (today, the Chinese Dagzê District). Its full name is Drok Riwoché Ganden Nampar Gyelwé Ling, although it is also called Geden in accord with prophecies connecting its name to the syllable gé. Tibetan sources state that the term Geluk arose from the name Geden, with those at this monastery known as “upholders of the tradition of Geden” (dge ldan ring lugs ‘dzin pa). 

According to one prophecy, the monastery was conferred the name Ganden due to a prophecy that Tsongkhapa would be reborn in Tuṣita in his next life. Prophecies related to Ganden make up a major part of Tibetan historical accounts of the monastery, and describe elements such as its founder, location, certain sacred objects related to Ganden, and the qualities of its early hierarchs and their disciples. On a mundane level, Ganden was founded out of the consternation Tsongkhapa’s disciples had for their itinerant lifestyle, as well as concerns for Tsongkhapa’s well-being as he aged. 

Drok Ri or Nomad Mountain was chosen as the site of Ganden in accord with prophesies and divinations. It possesses numerous geomantic elements marking it as an auspicious abode; in particular, Ganden is famed for the presence of “self-arisen” forms, spontaneous natural phenomena that embody or evoke supernatural phenomena, as well as objects and events from the lives of Tsongkhapa and other influential figures. Situated along the circumambulation routes surrounding Ganden, these phenomena, along with Ganden’s major festivals, represent two of the monastery’s main attractions for lay devotees. 

During its phase of initial construction, Ganden consisted of a residence for Tsongkhapa, a general assembly-hall with a shrine, and living quarters for about seventy monks, with the foundations laid for one hundred more. Later, more structures were added, including Yangpachen Temple, a temple for Tsongkhapa's reliquary stupa, and buildings for the two main colleges of Ganden, Jangtsé and Shartsé. Also present are retreat-huts that belonged to Tsongkhapa and Khedrub Jé, and a printing house. All these structures contain numerous religious objects and murals. Perhaps the most sacred item is Tsongkhapa’s own reliquary stupa, which continues to attract devotees to the present day.",1409,1959,1063,763,Michael Ium,2020-07-29 06:31:07.128 +0200,2020-08-13 10:52:15.540 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
914,Tariqa Shadhiliyya,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Tariqa Shadhiliyya is a Sufi order dating back to the 13th Century CE.  It takes its name from Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili who was born in the Ghumara region of Morocco (1196) and died in Humaythara, Egypt (1258).  Originating in the milieu of the western Islamic world (Andalusia and al-Maghrib), the Shadhiliyya spread through North Africa (via Tunisia) and established a firm foundation in the Middle East as one of the prominent Sufi orders of the medieval and modern Muslim world.  Influences on the al-Shadhili included figures in this western Islamic world such as Abu Madyan (d. 1198), Abd al-Salam b. Mashish (d. 1227), and Ibn Arabi (d. 1240).  It also emerged in the political context of the Almohad revolt against the Almoravids, and therefore the emphasis of the former on the absolute unity of Allah (the principle of tawhid) became a component of al-Shadhili’s teachings, although it was filtered through Ibn Arabi’s conceptions of wahdat al-wujud (unity of existence).  While influenced by his contemporaries, al-Shadhili saw himself not as merely an inheritor but as the creator of a distinctive path (tariqa).  In the case of al-Shadhili, this path was passed on through specific prayers and formulaic sayings whose repetition is integral to the spiritual development of the disciple (e.g., hizb, dhikr, wird, du’a).  Although these core practices remain present, the attitude of continued reform embodied in al-Shadhili’s teaching and reflected in the common saying ‘A Sufi is a child of one’s time’ (al-sufi ibn waqtihi) allowed certain figures cast themselves (or are cast by others) as ‘renewers’ or ‘reformers,’ and these reform movements continue to give rise to new branches.

In line with many Sufi orders, the Shadhiliyya serves as a trunk out of which many branches emerge, so it is common to see references to the Shadhiliyya in hyphenated form.  For example, a full lineage of a northern Moroccan branch founded in 2007 would read Fawziyya-Alawiyya-Karkariyya-Darqawiyya-Shadhiliyya while another Egyptian branch is Jazuliyya-Husayniyya-Shadhiliyya.  The Shadhiliyya also has several branches of 'Western Sufism' (or led by western converts to Islam) such as the Murabitun (led by Ian Dallas aka Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Sufi), the Maryamiyya (founded by Fritjof Schuon), and Nuh Ha Mim Keller's Shadhili group in Jordan.  This interaction is not new, however, since its Andalusian spread potentially influenced a few Christian mystics like St. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila.

What unites these distinct branches is that they trace their ‘tariqa’ (literally path or way) back to al-Shadhili through a spiritual lineage (silsila).  The term ‘tariqa’ has most often been translated as ‘order,’ often drawing on an analogy between Sufi and monastic orders.  However, rather than referring simply to the social group, tariqa refers to the way of life that leads one to live a pious life and potentially encounter the divine.  This ‘way of life’ consists of an ensemble of exercises performed under the supervision and with the guidance of a master shaykh.  For example, the recitation of prayers (ahzab) attributed to the founder or the performance of poetry from a collective corpus of poems (diwan) from famous Shadhili shaykhs are a major part of what defines a group as Shadhili.  

In the case of the Shadhiliyya, some of the prominent figures include:

-	Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi (d. 1271): Considered al-Shadhili’s successor, al-Mursi was an Andalusian Sufi now considered to be one of the main saints of Egypt.  

-	Al-Busiri (d. 1294): This Moroccan author of the famous poem ‘The Mantle’ (al-Burda) was originally from southern Morocco and studied under al-Mursi in the Shadhili order.

-	Abu al-Qasim al-Himyari: Known as Ibn al-Sabbagh, he was the author of ‘The Pearl of Mysteries and the Gem of Purity’ (Durrat al-Asrar wa tuhfat al-abrar) that contains valuable biographical information about al-Shadhili that details his time in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt, serving as a primary source for subsequent biographical dictionaries (tabaqat).

-	Ibn Ata Allah al-Iskandiri (d. 1309): Credited with consolidating and spreading al-Shadhili’s teachings, this Egyptian leader of the Shadhiliyya is widely known for his book of aphorisms ‘al-Hikam’ (The Wisdom) and his autobiographical ‘Lata’if al-minan’ (Subtle Blessings) written in 1298.  This latter work articulates a conception of sainthood connected to an inheritance from and emulation of the Prophet Muhammad.

-	Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (d. 1390): Born in Ronda, Spain, he is known for his commentary on Ibn Ata Allah’s aphorisms and for potential influences on Christian mystics in the region.  He is buried in the Bab Ftuh cemetery in Fes, Morocco.

-	Ali b. Muhammad Wafa (d. 1405): This Egyptian Sufi of Mamluk lineage created the Wafa’iyya-Shadhiliyya branch with his father Muhammad, blending a spiritual heritage from al-Shadhili with a local familial authority that allowed the father to compose unique litanies (ahzab) that were spread by his son Ali.  In addition to blending different modalities of sanctity, the Wafa’iyya branch reflects an earlier attempt to integrate the thinking of Ibn Arabi and the Shadhiliyya.

-	Muhammad al-Jazuli (d. 1465): One of the seven saints of Marrakech, this famous Moroccan Sufi wrote a compilation of prayers on the Prophet Muhammad known in short as ‘The Waymarks of Benefits’ (Dala’il al-Khayrat).  His renown also made him a significant political figure and as he gained a following, he was expelled and eventually poisoned by a rival politician in 1465.  The Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya became one of the most prominent and influential branches during the medieval period.

-	Ahmad Zarruq (d. 1493): Labeled as a ‘conservative rebel’ by scholar of Islam Scott Kugle, Zarruq challenged al-Jazuli and his followers for their acceptance of sainthood grounded in popular politics and miraculous deeds.  In contrast, Zarruq presented himself as a ‘juridical saint,’ deriving his sanctity from his knowledge and practice of Islamic jurisprudence and performing that sanctity through the moral criticism of his surrounding society.  As such, he rebelled against what he saw as moral corruption (due in large part to divergent and exploitative saints) by articulating a conservative, reformed Sufism that placed a greater emphasis on jurisprudence.  He is an important early modern reformist thinker that would serve as a predecessor to later Sufi reform movements.

-	Muhammad b. Isa (d. 1526): Founder of the Aissawa (Isawa) order known for its music, trance dances, and intricate rhythmic structures, he was a member of the Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya that built his own lodge (zawiya) in Meknes, Morocco.  In Morocco today, they are often hired as musicians for different events, making them both a Sufi order and something like a professional musicians’ guild.

-	Abd al-Rahman al-Majdhub (d. 1568): This famous Moroccan poet is known by his nickname ‘al-Majdhub.’  Literally meaning mad or crazy, majdhub refers to a divinely inspired madness that prevents individuals from functioning properly in ordinary life but allows them to provide insight and blessings or perform miraculous deeds.  Many of his poems are so widespread that they are transmitted not as poems but as proverbs in Morocco.  He was a student in the lineage of Ahmad Zarruq and is said to have founded a Majdhubi-Zarruqi-Shadhili branch that presented a rival vision of sainthood to the popular Jazuli-Shadhili order of the time.

-	Ahmad ibn Ajiba (d. 1809): As an initiate in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, he was a prolific write widely known for his interpretation (tafsir) of the Quran ‘The Immense Sea’ (Al-Bahr al-Madid).  

-	Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi (d. 1823): This Moroccan Sufi was a spiritual, political, and military leader.  On the political and military side, he participated in revolts against foreign influences (Ottoman, Spanish, French) and against domestic leaders (Mawlay Sulayman) in the 19th century.  At the same time, many Moroccan elites and members of the Alawi royal family were members of the Darqawiyya.  In the 20th century under the French Protectorate, political expediencies resulted in a mix of confrontation and collaboration with French and Spanish authorities.  As a spiritual leader, al-Darqawi is best known through his letters and is recognized as a ‘renewer’ that gave rise to multiple branches.

-	Ahmad b. Idris (d. 1837): Of Moroccan origin, although he did not formally establish his own order, this prolific figure had a tremendous influence on several modern Sufi reform movements (often glossed as neo-Sufi orders).  Three of these influences include (1) Muhammad b. Ali al-Sanusi (d. 1859) – founder of the Sanusiyya order that resisted French colonialism in Libya –(2) Muhammad Uthman al-Mirghani (d. 1852) – founder of the Khatmiyya/Mirghaniyya in Sudan that would later become central to Sudanese politics – and (3) Abd al-Rahman al-Duwayhi al-Rashid (d. 1874) – founder of the Ahmadiyya-Rashidiyya branch that would spread through East Africa, the Middle East, northern India, and southeast Asia.  His teachings included an emphasis on Islamic jurisprudence and the renewal of independent legal reasoning (ijtihad) as a way to overcome the stagnation of legal thinking and blind adherence (taqlid), as well as a spiritual doctrine of the Muhammadan Way (tariqa Muhammadiyya) that sought both the emulation of the Prophetic model (sunna) and encounter with the Prophet Muhammad in a conscious state. 

-	Abd al-Rahman al-Fasi (d. 1878): Initiated in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, al-Fasi founded the Fasiyya branch in 1850 originally in Libya and later in Mecca with lodges in Yemen, Syria, and Egypt as well.  His most famous disciple was Abd al-Qadir al-Jizairi (d. 1883) who led a resistance movement against the French in Algeria and was eventually exiled to Damascus where he established a circle of followers under the spiritual patronage of al-Fasi.  This circle would be an important element in the development of modern Salafi thought.

-	Ahmad al-Alawi (d. 1933): Born in Mostaghanem, Algeria, Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi (born Ahmad b. Aliywa) founded the Alawi branch of the Darqawi-Shadhili in 1914.  While working in a variety of modern fields to encourage the integration of European and Islamic ideas Shaykh Alawi had a significant influence on several European thinkers (e.g., Guenon).  He is considered a ‘renewer’ of the Shadhili for his redeployment of the spiritual retreat (khalwa) with a specific articulation (talqin) of the name Allah as a primary practice for disciples.  Currently, the Alawiyya is headed by Shaykh Khalid b. Tunis and has membership throughout Europe and North Africa.",1258,2020,1064,800,John Thibdeau,2020-07-29 19:49:11.594 +0200,2020-08-14 20:37:22.557 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
915,Protestantism welcoming People with Disabilities,43,Religious Group (v6),"This group is unified by commitment to the inclusion of people with disabilities, rather than by geographical or other doctrinal unanimity. However, this commitment generates similar theological reflection and a shared range of social practices. Disagreement about the nature of inclusion persists; this group is distinguished by consistent participation in a conversation about disability inclusion. This entry will highlight how that conversation impacts these organizations' ritual, theology, and other social practices.

Most of this information is based on unpublished ethnographic research conducted by a team led by the Rev. Dr. Erin Raffety of the Center for Theological Inquiry from May - December of 2019, of which I was a part. Our team of 6 researchers worked with 10 organizations in the NJ-NY-PA area who were intentionally welcoming people with disabilities, with the goal of seeing what worked well and what could be done better. We received IRB approval before starting research from New England IRB. All participants signed consent forms showing their awareness of the research. Notes that lack explicit citation are based on this fieldwork, which will be published under the title, From Inclusion to Leadership: Congregational Ministry with People with Disabilities by Eerdmans Publishing in 2021. 

Through fieldwork, it became clear to me and the rest of our research team that one central question for these organizations concerns integrated vs segregated ministry. Ought churches start new programs to specifically welcome people with various disabilities? Or ought they reform their current programs and services such that people with disabilities can access them more effectively? 

Another prominent theme was reflection on the role of the Church in promoting the life and rights of people with disabilities. What ought churches provide and how can churches best support other non-profit organizations and schools that are already welcoming and supporting people with various kinds of disabilities? 

A final theme was the importance of empowering people with disabilities in addition to merely welcoming them. Many churches were eager to discuss different forms this could take, especially with regard to intellectual disability. Some were more reluctant but still open. What does it mean for people with intellectual disabilities in particular to be not just objects of ministry, but subjects? How might churches refine their conceptions of ministry and discipleship in light of this?

In this entry, I use the terms “people with disabilities” and “disabled people” interchangeably to represent some of the range of ways people with disabilities identify, some preferring person-first language and others not. Our research included people with a variety of physical disabilities (eg. blindness, mobility impairments), intellectual disabilities (Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down’s Syndrome), chronic illness (Crohn's, diabetes), and mental health challenges (depression, Bipolar Disorder).",2000,2020,1065,802,Kevin Vollrath,2020-07-29 21:57:54.030 +0200,2020-08-15 23:25:33.415 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

917,British Isles: Predominantly Celtic Polytheism,43,Religious Group (v6),"A survey of the polytheistic religions of the British Isles from 500-50 B.C.E. Created by Phillip A. Bernhardt-House.

918,Fangshi,43,Religious Group (v6),"Fangshi (方士) has been variously translated as technicians, masters of methods, recipes or esoterica, even necromancers. Historical records show that they were active through the period of the late Warring States to the Han. It is unlikely, however, that they had a collective identity as such, as scholar Nathan Sivin notes, “fangshi is not a social category but an epithet.” 
No writings by these men which would represent their voice directly have been left. Instead the Shiji 史記 (Records of the Historian), written by Sima Qian司馬遷 (c.145-c.86 BC) offers the most famous and earliest accounts of the fangshi. Overall described in a negative light, the historian tells us that they were hired to procure drugs of immortality—the first emperor of the Qin (r.247-210 BC) had a great desire to become a transcendent— and promised a way to ascend to Heaven through sacrificial offerings—the emperor Wu of the Han (r.140-87 BC) seems to have preferred this. 
Their origin is obscure. According to the Shiji, they were mostly from the coastal areas of the Qi and Yan states. Evidence of their presence came to light in the invitation of the first emperor of the Qin upon the latter’s imperial tours after the unification. Since then, they rose to prominence at the court of the Han. However, historians and thinkers, especially of the Eastern Han (25-220 CE) were increasingly critical of these men saying that they were just selling empty words. Despite this disapproval, they became widely popular and some were revered as cult figures. From the 2nd century CE, many fangshi were entered in hagiographies of transcendents (xian 仙). 
For this reason, it seems almost impossible to draw a clear boundary between historical and fictional accounts of these men. This makes it difficult to evaluate their historical importance to religious developments in China. Several questions remain to be answered: how much did their activities overlap with other technical specialists like physicians, astrologers and diviners? Did the yangsheng 養生 (nurturing life) practices—diet, drugs ingestion, gymnastics and breathing cultivation etc.—widely circulated during the Han originate from the methods of the fangshi? What is the relationship between this group and the transcendents found in early accounts like the Zhuangzi 莊子? Though often condemned or mysticized, it might be fairer to say that they occupied an intermediate position between those who strived for transcendence by cultivating their body and those in positions of power who sought immortality by occult recipes. Most significantly, they played a crucial role in shaping Daoist religious traditions of later periods as their methods and lineages were largely incorporated in the techniques and teachings of the Dao (daoshu 道術/daojiao 道敎).",-475,220,10,761,Lana Ko,2020-07-30 13:40:21.434 +0200,2021-09-29 20:33:29.103 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
919,Catholicism in contemporary Croatia,43,Religious Group (v6),"This database entry pertains to Roman Catholicism in contemporary Croatia. The geographical area covered corresponds to today's boundaries of the Republic of Croatia and the time period is delimited from 1995 to present-day (2020). Catholics represent the majority of the population in contemporary Croatia and have a very significant influence in the culture and politics of the country. It is widely accepted among scholars of the region that Catholicism is tightly bound together with Croatian ethnicity and national identity.

Undoubtedly, there are continuities between the religious group defined in this entry and other Catholic groups, in particular those in contemporary South and Southeastern Europe. Among these groups, Catholic Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the region of Herzegovina) and some regions of Serbia (e.g. Vojvodina) stand out. These populations largely identify as part of a single ethnic group that shares history and traditions (religious and otherwise) with most of the population of Croatia. Nevertheless, Catholic Croats residing in neighboring countries or those living further afield, sometimes referred to as Croatian diaspora, are not included in this entry. The reason for this is that there are important differences in regard to their relationship to the state, the political status of their religious group and identity, and their interaction with other religious groups within the polity in which they live.

Regarding the similarity between Catholicism in Croatia and elsewhere, there is also a significant degree of coincidence. The Catholic Church in Croatia is in full communion with the Vatican, which means that all dogma, doctrine and cannon law are essentially the same as in the rest of the world. However, particular histories and socio-cultural contexts produce unique features in tradition, practice and even belief in every context, and Croatia is no exception. In this database entry, specific elements and idiosyncrasies that distinguish Croatian Catholicism, such as the importance of pilgrimages, are elaborated in the qualitative notes of the relevant questions.

Just like in the geographical dimension, in the temporal one there is significant continuity between Croatian Catholicism as described in this entry and that of preceding historical periods (e.g. S. XX). This continuity is particularly clear in the domains of religious belief and practice. However, that is not the case in the political, sociological and cultural domains. In this entry, 'contemporary' has been defined as the period from 1995 onward. This year marks the beginning of a peaceful, democratic period in the history of Croatia, existing as an independent nation, that lasts until the present. The period comes immediately after a violent war (1991-1994) where the Republic of Croatia fought against the central  government in Belgrade to gain independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This war is part of what is commonly referred to as the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which led to the eventual disintegration of the SFR of Yugoslavia. The history of this series of armed conflicts is very complex and is outside of the scope of this database. However, it is important to know that the main factions involved are generally defined along ethno-religious lines and that the conflicts were plagued with atrocities committed along these same lines. Therefore, 1995 represents the beginning of the peacetime political order that still prevails in Croatia; an order which is different from the preceding one in regard to, among other things, the status of, and relationships between, different religious groups within the country.

Finally, it is important to note that, in a database entry such as this one, it is impossible to make justice to the richness and diversity of experience, practice, belief and tradition of any religious group and, especially, one with millions of members and a theological tradition of two millennia. The yes/no answers in this entry aim to reflect the most general response to the questions. However, there are cases where such general answers are not possible. This could be because there is no doctrine regarding a specific issue and no general consensus among members of the group, because there is are differences between the doctrine of the Church and widespread beliefs or practices, or simply because the issues are contested even among religious specialists. In general, when there is no obvious consensus answer to a question, this entry favours Church doctrine and teachings, in particular as defined by the Catechism of the Catholic Church. When this is not possible, or when the practices or beliefs of Catholics in Croatia differ overwhelmingly from doctrine, then the popular view is favoured. In these cases, explanations, caveats and further clarifications are included in the qualitative notes.",1995,2020,1068,801,Miguel Alcalde,2020-07-30 20:39:37.226 +0200,2020-08-14 19:57:09.527 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
921,Bhils,43,Religious Group (v6),"Bhils are a part of a geospatially dispersed tribal community of Western India. They are grouped under the constitutional category of Scheduled Tribes. While Bhili is the main language for the community, Bhils are known to be conversant with a variety of other vernacular languages depending on the region they reside in. Bhils have a rich tradition of orally transmitted religious literature which shares similarities with classical Hindu mythology and yet it is distinct in its own vernacular way. Bhils pay reverence to most popular Hindu gods, rituals, and customs; however, most of the gods and associated practices have hybrid histories with classical myths and practices fluidly blending in with vernacular variants.  


The term Bhil is thought to be derived from the word, Vill, which means bow in Telugu and Kannada. This is keeping in line with their reputation as skilled archers and hunters.  Historically, powerful Bhil kings are thought to have established their own kingdoms in what is present day Gujarat and Rajasthan. It was only through displacement by Rajput and Chalukya rulers of that time that Bhils were made to retreat into forests and hilly regions. Bhils are mentioned in historical records such as Ain-i-Akbari and ancient folk legends such as Kathasaritasagar. Mention of Bhils becomes clearer in the medieval period where their association with Marathas in their fight against the Mughals is well documented. Their knowledge of hilly and jungle terrains made them valuable allies for political powers hoping to control these regions. While some Bhil chiefs decided to assist local political powers, other clan chiefs would resort to resisting these powers often resulting in violent plunders of settled populations. With the influx of British colonialism, the anthropological urge to identify Bhils with primitivity and a prehistorical core of ancient India crystallized Bhil identity as that of Indian aborigines and native inhabitants of India. The British with their military might were more efficient in suppressing raids and plunders by Bhil chiefs. Through diplomatic ties and political manoeuvring, the British were also able to enlist peace treaties with the Bhils and also form Bhil Corps, an integral arm of the colonial law enforcement setup. 


Certain Indological scholarship and popular belief maintains that Bhils are the descendants of Niṣāda tribes mentioned in the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata. This association can be mainly traced to descriptions of Niṣādarashtra (the Kingdom of Niṣādas) as lying between Vindhya and Satpura mountains – the present-day heartland of Bhils. Due to this connection, several characters in the epics such as Eklavya in the Mahabharata and Sabari in Ramayana are thought to be Bhils. A similar historical and communal consciousness, along with issues of socioeconomic marginalization and lack of state assistance for rural development, has led to the development of indigenous political movements. One such movement aims to generate support for the creation of a separate state ""Bhil Pradesh"" to be carved out from specific districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.",1700,2020,1070,775,Maharshi Vyas,2020-07-30 22:24:11.149 +0200,2020-08-22 21:04:50.896 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

924,Muridiyya of Senegal,43,Religious Group (v6),"The country named Senegal is a creation of French colonialism in the late nineteenth century. The majority of the population are Muslims. One of the most influential Muslim groups is the Muridiyya founded by Ahmadu Bamba at the dawn of French colonialism. The capital of Muridiyya is Touba. The Murids practice a mystic Islam. The Murids are now spread throughout the world with the largest diaspora in New York. They hold social, political, and economic power in Senegal.
Ahmadu Bamba was born in a learned Muslim family and was educated by his parents. He chose Sufi path for its Islamic mysticism. He was attracted to Sufism for its ascetism and rejection of materialism in a context of the Wolof ruling class exploitation and the beginning of French colonization. He preached a peaceful Islam in his resistance against French colonialism. He privileged education because in his Sufi's conception of Islam, the war is against one’s soul (nafs in Arabic) or the bestial self of human being. He conceived the Tarbiyya as a mystical pedagogy to promote good work ethic and control the nafs. He organized his disciples into working groups known as daara tarbiyya which later became villages and towns. 
Bamba combined a mysticism rooted in Sharia with a focus on educating the heart. Islamic jurisprudence and the oneness of God was primordial to him, and he saw them as the soul and body of Islam. He rejected extreme ascetism and sees a Murid or a disciple as being an integral part of one’s community and being a mystic at the same time. The only time ascetism is allowed in Muridiyya is when the shaykh has to prepare himself for an imminent danger or when living in a politically corrupt environment where he is not listened to. His conception of Muslim education is focused on the Murid’s contribution to his community. Seeking a lifelong knowledge both esoteric and exoteric should be the primary goal of the disciple and the Qur’an should be at the center of this knowledge while striving to apply this knowledge in everyday life. The Taalim or exoteric education’s goal is to feed the brain, the tarbiyya or the esoteric knowledge is about strengthening the soul and the tarqiyya which is the highest and leadership level concerns a complete detachment from material world. 
In Bamba’s teachings, the Murid student should strive early in his life to combat ignorance, to be useful to his community, to enrich the science of Islamic religion and to put in practice the teachings while submitting to his Shaykh or teacher when seeking God.",1853,2022,1072,744,Azizou Atte oudeyi,2020-07-31 08:17:47.345 +0200,2022-05-05 18:13:57.040 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
925,Rabbinic Judaism (Babylonia),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Babylonian Jewish community dates back to the 6th century BCE, with the exile following the destruction of the first temple. Rabbinic Judaism emerges in Roman Palestine following the destruction of the second temple, producing legal and exegetical texts (the Mishna, Tosefta, and Halakhic Midrashim) during the Tannaitic Era. With the close of the Tannaitic era c.220 CE, the Amoraic sages Rav and Shmuel moved to Babylonia and began to teach Rabbinic traditions to the community there.


During the Amoraic Era (c. 220-500 CE), and the subsequent Saboraic and Gaonic eras, rabbinic teachings were collected and edited into the Babylonian Talmud, a corpus nearly 2 million words long. These traditions encompass a range of genre including biblical interpretation, legal discussions, theology, angels and demons, humor, and history. 

Jews primarily lived along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This region was home to a diverse population including Christians, Manichaeans, and Zoroastrians (the official Persian religion).

As a community with roots dating back centuries, Jews in the Sassanian Empire were tolerated and permitted to practice. An official position of ""Exilarch"" was recognized by the Empire. Literary accounts in the Talmud and Gaonic sources speak of persecutions against Jews by the empire in the latter part of this period, although scholars debate their historicity.

The map covers the region of the major Jewish settlements within Babylonia, not the entirety of the Babylonian empire.

An independent kingdom from the tenth century until 1834, Tibetan Buddhism remains the strongest religious influence, especially in the present-day district of Leh. From the 13th century onwards, Ladakhi kings upheld legitimacy through their roles as protectors of the Buddhist dharma, at one point annexing part of western Tibet; but, territorial acquisition was not sustainable. Political contact with Muslim neighbors increased from the 14th century onward through the 17th century when Mughal emperors asserted power over neighboring Kashmir. Following the Ladakh-Tibet-Mughal War 1679-1684, Ladhaki kings’ sustained religious allegiance to Tibetan Buddhism; meanwhile, Muslim populations increase coincided with the matrimonial union between the 17th century Buddhist king, ‘Jam-dbyang-rnam-rgyal, and the Muslim ruler of Baltistan’s daughter, RGyal Khatun. Following failed Portuguese Jesuit missionary efforts, British encounters increased only after 1834 when the armies of Zorawar Singh invaded. By 1842, Ladakh lost its independence to Dogra rule. Four years later, it fell under the state of Jammu-Kashmir which acknowledged the authority of British-India. Royal patronage of the monasteries subsided, but monasteries received some support from the state of Jammu-Kashmir and through sustained connections with Tibet. Indian independence in 1947 was met with the complicated uncertainty of the simultaneous partition of India and Pakistan. Following the imposition of a ceasefire line in 1949, Ladakh and Baltistan were cut off, but further wars between India and Pakistan in 1965 and 1972 continued over Jammu-Kashmir territorial disputes. As of October 31, 2019, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir became separate Union Territories where Ladakh remains under direct rule of New Delhi, India.

Our primary resource for data concerning the Zealots comes from the Jewish historian, Josephus (War 2.4; 2.13; 2.22; 4.3; Ant. 14.9; 14.15; 16.9; 20.9), who offers a biased presentation of certain radical sectarian movements during the First Jewish Revolt (66-73 CE). For this reason, historical descriptions of the Zealots within Josephus are to be evaluated with caution. Josephus makes reference to a ""fourth philosophy"" that he speaks of with great disdain. In addition to the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, this philosophy is founded by Judas the Galilean or ""of Gaulanitis"" (see also Acts 5:37) and a certain Pharisee named Saddok. This philosophy attracted a great many people, some of whom were young and ""zealous"" (Ant. 18.1). Other characteristics that Josephus ascribes to Judas' movement include a close affiliation with the philosophy of the Pharisees, an interest in freedom, and a belief that only God should be their ruler. 

Elsewhere, early Christian literature refers to a disciple of Jesus with the titular Simon ""the Zealot"" (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13); however, it is unclear if this terms refers to a religious group, a character trait of Simon (e.g., one who possesses zeal), or a geographical references (Matt 10:4; Mark 3:18). 

The Sicarii are traditionally understood as a more radical and violent subset of the Zealots led by the descendent of Judas, Eleazar (Josephus calls them a ""another sort of robbers"" in War 2.13); however, our sources are not always clear and some have advocated that the two groups be viewed as distinct from each other. The Greek term sikarios is a Latin loan word, meaning assassin, originating in Josephus (War 7.8-11; Ant. 20.9) with a lone reference in the book of Acts (21:38). It appears that the term derives from their weapon of choice, short daggers (see scimitar or sica). According to Josephus, the Sicarii assassinate Jonathan the High Priest and continue on from there to preform ""many"" other ""daily"" murders. The Sicarii are traditionally associated with Masada because of our account in Josephus: they are described as holding the fortress at Masada against the Romans (7.8.2), eventually committing mass suicide at the behest of Eleazar ben Yair; an event that some have described as Josephus' own literary invention. A wealth of archaeological discoveries have been made at Masada, which has lead some to corroborate Josephus' stories with material data (Yadin, Masada [1966]); however, such literal connections have been rightly questioned (see Jodi Magness, Masada: From Jewish Revolt to Modern Myth [2019]).

One of the challenges in differentiating these groups is the range of terms used in our sources including ""robbers"" (Greek: lēstai), ""sicarii""  (Latin: sicarius), ""Galileans"" (see Acts 5:37; Epictetus, Diss. 4.7.6), the ""Barjone"" in rabbinic texts, and the Zealots. Especially outside of Josephus in later rabbinic writings (e.g., Maksh 1.6), these terms appear to take on different meanings. For example, the term Zealot itself has come under scrutiny because the etymology of the semitic term ""zeal"" (qn') possesses a range of meaning outside of Josephus, including one who is zealous for God. With that said, some scholars insist that distinctions are necessary and important, especially considering the more violent descriptions of the Sicarii. Richard Horsley has characterized the Zealots as a group of ""non-violent, if active, resistance"" in stark contrast to the Sicarii (Bandits, Prophets, and Messiahs, 199). In one passage, Josephus appears to make a clear distinction between the Sicarii and Zealots (esp. War 7.8). Nonetheless, our source material is limited in that Josephus is both inconsistent and also shows contempt for both groups.",0,74,485,771,M.

928,The Ghost Dance Movement and the Lakota Sioux,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ghost Dance was a new religious movement founded by a Pauite Indian named Jack Wilson. After experiencing a spiritual vision of a heavenly realm during a solar eclipse on New Years Day of 1889, Wilson began to travel and preach a message of universal love and nonviolence to Indians across the present-day Western United States. Wilson was a spiritual leader among the Northern Paiute (a people who inhabited present-day Nevada) and commonly referred to as ""Wovoka."" This entry focuses on the practice and religion of the Ghost Dance, but especially on how Wovoka's movement took hold among the Lakota Sioux near the turn of the 20th century. Most historians accept that the persistent practice of the Ghost Dance by the Lakota as one of the most significant factors which lead the US military to attack and murder hundreds of non-combatant Lakota people at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota in the late December of 1890. This event, until relatively recently, was known as the ""Battle of Wounded Knee."" However, there has been a push in the field to call it what it was: The Wounded Knee Massacre.

The Ghost Dance itself consists of a traditional circle dance, where many of the participants fell into ecstatic trances and chants. While the ecstatic states and mix-gendered dancing that the ritual entailed grated puritan sensibilities, what made the ceremony threatening to US citizens and military leaders was the ideology and beliefs that lay at the foundations of the dance. Wovoka, as did many spiritual leaders before him of the Paiute, prophesied the return of the dead and the overturning of the current hegemonic [white] order. When the dead returned, they would expel the whites from the land, and traditional indigenous ways of life would return. Death and sickness would cease to exist, and all would reunite with their beloved dead. The Ghost Dance ritual itself was performed to hasten this return of the dead and the overthrowing of oppressive white settlers. Lakota Sioux especially emphasized the upheaval and transformation of the current order in their practice of the religion. Thus, it is easy to see why the method was disconcerting to white onlookers. 

However, critical to the coming of the dead was the strict adherence to a Christian-like moral code and an unwavering commitment to nonviolence. Wovoka forbade war between tribes and between Indians and the white man. He preached, especially against the practice of rituals which required self-mutilation, warned against lying and stealing, and encouraged all indigenous followers of his Ghost Dance Religion to work hard and earn money through the established systems of the emerging industrial economy. Therefore, while the Ghost Dance Religion was indeed apocalyptic, most scholars believe it primarily functioned to integrate indigenous people into modern society for the sake of Native survival. The thought goes that Wovoka was trying to ensure indigenous flourishing while providing something like a societal pressure valve and release through the apocalyptic hope and practice of the Ghost Dance.",1860,1910,1075,732,James Waters,2020-08-01 01:52:38.301 +0200,2020-08-05 22:42:23.964 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
929,Drikung Kagyu,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Drikung Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism is a subsect of the Kagyu school, whose main teachings were passed from Mahasiddha Tilopa (988-1069) to his disciple Mahasiddha Naropa (1016-1100), and from Naropa to the Tibetan master Marpa (1012-1097), who brought the teachings to Tibet. Marpa’s principle student was Jetsun Milarepa (approximately 1040-1123), who passed on the teachings to his students, including Gampopa (1079-1153) from whom the Karma Kagyu, Tselpa Kagyu, Barom Kagyu and Phagdru Kagyu sects were founded. Gampopa’s student Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170) was the teacher of the founder of the Drikung Kagyu sect, Jigten Sumgon (1143-1217). Jigten Sumgon was the grandson of Achi Chokyi Dolma, a great female practitioner who would later come to be a protective deity of the Drikung Kagyu. Jigten Sumgon founded the monastery of Drikung Thil in Central Tibet, which would come to be the center of religious activity for the Drikung Kagyu. The main teachings of the Drikung Kagyu are the Six Yogas/Dharmas of Naropa, the Jewel Ornament to Liberation of Gampopa, the Fivefold Mahamudra (thus named by Phagmo Drupa), the Gongchik of Jigten Sumgon, as well as the biographies and devotional songs of the great Drikung masters (most prominently the 100,000 songs of Milarepa). Up until the 17th century, power was primarily passed hereditarily within the Kyura clan. The Kyura lineage ended with the brothers Gyalwang Konchog Rinchen (1590–1654) and Kunkhyen Rigzin Chödrak (1595–1659). They were recognized as the 1st Chetsang (older brother) and 1st Chungtsang (younger brother). Both of these positions have passed through reincarnation up until present day. They are now held by Chungtsang Rinpoche Tenzin Chokyi Nangwa (b. 1942), who lives in Tibet, and Chetsang Rinpoche Konchog Tenzin Kunsang Trinley Lhundrup (b. 1946), who lives in India. Although the seat of the Drikung Kagyu is located in Central Tibet, Drikung Kagyu monasteries, retreat centers and dharma organizations have been established all over the world. The Drikung Kagyu enjoy significant influence in the Nangchen region of Kham, as well as in Ladakh and Dehradun (the site of the Drikung Kagyu seat in exile) in India.

931,The Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in Britain,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Jesuits are a Catholic missionary order that follows the tradition of St Ignatius of Loyola, the first Superior General of the Jesuits in 1541. The Jesuits are the largest Catholic order of men in the world, and their headquarters are in Rome, close to the Vatican. Pope Francis is the first Jesuit Pope. 

The Society of Jesus in Britain, commonly known as the Jesuits, came to Britain during a mission from Italy in 1580. Jesuits are neither monks nor friars but 'clerks regular'. They take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and live in community. Most are priests, but there have always been Jesuit brothers who assist the Society's mission without ordination. Many Jesuit priests also take a fourth vow, unique to the Society of Jesus, of special obedience to the Pope with regard to missions. Jesuit historiography in Britain can is typically organized by Jesuit activity pre and post suppression with regards to The Reformation in Europe. A significant aspect of the history of the English Jesuits after their restoration was their missionary outreach. New missionary endeavors by the English Province of Jesuits included began in 1837–94, and the English Province of Jesuits still maintains a mission in Guyana. The Jesuits first came to Guyana in 1857. Since then, we have been serving the Catholic Church & people in all parts of this beautiful, remote, and oft-forgotten South American country. Today, the public perception of Jesuits in the modern period is still shaped by notable preachers, popular writers, and engaging personalities.",1580,2020,1078,808,Katherine Ajibade,2020-08-01 23:41:55.917 +0200,2020-08-15 17:37:00.311 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
933,Marcionites,43,Religious Group (v6),"Marcionism was a branch of early Christian thought often deemed ""gnostic"" or heretical by detractors like Tertullian of Carthage. It is often associated with Marcion of Pontus, a second-century Christian preacher that came to Rome around 144 CE. Marcion is best remembered for his belief that Jesus was the Savior, but was sent by a God other than the one known to readers of Jewish Scripture. Instead of representing the God of Israel, Marcion believed that Jesus’s God was not the God that created the universe, but was a deity that was not known among humans until Jesus’s arrival.

Marcion is best known for his compilation of Christian texts. Marcion read the Gospel of Luke and ten of Paul’s letters, and some scholars have suggested that Marcion’s use of these eleven texts constituted one of our earliest Christian canons. Paul, as apostle to the Gentiles, was understood by Marcion to be one of the few early Christians who understood that Jesus preached a different God than the God of Israel. However, it is unclear of Marcion himself initiated the collection of Paul’s letters that he used, or utilized a collection already in use. The same goes for Marcion’s use of the Gospel of Luke. Some heresiologists argued that Marcion mutilated the Gospel text by removing particular scenes, such as the birth narrative of Jesus. However, it seems likely that Marcion used a version of Luke’s gospel already in circulation.

Early heresiologists like Justin, Tertullian, and Epiphanius preserve much of our information about Marcion and Marcionite Christians. However, their work is tinged with polemic and likely does not represent Marcion’s own thought, but rather what other Christians feared about Marcionite treatments of God, Christ, and scripture. They accuse Marcion of extreme asceticism and for treating Jesus as a human upon whom Christ descended, as well as that he divorces Jesus’s teaching from any continuity with Jewish scriptures.",144,1000,1080,754,Chance Bonar,2020-08-02 18:11:17.199 +0200,2020-08-02 18:11:17.199 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
934,Mongolian Buddhism during the Revolutionary Period,43,Religious Group (v6),"At the beginning of the twentieth century, what is now the country of Mongolia, was a suzerainty of the Qing Empire. The country was divided into different banners ruled by nobles who could claim their legitimacy to their ancestral connections to Chinggis Khan. The nation was essentially feudalist, with noble families connected to temples who were often headed by reincarnation lineages. By 1911, when Mongolia declared independence from the crumbling rule of the Manchurian Dynasty, Buddhist monasteries connected to Tibetan lineages (mostly Gelug) had amassed considerable wealth and power in the preceding centuries. In the 1918 census around 110 000 people were monastics, around half of the adult male population. Around one third of these were celibate living within monastic compounds. The wealth of the temples varied greatly with some, such as the great estate of the Tibetan-born reincarnation the Eighth Javzandamba, ruling over 90 000 disciples. During the erratic beginnings of the twentieth century, Buddhist institutions saw a short-lived consolidation of their power as the Eighth Javzandamba took a position of seniority over the nation from 1911. In 1920, following a series of escalating incursions from the south, a group of revolutionary Mongolians travelled north in search of Russian assistance. In 1921 a group of White Russians, led by the notoriously brutal Russian Baron Ungern-Sternberg, arrived in the capital Khüree (now Ulaanbaatar) removing Chinese authorities and re-installing the power of the Eighth Javzandamba. Dismayed by the continued presence of the ‘Mad Baron’ in the country, in July 1921 the group of revolutionary Mongolians returned, backed by the Bolsheviks and entered the capital to oust the Baron’s army. Following the Eighth Javzandamba’s death in 1924, in 1926, the new socialist government began a campaign to undermine the power and influence of the monastic establishments. Initially this campaign was relatively non-violent and set about to decrease the wealth and authority of Buddhist institutions through heavy taxation and education campaigns. From 1929 to 1932 the country saw intensified violence against monasteries, followed by a reprieve when the excessive use of force and the destruction of sacred items caused uprisings and rebellions. Following this period posthumously named ‘The Leftish Deviation’, the government returned to mostly non-violent strategies, encouraging class consciousness among the poorer herders and disciples and increased the taxation of the temples. In 1937 the policies once again turned violent under the rule of prime minister Choibalsan, focusing on campaigns against Buddhist lamas, ethnic Buryats, intellectuals and other sources of opposition. Monasteries were destroyed and looted, lamas forcibly disrobed, and around 13 000 lamas were killed. As Christopher Kalponski writes “In September 1937, there had been 83,203 lamas in the monasteries. On 25 July 1938, there were 562.” By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country and for the next 50 years the government continued its policy of religious repression. The public practice of religion was outlawed, with only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid, functioning as a showcase for the nation’s religious tolerance.",1911,1940,1081,751,Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,2020-08-03 11:26:42.728 +0200,2020-08-03 11:26:42.728 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
935,Nigerian Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pentecostalism has become a major cultural force in Nigeria since the early twentieth century, accounting for approx. 63% of Nigerian Christians today (World Christian Database). The success of Pentecostalism across Nigeria and Africa more widely has resulted in the widespread absorption of Pentecostal styles of worship into 'mainstream' African Protestant and Catholic churches (the latter known as 'Charismatic' churches). Pentecostals emphasise the active presence of the Holy Spirit both in worship settings and beyond, evidenced in miracles, healings, prophecies, tongues (glossolalia) and other 'gifts of the Spirit'. Nigerian Pentecostals tend to regard their religious faith as a means by which to ‘break’ with their ‘pagan’ heritage, and becoming born again as a way to be delivered from indigenous African spiritual and cultural life (Meyer 1998). Some Pentecostal churches place a strong emphasis on tithing and material success (‘Prosperity’), whilst others are more focused on asceticism and purity ('Holiness'), or healing and exorcism (‘Deliverance’).
Pentecostalism in Nigeria is widely recognised to have unfolded in three phases. The first phase, known as Aladura, or the African Initiated/Independent Church movement, (1910-1930s) was led by Yoruba itinerant preachers like Joseph Ayo Babalola who clashed with missionaries on the use of medicine (Peel 1968). The Aladura movement, meaning ‘praying people’, emphasised prayer, healing and deliverance from traditional 'pagan' religion. In this period, foreign Pentecostal denominations like the Classical Pentecostal church, Assemblies of God, and the Welsh Apostolic church also laid down roots in Nigeria.
The second wave, known as the 'Latter Rain' revival, took place in the 1950s and was initiated by British and American evangelists like Sydney Granville Elton and Oral Roberts. This phase emphasised deliverance, healing and also apocalyptic eschatology.
The third wave, known as the Neo-Pentecostal movement, emerged in the 1960s-80s and was heavily influenced by ideas and trends introduced to Nigeria in American evangelical literature. Open air revivals, especially on university campuses such as the Universities of Ibadan and Ife, led to an influx of young converts to the movement. Some denominations emphasised Holiness and millennialism (1970s) whilst others propagated the Prosperity Gospel (80s onward). This period saw the emergence of the Nigerian Pentecostal megachurches like Deeper Life Bible Church and the Church of God Mission International. Moreover, since the 1990s, demonology, spiritual warfare and the practice of Deliverance have become increasingly popular features of Nigerian Pentecostalism.",1910,2020,1082,810,Naomi Richman,2020-08-03 16:14:12.377 +0200,2020-08-19 14:46:38.745 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
937,Vestal Virgins,43,Religious Group (v6),"Introduction: No other religious group for women in antiquity has the same amount of written and visual evidence than the Vestal Virgins of Rome. The order of the Vestal Virgins belonged to the pontifical college (collegium pontificum) and was one of Rome's largest and most illustrious religious orders that spanned roughly a millennium. Their centrality to Roman religion and the Roman state is demonstrated by the fact that their lodging quarters was located on the Roman Forum itself that was, for most of its history, the civic center of the Roman Republic and Empire until Emperor Theodosius closed the Vestal Order in AD 394.
Even the antiquity of the Vestal Virgins described in ancient literature demonstrates their importance to Roman culture, and especially the wealth fare of the state. The Vestal order was said to have originated in the times of the legendary king Numa (Cic. Rep.2.64.14; Dion Hal. Ant.Rom. II.64.5-67.1; Ov.Fast.6.357-260; Plut.Num. 9.5), but the very first Vestal Virgin in Roman mythology was Rhea Silvia: the mother of Romulus and Remus (Livy I.4.2; Dion. Hal. Ant.Rom.I.75.1-77.4; Ov.Fast.2.383-86, 3.11), thus, the Vestals Virgins were even older than the city of Rome!
Selection Process: In order to become a Vestal Virgin, a rigid process overseen by the Pontifex Maximus ensued that scrutinized the girl’s age (no less than six and no more than ten years old), legal status (originally patrician, but later plebeians could enter), and physical condition: her virginity had to be absolute, since this was the most important qualification. An extant description of this process is recorded in Aulus Gellius’ Atticues Noctes I.12.1-8 in which other physical requisites, such as not having any impairment to hearing or speech, and exemptions are detailed. Though rather young by modern standards, the age of seven in Roman society allowed a girl to participate in both public and private rituals. Furthermore, nearly ninety percent of girls died before the age of six and those that did were more likely to survive into adulthood and fulfill the thirty-year requirement of the Vestal order. Wildfang also postulates that the age of six aided in detecting any physical defects, especially speech impediments. Finally, Wildfang also argues that the limit of the age of ten, is to ensure that a candidate’s virginity is intact before she underwent puberty.
Once the candidates passed the requirements, it seems that the Pontifex drew lots in public during the Roman Republic according to the Lex Papia. DiLuzio notes the scholarly debate around the Lex Papia (68 BC) in which the stipulation of drawing lots “e populo” suggests that, perhaps, at the time, plebein daughters could be candidates for the priesthood. Some evidence suggests that plebein order could participate in the Vestals as far back as 337 BC, where the Vestal Minucia was executed for incestum as Livy (VIII.15.7-8) and scholar Rüpke note.
To conclude our remarks on the selection process, it is important to note some changes during the Roman Empire. DiLuzio has shown that in AD 5 Augustus opened-up the Vestal Virgins to the daughters of freedman as well when there was a shortage of candidates. Then, under Tiberius, senators could offer their daughters directly when a vacancy occurred at the death of Occia and, thus, abrogated the 20-candidate necessity.                                                                                                                                                                        
Initiation Rite: The initiation rite, what is called a “captio”, is also described fully by Gellius (N.A. I.12.13-14). The Pontifex seized the selected candidate by the hand from her father and pronounced the words: sacerdotem Vestalem, quae sacra faciat quae ius siet sacerdotem Vestalem facere pro populo Romano Quiritibus, uti quae optima lege fuit, ita te, Amata, capio (Thus, I take you, Amata, just as she was of perfect law, as a Vestal priestess to do the sacred rites that the law permits the Vestal priestess to do on behalf of the Roman people). Many scholars, such as DiLuzio, Santinelli, and Mary Beard, have noted that the ritual bear a marked similarity to those of a Roman wedding in which the bride is also taken away from the lap of her mother in a simulated abduction. Furthermore, the Vestal dressed her hair in the seni crines (six-tressed) style that was also used by brides in the Roman wedding. As DiLuzio notes, these details a symbolic wedding between the Pontifex and the Vestal virgin. Parting with Beard who sees this rite that marked the Vestal as an interstitial figure, DiLuzio rejoins that it symbolizes the complete transition of the candidate from a private, domestic figure into one in service of the Roman people and state by removing her from her house.  
Duties: The legal, ritual, and privileges conferred to the Vestal Virgin depended upon her ability to maintain perpetual virginity, a quality that, apart from the Vestal Virgins, was not valued in ancient Roman life generally. DiLuzio notes that this need for perpetual virginity parallels concerns for ritual purity and that in the Roman mind these were one and the same for the Vestal Virgins. Furthermore, their virginity also symbolized the health and welfare of the Roman state. For example, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (IX.40) records a pestilence that affected Rome and, upon investigation, it was discovered that the Vestal Urbinia lost her virginity and was performing public rites. Upon the punishment of Urbinia and the two men, the plague was lifted. 
Another duty, which is also linked to their chastity, was to perpetuate the fire of Vesta, the goddess of the hearth (perhaps, as far back as the period of Roman monarchy in which Vesta was the goddess of the private, royal hearth) and heart of Rome as Staples and DiLuzio note. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (II.68) recounts that the fire of Vesta went out and a case ensued in which the Vestal Aemlia was tried. In asking for Vesta for aid, Aemlia cast her garment onto the altar and a great fire appeared as if giving proof to Aemelia’s service and chastity.",-800,394,872,733,Juan Dopico,2020-08-03 17:28:58.351 +0200,2020-08-06 21:04:06.388 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

940,Julio-Claudian Imperial Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"The term ‘imperial cult’ refers to the worship of the emperor and imperial family throughout the Roman Empire. Two factors make classifying and clarifying the practice of imperial cult difficult. First, religion was not separate from the political and secular sphere at Rome; as such it is difficult to determine whether the imperial involvement in religious practice was primarily driven by religious impulses as opposed to political motives. Second, because of the diversity of the Roman Empire, there is no unity to the practices of emperor worship. (In general, we distinguish between cultic observance in the Eastern empire, Western empire, and at Rome.) Bearing these two factors in mind, the following is an attempt to chart the beginnings of imperial cult under the Julio-Claudian emperors. 

The Augustan principate marked the transition between Republican and Imperial forms of government. However, the regime operated on the premise that Augustus, who was, post-Actium, simply an ordinary Roman citizen, restored the Republic. This façade made the operations of the cult especially problematic and the imperial household was deliberately obscure in the language it used to describe cultic activity (cf. Rives: 2007). Augustus himself was the son of a god: Julius Caesar had been divinised. Caesar’s career proved a beneficial model for articulating imperial divinity. Augustus used his divine genealogy to create an aura of specialness around himself; but he was equally aware that Caesar’s regal and divine posturing had contributed to sending him to an early grave. For more on Caesar and the cult see Weinstock: 1971.

Most scholars understand the worship of the emperor in the eastern provinces as a continuation of the customary practice of ruler-cult (cf. Cerfaux and Tondriau: 1957; Fears in Grant and Kitzinger ed. 1988; Klauck: 2003; Taylor: 1979). Augustus would not be unprecedented in this. Roman officials had received divine honours in eastern cities before (e.g. Marcus Claudius Marcellus in Syracuse from 212BC onwards); however, these examples are confined to single cities. Thus, a development came in 29 BC when temples to Augustus and the goddess Roma were granted to provinces in Asia and Bythinia-Pontus. However, the acceptance of these temples can be interpreted as an established method of assimilating Roman rule with the practices of the region.

Provinces requested the emperor’s permission before building temples to him and there are many examples of requests denied. It was common early on for the emperor to be associated with the goddess Roma as a way of softening the claim to divinity. In 15BC Hispania Tarraconensis gained permission for a temple to Augustus and Rome (cf. Fishwick: 2014) and in 12BC three provinces of Gaul established an altar to Augustus at Lugdunum (Livy, Epit. 139). These examples set a precedent for one way we can understand imperial cult. In general it was used to create cohesion and unity throughout the empire (cf. Gordon in Beard and North ed. 1990). Cult practice brought neighbouring communities together in acts of worship; it also cemented their relationship with Rome. As such imperial cult was a tool for empire building. 

The situation at Rome is even more complex; asking freeborn citizens to worship the emperor, however obliquely, was a delicate process (cf. Price in Bowman, Champlin & Lintott ed. 1996). In 7BC Augustus had reorganised the cults of the 265 districts (‘vici’) of the city; henceforth officials worshiped the Augustan Lares and the emperor’s ‘genius’ at these shrines. Every Roman had a ‘genius’ and the worship of a paterfamilias’ ‘genius’ is attested; these shrines, therefore, might be more aimed at treating the emperor as a father figure. Indeed, Augustus was eventually granted the title ‘father of his country’ (‘pater patriae’). Moreover, it seems these shrines were primarily overseen by freedmen and so worship at them was directed not at the political elite. There is also evidence that Augustus’ ‘genius’ was worshipped in private households; again this could be understood as part of envisioning the emperor as a paternal figure and assimilating veneration of him with traditional ancestor worship. For more on these issues see Scheid in Belayche ed. 2001 & Lipka: 2006.

After Augustus’ death in 14AD, the emperor Tiberius was equally guarded in his attitude to cult activities. Augustus was deified after death (as Caesar had been before him). This entitled Tiberius to also style himself a divi filius (son of a god). The key policy was to provide all due honour and respect to Augustus (Tacitus, Ann. 1.15; cf. Cowan: 2009). For living members of the imperial family, and the emperor himself, the situation was more difficult. Tiberius was selective in what honours he would receive and where he would have temples built. For example, though Tiberius accepted a temple to himself (together with the senate and Livia) in Asia, he refused one in Spain; his reason was, apparently, a desire to follow Augustan precedent in accepting some honours, but not to cheapen Augustus’ divinity by allowing widespread sycophantic worship of the current emperor to eclipse reverence for his divinised predecessor (Tacitus, Ann. 4.37). As with Augustus, the cult was still primarily located in the East, and worship of the living emperor was combined with an abstract divinity that signified allegiance to Rome (in this case the senate). It is telling, however, that Tiberius’ mother Livia was now also involved. We are gradually moving towards a situation where a family, and not exceptional individuals, are being marked out as super-human. 

Cultic practice took on a new complexion with Gaius Caligula’s ascension to the principate (37AD). A young man with apparent mental problems, Caligula marks a turn in the imperial government because he was the first emperor to ‘inherit’ based on family ties alone. Both Tiberius and Augustus had been great statesmen in their own right; at 25, Caligula had had little experience in government and military affairs. He seems to have been influenced by ideas of Hellenic ruler-cult, and perhaps even Egyptian notions of imperial divinity; sources record that he replaced the heads of the statues of the gods with his own image and sat between the Dioscuri in their temple to be worshipped with them. There is even serious suggestion that he set up his own temple in Rome with priests and a golden cult image of himself (Suetonius, Calig 22; Claud. 9; Dio 59.28.6; cf. Bilde: 1978). Imperial women also gained in influence: Caligula’s sisters appeared on coins associated with the goddesses Securitas, Fortuna, and Concordia (cf. Wood: 1995). When his sister Drusilla died in 38AD she became the first imperial female to be deified (Dio 59.11). Though accusations of madness and incest make for entertaining anecdotes in our sources, it is hard not to see an attempt on Caligula’s part to use Hellenic and Egyptian models of ruler-cult to secure his own imperial position. If he had come to power on the basis of his family, it might be beneficial to emphasise the exceptionality of his breeding. The experiment failed, however, and Caligula was assassinated in 41AD.  

Under Claudius, the penultimate Julio-Claudian emperor, we see further evolution of imperial cult practice. Governing after Caligula’s murder in 41AD, Claudius was significantly more cautious than his nephew in all areas. He appears to have reverted to Tiberius’ practice of bolstering the dead and deified and taking the spotlight off himself. This also helped raise the prestige of the family at the same time and under him Livia, the wife of Augustus, was deified (Suetonius, Claud. 11).  

After his conquest of Britain, Claudius agreed to a massive temple complex to himself at Camulodunum in the province (Tacitus, Ann. 14.31). Britain was a troublesome province and the use of the cult centred around the emperor’s person indicates the way in which the religion aimed to foster unity and adherence to the empire. There is no evidence that Claudius shared this temple with another divinity (cf. Fishwick: 1961): if this is so, it marks a crucial turning point in imperial worship, where the emperor and empire are being collapsed into the same idea. However, in a move similar to Tiberius, Claudius rejected a surfeit of temples. In a surviving letter to the Alexandrians he declines, and expresses his distaste for, a purported temple to himself (despite having such a temple in Britain already). The letter illustrates the difficulties in defining imperial cult practices throughout the empire. However, the information we have implies that successful emperors were cautious in their approach growing the cult slowly and never indulging in excessive honours for themselves.

Imperial cult was a useful weapon for growing allegiance to the empire and imperial family as the provinces expanded and the Julio-Claudian family attempted to retain power. However, it was a double-edged sword: too much self-aggrandisement could pave the way for ridicule and sedition. Thus, though the cult is slippery to pin down it is a fascinating index of the development of imperial power and growth in the period.",-31,68,132,767,Treasa Bell,2020-08-04 18:30:00.660 +0200,2021-03-09 18:00:42.306 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
941,Chan Buddhists in early Qing period,43,Religious Group (v6),"Chan Buddhists refer to the religious practitioners of Chan, reflected in the Chan texts like “recorded sayings” and “lamp transmission.” It is believed that the legendary figure Bodhidharma from India first brought Chan to China. Eminent Chan patriarchs, especially the Sixth Patriarch Huineng (638–713), developed Chan Buddhism during the Tang-Song periods. When it came to the seventeenth century, the reprint and publication of abundant Chan texts marked the revival of Chan Buddhism in the early Qing Dynasty. Divided into two major lineages (Caodong and Linji), Chan Buddhists frequently used “encounter dialogues” and the act of beating and shouting to express their understanding of awakening. Chan Buddhism emphasizes intuition over textual study, the role of meditation in cultivating one’s mind, and the importance of master-disciple relationship in the transmission of dharma. Chan Buddhists affiliated with the same lineage were loosely organized as a group as shown in the documental evidence of dharma transmission. The Chan Buddhists disputed with each other about the criteria of enlightenment and the authenticity of the lineages of dharma transmission in their textual works, which stimulated the revival of Chan Buddhism in the seventeenth century. The religious group not only includes elite Chan Buddhists who authored voluminous works, but also common Buddhists and lay people who practiced Chan.",1600,1700,1087,789,Nan Ouyang,2020-08-04 18:56:04.612 +0200,2021-09-29 20:43:09.513 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
942,African Methodist Episcopal Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1787, roughly a decade after America’s independence from Great Britain and almost a century before Black Americans were guaranteed U.S. citizenship, a group of Black congregants walked out of Philadelphia’s primarily white St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in the middle of the Sunday service. One of these protesters, Black Methodist minister Richard Allen, eventually founded America’s first independent Black denomination and its oldest formal Black institution—the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Described by W.E.B. Du Bois as the world’s “greatest Negro organization,” the AME Church is a Protestant Christian denomination aligned doctrinally with the United Methodist Church and organized in an Episcopal system. 

To tell the story of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one must first turn to the history of Methodism, its antecedent. Originated by English minister John Wesley, the transatlantic denomination became ubiquitous in eighteenth and early nineteenth-century America through the revivals of the First and Second Great Awakening. Historians often remark on the egalitarian and democratic nature of these revivals. While it is important for us not to romanticize early Methodism, thereby ignoring Black people's experiences of discrimination and systemic racism within the religious culture and society more broadly, we can still recognize that some enslaved people managed to make a home for themselves within the Methodist fold and, to some extent, were even accepted into communal worship spaces. The fact that services were held in large, open-air fields created a come-one, come-all atmosphere, and ecstatic, embodied worship experiences were customary. It was into this Methodist culture that Richard Allen was converted as a seventeen-year-old enslaved person in 1777. And ten years later, when he led a group of Black Methodists out of St. George's, it was as a consequence of this Methodist culture that he protested. 

While the Methodism to which Allen had been introduced as a young man was more open to Black congregants, the religious culture he experienced at the turn of the eighteenth century was increasingly stratified by race. Although sizable numbers of Blacks had been evangelized by Methodists and even licensed to preach in the mid-1700s, white Methodists started to neglect earlier ideals of acceptance in lieu of pursuing respectability and becoming an established church. Among other practices, white Methodists began to deny Black members leadership roles within the denomination and some white Methodist preachers even refused to hold Black babies during infant baptisms, as historian Julius H. Bailey has shown. Separating from St. George's signified Allen’s rejection of the inequitable treatment of African Americans in Methodist spaces, his recovery of early Methodism’s egalitarian ideals and his articulation of a new religious vision that embraced the humanity of Black Americans. After starting a church of his own in 1794 (Mother Bethel AME), Allen and a collective of other Black Methodists established their own denomination in 1816 with Allen as the organization’s first Bishop. 

Commitments to racial justice and what twentieth-century AME minister and theologian James H. Cone would later name Black liberation theology have served as the cornerstones of the two-hundred-year-old denomination. In the antebellum period, AME churches served as posts for the Underground Railroad. During Reconstruction, Northern AME missionaries travelled southward to teach formerly enslaved people how to read. Today, AME churches provide community programming that, according to their mission statement, aims to “enhance the entire social development of all people.” Furthermore, missionization, particularly in Africa, has been a primary component of the church’s work, leading to the establishment of the denomination in over thirty countries.",1816,2020,1095,804,Mélena Laudig,2020-08-04 23:10:43.804 +0200,2020-08-18 20:03:51.195 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
943,Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Moravian Church or the Unitas Fratrum, originated in early 15th century Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic. Moravians were the first large-scale Protestant Missionary movement, spreading across the globe. Missionary work, ecumenism, personal piety and an emphasis on liturgical music and worship are tenets of the Moravian faith. This entry focuses on Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut, the Inuit self-governing region of northern Labrador. It tracks social changes along several centuries of occupation, as well as how Inuit resisted and accomodated Moravian beliefs and sociality. Moravians first journeyed to Labrador in 1752, after Johann Christiann Erhardt, a newly converted seaman, traveled to Greenland, where Moravians had started to evangelize Inuit in 1733, using to their advantage the connections to the Danish court of their leader Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700-1760). Erhardt became convinced that he would be able to communicate with and interact with Inuit across the Strait in British North America after reading travel accounts depicting Inuit in Labrador. The first attempt to establish a mission in Nisbet's Harbour failed, with members of the expedition supposedly killed. In 1771, the first permanent Moravian community is established on the Labrador Coast and called Nain, and soon follows a mission station at Okak in 1776, and Agvituk (now known as Hopedale) in 1777. Missionaries chose locations to set up stations based on Inuit hunting, fishing, and whaling grounds, hoping that establishing themselves near historical winter camps would encourage Inuit to ""settle"" near them. This ""settling"" was instrumental to the conversion process. It allowed missionaries to keep watch over Inuit, encourage them to attend Church and festivals, and gave them a large amount of control over the flow of European goods. Control over trade meant control over Inuit subsistence activities, as Inuit converts were obligated to participate in the Moravian cod and fur economy, rather than spending their time hunting whale and caribou, which Moravians discouraged. In 1831, a mission station was established at Hebron, located 80 miles north of Okak, in 1865 a mission station was established at Zoar south of Nain, in 1871 a sixth station was established at Ramah (it would be closed in 1907), in 1896 a mission station was established at Makkovik, and in 1904 the eighth and final Moravian mission station opened at Killinek, at the northern tip of Labrador. The Moravian missions in Labrador struggled financially throughout its history. Events that stand out include the 1918 Spanish Flu in Labrador, which killed more people proportionally in Nunatsiavut than anywhere else on earth, with a mortality rate of 71% at Okak and Hebron. The Spanish Flu was brought to Labrador by way of the annual Mission supply ship and spread rampantly through the coast. Because of the remoteness of the Labrador coast, missionaries served as doctors and administrators, as the governmental presence was minimal. Moravians, along with the provincial government, ran the residential schools in the region and were responsible for intense physical, sexual, and psychological trauma of Inuit children during the mid-late 19th century. The last missionary left Nunatsiavut in 2005, the same year that the region became self-governing. Community members continue to carry on certain Moravian traditions and many self-identify as Moravian, serving as ministers in their own communities. Many Nunatsiavut Inuit have also called for there to be a reckoning with the colonial violence inflicted by Moravian missionaries, particularly surrounding residential schools. Youth have also taken up the cause for a re-evaluation of Moravian presence in Nunatsiavut. There is currently a youth-led movement to change the name of schools on the coast named for Moravian missionaries such as Jens Haven Memorial School in Nain and Amos Comenius in Hopedale.",1752,2020,1091,788,Emma Gilheany,2020-08-05 04:18:23.682 +0200,2020-08-16 18:31:47.681 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
944,Mohyla's Ukrainian Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"A community of Orthodox believers in Ukraine who abide to the standards and practices of the Orthodox religion renewed in the course of Petro Mohyla's (1597-1647) reforms in the seventeenth century. Petro Mohyla’s reforms were motivated by religious competition in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
In the 1620s, aristocratic dynasties that traditionally supported the Orthodox Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth either converted to Catholicism, or disappeared. However, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, received a new supporter in the figure of the Cossacks, armed men of diverse social backgrounds. In 1620, the Cossacks helped to elect a new metropolitan for the part of the Orthodox Church that did not recognize the superiority of the Pope. In 1632, the Polish king recognized equal rights between the restored Orthodox Church and the Uniate, Catholic and Protestant Churches of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1633, Peter Mohyla, an energetic scion of an aristocratic Moldavian family, became the head of the Kyivan Orthodox Church.
Mohyla’s tenure as the metropolitan marked the beginning of an important period in the history of the Ukrainian and Belorussian Church, characterized by reforms in religion and education. The learned circle of Petro Mohyla modernized the existing theological literature and introduced new genres such as collections of miracles and moral theology into the Orthodox use. To unify the liturgy and teaching of the Orthodox Church, Mohyla initiated a revision and publication of the “critical editions” of the main books of the Church such as the and the Missal (1629), the Orthodox Confession of Faith (1640), the Euchologion (1646). Trying to raise the status of the Orthodox Church in the Commonwealth, Mohyla and his circle closely followed the Catholic example of ecclesiastical modernization and even made steps to prepare the Orthodox Church in Ukraine for the second Union with the Catholic Church. Mohyla justified using Latin sources by saying that ‘there exist few Slavonic books on theology, and none at all on politics. Greek books are difficult to obtain, and they cost too much, while Latin books on these subjects are readily available (Charipova, 261). To address the problem of education, Mohyla founded the Kyivan Collegium modeled on the example of Jesuit academies in the Commonwealth in 1632. Changes in religious life also brought transformations in the religious art and architecture. New genres of theatrical plays on religious became popular and popularized by the Kyivan Collegium. The new influences became noticeable in iconography that emphasized the cult of the Mother of God and Marian piety.  
The followers of Petro Mohyla accepted fundamental works created during Mohyla’s timeline and developed new theological genres. The most prominent works produced by the generation that followed  Mohyla included collections of sermons by Lazar Baranovych (1620-1693), treatises on moral theology by Innocentyi Gizel (1600-1683), collections of miracles by Ioanykyi Galiatovs’kyi (1620-1688). This generation of religious scholars made a considerable influence on the Russian Orthodox Church by bringing new types of books to Russian markets and setting new standards for education, preaching and church discipline.",1620,1700,1101,812,Ievgeniia Sakal,2020-08-05 06:13:18.219 +0200,2020-08-10 00:56:11.375 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
945,Vasco-Aquitanian Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Vasco-Aquitanian religion is documented primarily through the epigraphic remains of votive dedications, inscribed contractual obligations and gifts establishing a relationship with a deity, erected by private and public individuals in the central and western Roman Pyrenees and northern and southern foothills and hinterlands of the range. The bulk of these dedications to local deities occurred in the first two centuries CE. We cannot determine the contours of the priestly hierarchy or the religious institutions of Vasco-Aquitanian religion as  no recorded priests (sacerdotes, flamines, or local offices) are known epigraphically. There are differences between religious features among the Pyrenean Aquitani and the Vascones of Hispania Tarraconensis, but many similarities. The bulk of our evidence comes from the Pyrenees for this religious group. The greatest concentration of Vasco-Aquitanian deities occurs in the territory of the town of Lugdunum Convenarum (mod. Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges). That town, said to be founded in 72 BCE by Pompey, features few Vasco-Aquitanian gods but primarily Roman deities. By contrast the hinterland of the town, where most of the industrial operations of the Convenae occurred, features the bulk of votive dedications to local deities with  Vasco-Aquitanian deities or Latin-named deities clearly masking local gods. Several of these deities, such as Fagus ""Beech Tree"", Sex Arbores ""The Six Trees"", Arixo (""oak"", cf. Basque hartiz ""oak""), Artehe (""Holm Oak"", cf. Basque arte),  Leherennus (""Pine"", cf. Basque leher), Erriapus (""The Stone One"", cf. Basque harri ""stone""), and Ageio are linked to sites of industry or traditional economic activities, such as silvopastoralism, pitch production, iron mining, and marble quarrying. There seems to be evidence of corporate worship of certain of these economic gods by individuals connected with large-scale industries, above all marble quarrying and iron mining. For example several collective dedications exist at or near the sites of work by those who seem to have been physically involved with that work: CIL XIII 1384 (Asque / Bigerriones): Ageio deo / pagani / Ferrarienses / ex voto ""To the god Ageio, the pagani Ferrarienses ('iron mining contract laborers' or 'residents of the iron-mining district') set this up to the god Ageio in fulfillment of a vow"", and  AE 1951, 233 (Saint-Beat / Lugdunum Convenarum): Deo / Erria/pe v(otum) s(olverunt) / marmo(rarii) / omnes ""All the marble workers fulfilled their vow to the god Erriapus."" Some scholars have conflated such gods with ""natural worship"" in the past without connecting it to similar economic motivations underpinning votive usage elsewhere in the Roman world. The votive dedications of the Convenae and other populations in the Roman Pyrenees, as elsewhere in the Mediterranean, reveal deities closely linked to the lived realities of their dedicants. The beliefs about and the mythologies of these gods are beyond access to us but perhaps remain alive in elements of Basque folklore.",100,400,1106,746,David Wallace-Hare,2020-08-05 17:08:09.231 +0200,2021-03-16 17:50:20.529 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
946,Nyingma (rnying ma),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Nyingma, or “Ancient” lineage refers to the oldest of the four major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. Distinguished from followers of the later Sarma (Tibetan: gsar ma) lineages, which includes the Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu, and later Gelug, Nyingma refers to those who adhere to the earliest (pre-tenth century) translations of Buddhist teachings arriving in Tibet, as well as a series of treasure (T: gter ma) text revealed from the eleventh century onwards. Renowned for their adherence to a range of esoteric, predominantly tantric Buddhist practices, as well as unorthodox behavior, Nyingma followers served as motivation for periodic reforms throughout Tibetan history, each allegedly “returning” to the ethical roots and meditative discipline of Indian Buddhism. 

According to the Nyingma lineage, the primordial teacher is Samantabhadra (T: kun tu bzang po). Depicted without clothing and vivid blue in color, he represents the untainted wisdom of the all Buddhas of the three times and ten directions. In human form, the Nyingma lineage finds its roots in the Indian master Padmasambhava (T: pad+ma 'byung gnas) who is credited with introducing the first coherent and comprehensive presentation of the Buddhist path to Tibet. He is often referenced along with Shantarakshita (Sansrkit: Śāntarakṣita), the great Indian pandit, and Vairotsana (T: bai ro tsa na), the great translator, delineating the three most important early Nyingma thinkers. The historical center of the lineage is found in Samye (T: bsam yas) monastery in central Tibet. Constructed in the eighth century, Samye monastery was the first successfully constructed monastery in Tibet. After years of wrestling with demons, King Trisong Detsen (T: khri srong lde btsan), requested Padmasambhava to subjugate the antagonistic demon, which he did, and the monastery was miraculously completed overnight. 

Renowned today for their erudite descriptions of the Great Completeness (T: rdzogs pa chen po) meditative system, the Nyingma lineage experienced a resurgence in the fourteenth century with the renowned scholar-yogi Longchen Rabjam (T: klong chen rab ‘byams). Longchenpa, as he is commonly referred to, both revealed new treasure teachings and consolidated much of the existent tantric materials found within the early Nyingma lineage. His extensive writings on topics such as the nine vehicles (T: theg pa dgu; a defining religious shema of the Nyingma, the subtle body, meditation practice, and most importantly the Great Completeness, revived the Nyingma lineage during and after his life. 

Extending across the Tibetan plateau to include all three Tibetan states (Utsang, Kham, and Amdo), as well as Bhutan and modern-day Indian state of Ladakh, the Nyingma lineage flourished in many sub-lineages throughout the centuries, resulting in a vibrant array of contemplative and scholarly practices.",700,1959,1129,782,Justin Kelley,2020-08-05 21:01:06.170 +0200,2020-08-14 07:09:49.817 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
948,Christianity in Ephesus,43,Religious Group (v6),"Groups of Jesus-followers (aka ""Christians"") in the city of Ephesus and its environs, in the second and third centuries of the Common Era, prior to the official recognition of Christianity as a state-sanctioned religious group. The earliest Jesus movement missionary connected with Ephesus is Paul, who is said to have resided in Ephesus in the mid-1st century CE and who provides evidence for an early ""church"" there. In the second century, traditions developed identifying a spot on the nearby Ayasoluk Hill as the burial place of apostle John; there developed a tomb cult that would eventually become an important Christian holy site and pilgrimage destination. By the end of the third century, Ephesus had grown into a central hub of the burgeoning Christian movement, famous for its associations with the apostles Paul and John, presaging its later place among the civic centers of imperial Christianity. 
Besides Paul’s letters, other early Christian texts connected with Ephesus include the pseudo-Pauline Pastoral Epistles, the Johannine Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, the Book of Revelation, Ignatius' Letter to the Ephesians, and the apocryphal Acts of John. The latter two sources are our best witnesses to second century Christianity in the area, though the contested provenance of the Acts of John renders its historical utility dubious. Collectively, our sources for early Christianity in Ephesus attest to a substantial, though still marginal, presence of Christian groups in the city in the first three centuries. Almost all of our earliest sources attest to conflict between groups associated with the city, suggesting that Christianity there was comprised of a diverse collection of groups. 
The partial and highly stylized nature of our earliest sources, however, frustrate attempts to discern reliable sociological information, especially whether and how Ephesian Christians were distinct from other Christian groups, Jews, and Greco-Roman polytheists. Scholars have sometimes suggested that an early Pauline strand of Christianity was ""overtaken"" by a competing Johannine tradition (see DRH entries on ""Pauline"" and ""Johannine"" Christianities for more on these groups), but our sources prevent any kind of clarity on that front. Utilizing material and literary evidence, Katherine Shaner has recently suggested that women and enslaved people played prominent roles in the earliest Christian communities in Ephesus. 
This entry combines reconstructions of general early Christian beliefs and practices (in all their diversity), supplemented by insights drawn from texts connected specifically with Ephesian history and culture.",120,300,1094,807,Travis Proctor,2020-08-05 22:58:22.825 +0200,2020-08-06 15:57:01.539 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
949,The Church of All Worlds,43,Religious Group (v6),"Church of All Worlds (CAW) began April 7, 1962 at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, when two freshman psychology students shared a glass of water. Inspiration for this sharing of water came from a science fiction book they had both read: Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein. In this book Valentine Michael Smith, a young human who was raised on Mars, experiences the ills our world and uses his training as a Martian to address them. In order to achieve this, he starts a church. That church was called the Church of All Worlds. These two college students, Lance Christie and Tim Zell (who now goes by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart), looked at this religion and thought “it was fiction so good is should be true,” and thus they engaged in the most holy of Martian traditions, water sharing. 

By 1963 they had officially started the Church of All Worlds. Over the following five decades the group grew to have major influence on alternative religion in America. Adding to their science fiction roots they adopted aspects of the growing environmental movement, western esoterism, and human potential psychology. They found themselves at the center of a number of the social movements that the 1960s and 70s have become famous for. They coined the term polyamory. They were one of the first (or the first according to some sources) group to refer to themselves proudly as “pagan.”. They helped develop many of the rituals and traditions that would become the Neo-Pagan tradition. They fought a battle with the IRS to become one of the first tax-exempt organizations to identify as part of this tradition. They published the “Green Egg,” one of the most important Neo-Pagan magazines. The founders even raised living unicorns at one point. 

The Church has also experienced many ups and downs. At its height in the late 90s, they numbered around 1200 due paying members, with many more coming their festivals, engaging in their rituals, and working alongside them in both their magazine, a number of store front locations and at ANNWN, their sacred land in Northern California. The Church still exists today though its membership is much smaller, with less than a hundred due paying members in the United States. Still, the group continues to attract new adherents, its founder, Oberon Zell, maintains a busy schedule of speaking engagements and writing projects. In 2004 Zell opened the Grey School of Wizardry, an online magick school self-consciously based on Hogwarts, from the Harry Potter novels. Showing that many still keep their science fiction roots close, remaining invested in a sense of play, creativity, and a keen eye for popular culture.",1963,2020,1096,806,Damian LanahanKalish,2020-08-06 05:54:37.487 +0200,2020-08-16 04:22:19.898 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
950,The Religious Society of Friends,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)
The Religious Society of Friends, better known by the once derogatory and later reclaimed moniker “Quakers,” are a historically Christian group. One of many small religious sects to emerge in the wake of the English Civil War, the Quakers formed under the inspiration of the teachings of George Fox, a weaver turned preacher who elevated the “priesthood of the believer” to a hitherto unseen extreme. Fox argued for the abolition of the priesthood (or the laity, as Friends might say), in favor of a Christian community modeled on Fox’s understanding of the early church, one in which all were called to ministry and equally able to communicate with a divine “Light Within.” Fox and the early Friends seem to have been a premillenarian sect who felt Christ’s return was immanent and prepared accordingly, but by the 1670s the Friends had begun to internalize the second coming and institutionalize in earnest. Friends became notorious throughout England for the uniqueness of their theological and social practices—worshipping in silence, eschewing paid ministers and tithes, refusing to use the “pagan” names of months and days, adopting plain clothes and the informal “thou” in place of the honorific “you,” refusing to doff hats for anyone but the Lord, and, most importantly, their refusal to swear oaths in courts of law (after Matthew 5:34) which led to their frequent imprisonment.
Even after the Friends were granted formal toleration in the Toleration Act of 1689, a number chose to immigrate to the New World, driven by economic and religious motivations. Though Friends began arriving in the Americas as early as 1655, they founded their most influential settlement in Pennsylvania (awarded as a charter to Quaker William Penn in 1681 to repay a lien owed his father), where Friends remained the dominant force in the legislature until 1756, when they resigned en masse rather than dedicate taxes for the French and Indian War, objecting on pacifist grounds. Though never a numerically significant portion of the American population, Friends assumed outsized importance in American religious history by spearheading a variety of social movements: The American abolition movement, women’s suffrage, Native American rights, and pacifist movements all have Quaker origins and inspirations.
A series of schisms split the American Quakers in the nineteenth century, following the trajectory of many Protestant denominations at the time. The most significant was the 1827 Orthodox-Hicksite split, the Hicksites rallying around the teachings of Elias Hicks, who taught that Jesus became Christ but was not born divine, and that any modern Friend who might follow Jesus’ example in discerning the will of the Inward Light within all. For Hicks, the Bible was valuable as one source among many attesting to God’s previous revelations but was not the unique word of God and should be subordinated to reason and experience. Orthodox Friends, by contrast, affirmed the traditional Christian beliefs that Christ was the sole Son of God who was sent to earth to redeem humanity by dying on the cross. Orthodox Friends increasingly integrated with other Protestant denominations in both theology and practice, while Hicksite Friends grew closer with other progressive denominations active in social movements. The split foreran the two most important Quaker bodies today, the liberal Friends General Conference (FGC) and evangelical Friends United Meeting (FUM). FGC Friends have maintained the distinctively quiet (“unprogrammed”) style of Quaker worship but are arguably post-Christian, while FUM meetings are effectively Protestant. The two groups share little with one another except competing claims to a shared spiritual lineage and the Quaker name itself. 
The Quakers were not historically known for missions after their initial proselytization efforts in the seventeenth century, but a series of successful international missions initiated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have led to large Quaker communities in Kenya, Burundi, Guatemala, and Bolivia. These international meetings are typically, though not invariably, affiliated with either the Evangelical Friends or the Friends United Meeting, and so more closely resemble other Protestant Christian churches than the more liberal FGC Friends. Over a third of the world’s Quakers live in Kenya, the likely provenance of the next stage of Quaker history.",1652,2020,1125,803,Andrew Taylor,2020-08-06 18:03:17.959 +0200,2023-02-27 17:07:01.866 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
952,Ethiopian Jews,43,Religious Group (v6),"A Jewish community of people who lived in Northwestern Ethiopia and shared a common language, culture, and history until a majority of the community emigrated to modern Israel in the 1980s and 1990s (1984-1991) in the aftermath of a series of social, political, and economic crises, commonly referred to as the Aliyah from Ethiopia. Approximately 150,000 Ethiopian Jews currently reside within Israel. 5,000 Ethiopian Jews remain in Northwest Ethiopia where they have waited over 20 years to migrate to Israel. Those who migrated to Israel during the aliyah have settled in a variety of cities within modern Israel where they have continued to maintain their ritual practices and cultivate new religious traditions and beliefs. Separated from Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jewish communities, Ethiopian Jews have cultivated their own ritual traditions, including dance, music, ideas about the Sabbath, and the practice of legal interpretation. In particular, debates and questions about Ethiopian Jews' knowledge of the Talmud or Oral Torah of Judaism persist with Israel's chief religious institution, the Rabbinate, refusing to categorize Ethiopian Jewish authorities, known as the kesim, as rabbis due to their perceived lack of knowledge of the Oral Torah. However, in 2018 the Israeli government formally recognized the kesim as the religious leaders of Ethiopian Jews and promised to put twenty kesim on the government payroll. Formal recognition of the kesim always involved instituted a government committee over the kesim which would supervise and regulate their activities. Some have criticized this attempt to formally recognize the kesim and argued that it will cause more problems and issues with the government now given the right and ability to survey and regulate Ethiopian Jewish authorities. As a result of these ongoing political complexities over the status of Ethiopian Jews, their legal status as Jews has and continues to be increasingly called into questioned and debated. In recent years, Ethiopian Jews living in Israeli cities have increasingly confronted social, economic, and political discrimination in the country which have led to widespread national protests and confrontations with authorities. While discrimination and marginalization remain persistent issues, Ethiopian Jews have increasingly integrated into Israeli institutions, including Israel's leading hi-technology companies, social services, and government agencies, with the first Ethiopian Jewish woman elected to a ministry position in May of 2020.",1980,2020,1104,816,Amanda Furiasse,2020-08-06 23:13:24.653 +0200,2020-08-15 03:42:23.852 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
953,Sachchai,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sachchai is a loosely organized group of believers who aim to heal their suffering and illnesses through the means of Bible study, ritual exorcism, and speaking in tongue. Sachchai is rapidly spreading across villages and towns in Nepal. Hundreds of thousands of believers have embraced it. More than ninety percent of the believers are women who mostly are from poor and low-caste backgrounds. Sachchai claims to be an inclusive, egalitarian, and universal group. People from any religious and cultural background are welcome and they do not need to abandon their past religions and cultures. But the believers are required to believe in Jesus and study the Bible. Other synchretist faith-based groups like Sachchai are also found in South Asia. For example, Christ-Bhakta followers in Tamil Nadu, India, who identify themselves as Christ-Bhakta Hindus, and Jesus Imandars in Bangladesh, who identify themselves as Isa-Muslims (Jørgensen 2008; Kuttiyanikkal 2014) . Both these groups study the Bible but do not disassociate themselves from their past religions.   

Sachchai was established by Christian evangelicals in the late 1970s in India but could not prosper until the first decade of the 21st century when it got fertile ground in Nepal. Extreme political instabilities, huge international labor migration of men, dire lack of public services, and, most importantly, rising domestic violence against women, all have contributed to the rapid expansion of Sachchai. Hindu nationalists and Christians in Nepal both have considered Sachchai as a threat to them.",1975,2020,1140,790,Amar BK,2020-08-06 23:48:59.994 +0200,2020-09-11 03:33:41.523 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Introductory remarks: The culture and religion of Iron Age Britain displays many similarities with other Celtic-speaking regions, including northern Britain, Gaul, Ireland, Celtiberia, Galatia, and Celtic-speaking regions of Continental Iron Age Europe. These similarities - as well as divergent beliefs and practices - were widely remarked upon by numerous Classical authors. In this timeframe, similarities in culture and religion were commented upon by Julius Caesar in De Bello Gallico (V, 14 and VI, 13) during his raids on southern Britain in 55 and 54 BCE; as well as by Strabo in his Geographica (IV, 5, 2) c. 23 BCE and other commentators. Primary evidence will be drawn from archaeology in Britain and Classical accounts, with useful comparative materials from related cultural regions given above.

957,Spartan Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ancient Spartans, known also as Spartiates, lived in the city of Sparta, a settlement located in the region of southwest Greece known as the ‘Peloponnesos’. Positioned between the between the Eurotas River and the Taygetos mountains, Sparta during the Archaic and Classical periods controlled a large territory that included the regions of Lakonia and Messenia. Having subjugated the native populations of these regions during a series of conflicts thought to have taken place during the 8th-7th centuries BCE, the Spartans instituted a system—attributed to the quasi-mythical Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus—by which a small caste of full-citizen Spartiates were supported by the unfree agricultural and commercial labor of oppressed non-Spartan inhabitants of Lakonia and Messenia (known as ‘perioikoi’ and ‘helots’). Uniquely unconstrained by agricultural or economic obligations, Spartiate males devoted the majority of their time to rigorous physical and military training from the age of seven onwards. The educational system at Sparta, supposedly another Lycurgan initiative, specialized in the cultivation of civic and martial virtues such as bravery, obedience, and self-control, as well as physical prowess and mental acumen; physical training for Spartiate women also existed to promote the generation of strong and healthy children. As a result of this system, the Spartans maintained one of the most powerful and respected armies in all of Greece during the Archaic and Classical periods, and it is this martial aspect of Spartan society that remains most well-known today. || 

Beyond the reputation of the Spartans as formidable warriors, however, many aspects of Spartan society remain shrouded in mystery. Little written evidence regarding Archaic and Classical Sparta has survived unto the present day, and of the ancient sources that do survive, very few of them record contemporary Spartan perspectives. François Ollier first coined the term ‘le mirage Spartiate’ to describe this conundrum of attempting to reconstruct Spartan society from the testimony of outsider perspectives, most of which postdate the period in question and present an idealized account of Spartan society. Much of the ancient evidence concerning Sparta comes either from the period of Roman Greece, when Sparta was greatly admired by the Roman Empire, or from the 5th century BCE, when Sparta and Athens were locked in a struggle for the supremacy of Greece. Fueled by the ideological conflict and the perceived insularity of ‘conservative’ Spartan society, 5th-century Athenian writers tended to project their feelings about Athens—whether positive or negative—onto the antithetical ‘blank canvas’ of Spartan society. || 

If reconstructing Spartan society remains a difficult task on its own terms, then reconstructing Spartan religion is even more challenging due to the scarcity of written evidence and the strong localizing tendencies of Greek religion. During the Archaic and Classical periods, each city-state in the Greek world practiced its own expression of a more universal ‘Greek religion’. Deeply embedded in a city-state’s civic institutions, these so-called ‘polis religions’ fused local religious traditions with aspects of Panhellenic belief and practice. In reconstructing Spartan ritual practices and festivals, every attempt has been made to temper the accounts of later writers such as Pausanias and Plutarch by turning to the testimony of archaeological evidence, particularly that excavated from Spartan sanctuaries and shrines under the auspices of the British School at Athens. In the absence of -emic sources concerning Spartan religious beliefs and cosmology, much of this material has been reconstructed from the testimony of early Greek poets such as Homer and Hesiod. ||",-800,-300,1142,809,Sarah M.

958,Society of Jesus,43,Religious Group (v6),"Revered and reviled. Saints or devils incarnate. These and other stark dichotomies have dogged the Jesuits throughout their nearly five-century history. That history was born with a second birth; that is, the conversion of a Basque nobleman after the battle of Pamplona in 1521. A cannonball struck the knees of Iñigo Lopez shattering them and his hopes for a career as a courtier. Yet, instead of crippling him, the injuries he sustained transported him into a whole new life, the life of the spirit. His meandering path in the life of religion brought him to unexpected places from Montserrat, to Jerusalem, to Barcelona, to Paris and ultimately to Rome; and to a surprising destiny: the founder and first Superior General of a religious order, the Society of Jesus.
Paul III officially approved of the Society on September 27, 1540 and in so doing ratified their first formula and institute in which the Jesuits laid out the plan for their common life. In that document the Jesuits commit themselves to a wide variety of ministries of the word including giving the Spiritual Exercises, striving for the progress of souls, partaking in works of charity, educating children and the illiterate. In addition to these pursuits, the Jesuits took a special fourth vow, beyond the three traditional evangelical vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, of obedience to the pope to undertake missions anywhere in the world. It was in these latter two capacities that the Jesuits became most famous. 
As the Society rapidly grew from ten to one thousand from 1540 to 1556 so too did its commitment to education. While they were involved in some form of teaching from the outset, their first formal foray into schooling for primarily lay students began in 1548 with the foundation of their school at Messina, Sicily. After that date, schools quickly sprang up in nearly every city where there were Jesuits, and practically every place that did not have a Jesuit school wanted one. Devoted to a rigorous humanist education in the classics, grammar, rhetoric, and other burgeoning arts such as history, while maintaining their instruction in faith and good morals the Jesuits became the teachers par excellence of the early modern period. Indeed, students of the caliber of Moliere, Voltaire, Descartes, and many other attended their schools, which helped earn them their reputation for educational excellence. Even contemporaries, such as Francis Bacon, commended the Jesuit efforts in education in his own writings on education reform.  
Their schools were not limited to the confines of Europe. In fact, schooling was a major part of their missionary endeavors where they taught both Europeans and indigenous populations alike. The Jesuits were adept missionaries, with a unique style of accommodation. Their educational background in languages encouraged them to learn the languages of indigenous populations and prepare grammar books for those languages in an effort to teach others. Jesuits explored and frequently wrote about the new cultures they interacted with as well as the new environments, flora, and fauna they encountered. As a result, they published many ethnographies, but also letters that they sent on an annual basis to Rome, known as the Jesuit Relations. These letters electrified European audiences thirsting for knowledge of faraway lands and inspired many young men to become Jesuits. 
Outside of these two ventures the Jesuits also excelled in preaching, the study of theology, and even as patrons of the arts. They produced some of the greatest theologians of the time including Francisco Suarez and Robert Bellarmine. Similarly, they had relationships with the greatest artists of the day such as Michelangelo, Bernini, and even numbered the great painter and art theorist Andrea Pozzo among their own.
Still, wherever the Jesuits succeeded they also seemed to draw harsh criticism. This was especially true in their missionary endeavors where detractors accused them of using the mission fields for the purpose of acquiring land and riches. Similarly, as theologians, many of their ideas became controversial. Dominicans and later Jansenists (including Pascal) accused them of neo-Pelagianism on account of their insistence on the role of free will in salvation. 
These criticisms, added to various political intrigues, fueled the flames that eventually led to the general suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773. Over the two hundred and thirty three year history of the “Old Society” the Jesuits achieved many major accomplishments and earned the ire of many detractors. To some they were saints to others devils incarnate. They were reviled as much as revered.",1540,1773,498,799,Thomas SantaMaria,2020-08-08 02:16:19.454 +0200,2020-09-14 17:16:30.487 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Introductory remarks: The dates for this timeframe extend from Caesar's raids on south-east Britain in 55 and 54 BCE through much of the Roman occupation of Britain, which was punctuated by a decade of British independence between 286 - 296 CE. In this era, we see the introduction of Roman military power and the gradual conquest of Britain. Aspects of Roman culture and religion are increasingly visible, and generally accessible to members of native British tribes. This was particularly the case in areas where British rule and administration were unavoidable or uncontested, and/or where tribes allied themselves with the Roman presence for benefits of trade and material culture, as well as military protection. Not all tribes participated to a high degree, however, and as a result we see varying zones of Romanization or assimilation. 
The situation on the ground was varied and complex. Some British tribe offered little or no resistance, many of whom were located in the south-east of Britain (Corieltauvi, Catuvellauni, Dubunni, Atrebates, Cantiaci, Regni) as well as the Demetae in south-west Wales and the Dumnonii in the south-west peninsula. Hostile tribes offered strong opposition and revolt, some of which took the Romans many years to overcome (sometimes only containing rather conquering them); these included three tribes in Wales (Deceangli, Orovices, Silures) and the Durotriges in the south of Britain. More mixed responses and interactions, including very large military campaigns, involved the varied smaller tribes in the federations of the Brigantes, the Iceni and the Belgae.
Some tribes remained hostile to Rome and only participated as much as was necessary to preserve their territory and population. As a result, for the sake of this query, we must envision zones where Romanization was accepted and zones where it had less or little effect. Therefore, the data provided below will include answers and notes that apply to tribes whose religion continued on as before (as much as was possible), mixed areas of influence, and areas of higher Roman influence. During this era we also see the beginning of the slow and gradual introduction of Christianity into the region, possibly in the third century and definitely by the fourth centuries, by way of contact with traders and artisans arriving from other regions. Christianity was one of several religions introduced to Britain from the eastern part of the region, including those dedicated to the veneration of deities like Cybele, Isis and Mithras. For much of this era, Christianity would have been a minority religion amongst the native British; the rate of Christianization amongst Romans would have been higher (although Roman paganism and syncretic Romano-Celtic paganism would have been present throughout). Christianity experienced a slow and steady growth in the Empire throughout the 3rd century, and was decriminalized in 260 CE. The presence of these religious groups and practices are marked (prior to presentation of data) as follows: NB [Native British Practices, as seen in the First Timeframe], RC [Mixed / Syncretic Romano-Celtic practices], and RP [Roman or Romanized practices]. There will also be reference to minority religions such as Mystery religions of eastern origin involving the veneration of Cybele, Isis and Mithras [ER], as well as early Christianity [EC].",-55,286,992,618,Ryan Johnson,2020-08-08 04:06:48.449 +0200,2020-08-08 04:09:21.431 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
960,Bön (Bon),43,Religious Group (v6),"The word ‘Bön’ (Tib. Bon) represents a complicated and contested term, carrying various meanings across time, space, and different groups. Presently it usually refers to the more specifically called Yungdrung Bön (g.Yung drung Bon), literally ‘Eternal Bon’, on which this entry focuses – a religious tradition academically mostly taken as a school of Tibetan Buddhism. The other recognised main schools are: Geluk (dGe lugs), Nyingma (rNying ma), Kagyü (bKa’ rgyud), Sakya (Sa skya), and Jonang (Jo nang). Yet, Bön has historically maintained a strong non-Buddhist and minority identity, accentuating own appellation bön in opposition to Buddhism, chö (chos). Yungdrung Bön is currently spread, as the other schools, in the culturally Tibetan parts of the PRC – with largest communities in East Tibet (Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai Provinces); in the Himalayas: Nepal (Mustang, Dolpo, Kathmandu), following the post-1959 exile also in India (Himachal Pradesh, thinly in Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Ladakh), Bhutan, and growing globally: in Europe (with a monastery in France), USA, Canada, Mexico, Mongolia, and venturing into South-east Asia. 
Attested meanings of the term bön refer to: (1) ‘bönpo’ (bon po) ritual specialists conducting funerary rites and invocations of deities in the Tibetan Empire (7th-9th century) controlling a great part of Central Asia, with ‘bön’ likely denoting ‘ritual’; (2) all historical and contemporary Tibetan religious notions and practices that do not derive from Buddhism and Indian influences, i.e. mainly popular religion encompassing traditions sometimes labelled ‘shamanism’; in an extended understanding non-Buddhist elements of Tibetan culture, a notion currently popular in Tibet and propagated by the PRC (along with strong Chinese historical impacts); (3) Yungdrung Bön; (4) (lha)bön ((lha) bon), or sipé lhabön (srid pa’i lha bon), local traditions generally lacking Buddhist influence unrelated to Yungdrung Bön, centred on mundane rituals, worshipping a range of own divinities, found in small areas of East Tibet and the Himalayas (mainly Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh). 
Bönpos, adherents of Yungdrung Bön, have asserted own succession of the Imperial bön, which they regard as an independent Tibetan autochthonous religious system, gradually suppressed by Buddhism (officially adopted by the Tibetan Empire in the 7th century) and a predecessor of bön (2), (3), (4). According to historical evidence, Yungdrung Bön begun crystallising in the 11th century under the influence of Buddhism during its second diffusion in Tibet, developing monasticism and adopting other Buddhist features. Yungdrung Bön has thus shared cosmology, soteriological goals (awakening), and key features of ritual and spiritual practice with Tibetan tantric Buddhism, but has maintained more Tibetan non-Buddhist elements. The non-Buddhist identity is very strong and derives from own sources of tradition and lineages of power and teachings: divine founder of the religion Tönpa Shenrap Mibo (sTon pa gShen rab mi bo), claimed to significantly predate Buddha Shakyamuni and hail from the Zhangzhung (Zhang zhung) kingdom in West Tibet; own canon: voluminous Ka (bKa’, ‘The Word’ or ‘Teachings’) and Katen (bKa’ rten,  ‘Support of Teachings’) collections; distinct iconography and details of material culture; also deliberate inversions of Buddhist categories (for instance anti-clockwise circumambulation).",1000,2020,1107,736,Anna Sehnalova,2020-08-08 16:38:52.622 +0200,2020-08-21 16:24:56.212 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
961,Romanian Orthodox Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Romanian Orthodox Church (henceforth ROC) is an Eastern Christian denomination. It represents the largest religious group in Romania (86.45% in 2011). Although the first evidence of Christianization of modern-day Romanian territories (Lower Moesia) dates back to the 3rd century, this entry’s time span runs from the achievement of the status of autocephalous Metropolis of Romania in 1885 – following the creation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 – up to the present day. The Metropolis of Romania was eventually raised to the rank of Patriarchate (its current jurisdiction) in 1925. The ROC is structured in Romania (thus excluding its dioceses abroad) into twenty-nine dioceses, fourteen of which have been established since 1990 (seven have been just re-opened after the communist leadership had disbanded them and another seven have been newly established). The Patriarch is the head and representative of the Romanian Orthodox Church, but decision making is the prerogative of the Holy Synod, which meets twice per year. The Holy Synod, which is the highest authority of the ROC, is formed by six Metropolitanates, sixteen Archbishoprics and thirteen Bishoprics with jurisdiction in Romania, plus some representatives for Romanian Orthodox communities abroad, including the Republic of Moldova. On a local scale, Bishoprics and Archbishoprics are divided in Protopopiates and, eventually, in parishes, which are the smallest units (Tateo 2020: 62).
The theological framework organizing the orthodoxy and the orthopraxis of the ROC is the same of the other eight Eastern Orthodox churches, which are all autocephalous but in full communion with one another. The Romanian Orthodox faithful worship with particular devotion Saint Nicholas, Saint Parascheva, Saint Filofteia, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saints Constantin and Elena, and Saint Dimitrie. The Orthodox Easter is the most important feast day of the year, while weekly services revolve around the Sunday mass. Pilgrimage to monasteries is a crucial form of religious practice which gathers thousands of believers every year: the Saint Parascheva is the largest one and takes place at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Iaşi on October 14th. The most popular Orthodox monasteries in Romania are Putna, Moldoviţa, Suceviţa, Voroneţ, Prislop, Cernica, and Sihastria.

962,Amdo Gelukpa,43,Religious Group (v6),"Amdo is a vast region on the Sino-Tibetan borderlands, which includes parts of Kokonor, South Gansu, and North Sichuan. Amdo is occupied by diverse communities, including Tibetan, Mongol, Monguor, Chinese and Turkic Muslims, etc. In the thirteenth century, Tibetan Buddhism developed thrivingly in Amdo during the reign of the Mongol Empire. As the middle ground between Tibet and China, Amdo became a critical cultural nexus of diverse cultures. In this context, Tsongkhapa, the Geluk School's founder, was born in Amdo. Starting from the fourteenth century, the Geluk School spread widely in Amdo. Because of the Khoshut Mongols' patronage after the late sixteenth century, the Gelukpa power rose promptly in Amdo. From the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, the development of the Gelukpa power in Amdo was directly related to the geopolitical policy of the Qing dynasty. Along with the Manchus and Mongols' patronage, the center of Amdo Gelukpas gradually moved from South Gansu to Kokonor. This significant phenomenon about Amdo Gelukpas was related to the westward movement of the Qing frontier policy. The development of the Gelukpa power in Amdo has several characteristics. Many Geluk monasteries took over institutional and religious legacies from other religious sects in Amdo, especially from the Sakya School. Along with the expansion of the Gelukpas in Amdo after the fifteenth century, many Amdo Buddhist communities converted to the Geluk School; however, they still preserved some original traditions and social practices in the pre-Geluk period. One of the most significant traits is the close connection between the Buddhist reincarnation system and local aristocratic power. It is widely known that the Sakya School's inheritance system is mainly based on kinship, especially the relationship between uncle and nephew. Because of the Mongol Empire's sponsorship, many Sakyapa priests and followers moved to Amdo and promptly dominated the region. After that, they established powerful local clans and monastic communities by practicing inheriting the Sakya School's lineage. In so doing, either monastic priests or local governors in the region were usually chosen from those families affiliated with the Sakya School. As both patrons and priests shared the same lineage, the political and religious powers tied together closely in Amdo. After these families gradually converted to the Geluk School after the fifteenth century, they still followed the inheritance system based on the patron-priest concept of the Sakya tradition, in which kinship played a critical role (See: Kung, 2018.). This unique phenomenon of the unity of politics and religion based on kinship profoundly influenced the historical development of Amdo Gelukpas until the early twentieth century. For instance, the Tenth Panchen Lama also held the Sakya lineage of the Khön Family.",1400,2000,1109,819,Ling-Wei Kung,2020-08-08 23:20:59.302 +0200,2020-09-10 02:46:26.144 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
963,The Knights Templar,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Knights Templars, or the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, were a Christian religious military order founded in the early twelfth century whose history is inextricably linked to the crusades. Originally founded to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land in the decades after the First Crusade from danger as they crossed through Muslim-controlled areas, the organisation soon expanded its duties. The order’s knights, those men who were highly skilled in military warfare (at most around 10%), came to play an important role in the defence of the Crusader States, while non-combatant members managed a large economic structure throughout Christendom, making use of innovative banking techniques. 

All took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and promised to devote themselves to God's service just as members of other religious orders did. Its constitution guaranteed the organisation’s structure form the mid-twelfth century onwards, at the top of which stood the Grand Master, initially stationed in Jerusalem (while under Christian control) and later in Acre. He was elected for life and assisted by other high-ranking members, including the Grand Commander and Marshal. Directly below were the provincial preceptors of the Templar territories who commanded the sergeants (or 'servientes'), non-elite members who had usually joined from the lower social classes and supported the knights on the battlefield or served as craftsmen or labourers. There were also priest-brothers within the Order who were responsible for the spiritual needs of all members. Both elite and non-elite members came from all over western Europe. 

They initially found support among many secular and religious leaders, who made significant donations to the order in aid of their cause, thereby allowing the order to grow significantly and acquire great wealth. However, the tide began to turn at the end of the thirteenth century. At the end of the thirteenth century, little remained of the Crusader States which had been established nearly two centuries earlier and many resented the order’s significant power. Finally, in 1307 King Philip IV of France order the arrest of every Templar in France, falsely accusing them of immorality and heresy. This move gained the support of Pope Clement V and led to the violent persecution and death of many members.",1119,1312,1110,811,Emma Zürcher,2020-08-09 14:11:33.811 +0200,2020-08-13 15:12:27.359 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
964,Baul Fakirs of Bengal,43,Religious Group (v6),"Baul Fakir (Bengali: bāul phakir) is a phrase used to describe decentralized and non-sectarian communities of sadhus, fakirs, and artists who most often come from either Hindu (most often Vaiṣṇava but sometimes Śaiva or Śākta) and Muslim families.

Bāul Fakirs are generally decentralized as a society, and authority is organized according to various lines of descent from a guru or murshid (both guru and murshid are used synonymously among Bāul Fakirs). Gurus, their students, and their devotees (bhaktas) meet together during periodic gatherings called sādhusaṅga, “gathering of adepts,” where formal meals are held and decisions are often made on various issues of interest to the wider community of Fakirs (also called sādhaks or sādhus) and Fakirānis (also called sādhikās); these gatherings are often not only attended by Bāuls but also Hindu Tantric practitioners (tāntrikās) and followers of Sufi pīrs.

Bāul Fakirs of all stripes are distinguished by their great reverence for the songs of Lālan Fakir (d. 1890, also commonly rendered Lalon Sai or Lalon Shah). Lālan is especially known for his criticism of sectarian religion or “birth group” (jāt) in his songs, early versions of which were later committed to writing and recorded in the notebooks of the celebrated poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941). However, respect is also accorded to other important Bāul Fakiri poets, such as Pāñju Khondakār (1851-1914, also Pāñju Śāh), an associate of Lālan’s who seems to have contributed to the latter’s understanding of Islamic esoteric themes as well as his musical style of bhāb-saṅgīt “music for reflection.” The songs of Duddu Shah (1841-1911), one of Lālan’s direct disciples, as well as those of a wide variety of other artists as well as independent compositions are also commonly performed, but Lālan’s songs are often given preeminence at most festivals in Bangladesh, due in large part to his cultural status and familiarity. In West Bengal, however, the tradition appears to be more decentralized, and the songs of other Bāul poets such as Bhabā Pāglā (d. 1984) and Rāj Kr̥ṣṇa (1869-1946) as well as independent compositions are at least as prevalent as the songs of Lālan.

The lyrics of Bāul songs accordingly contain references not only to Hindu Purāṇas but also to Sufi themes or symbols that relate to striving for the attainment (siddhi) of embodied self-realization, and to this end refer to practices as varied as reflecting on cosmology as expressed in terms of the Arabic alphabet and privately practicing sexual rites derived from medieval Tantric literature and syncretic oral tradition. The emphasis on the physical body has also led some scholars to view the community as having much in common with Lokāyata and Cārvāka beliefs on materialism.",1800,2020,1111,776,Keith Cantu,2020-08-09 21:01:56.144 +0200,2020-08-17 23:18:27.243 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
965,Pachomian Monasticism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Pachomian monastic federation was a group of ultimately eleven monasteries, including two women's monasteries, affiliated under centralized leadership in Upper Egypt in the fourth to sixth centuries CE.  

The founder and central figure, Pachomius (c. 292-346), was born to a pagan family.  During his time serving in the Roman imperial army, he was inspired by the kind treatment he received from Christians, and ultimately embarked on an ascetic life.  He apprenticed himself to a local ascetic, after whose death he began his own community of ascetics.  After an unsuccessful first attempt, he established a monastery at Tabennesi (c. 323), the first of the monasteries that either were established or joined his federation over the course of the fourth century.  

After Pachomius’s death, there was a struggle to establish succession, but ultimately two more strong leaders, Theodore (d. 368) and Horsiesius (d. c. 387), took the reins and kept the federation thriving during their lifetimes.  Most of the primary source material we have dates to these eras.  We have much less data concerning the following century and a half, but the Pachomian federation appears to have continued during this period.  Sometime between 537 and 548, the Roman emperor Justinian I supplanted the Monophysite Pachomian leader Abraham with a Chalcedonian replacement, at which time many monks fled, effectively ending the existence of the Pachomian community.  

This group is sometimes described as the first Christian cenobitic monastic community, but this characterization is not strictly correct.  It was certainly the largest and most organized up to its time, but many others had been practicing a semi-removed ascetic and communal lifestyle for years already. For example, at least three of the eleven monasteries in the federation were not founded by the Pachomians, but joined the federation after independent origins.  The federation’s innovation instead came in its extensive organization in part facilitated by the Pachomian Rule, which provided a practical guide that helped in the regulation and functioning of the community.

The Pachomian legacy’s lasting influence is seen in other Christian cenobitic enterprises including Shenoute’s monastic community in Upper Egypt and Benedict of Nursia’s monastic Rule.",323,548,1112,818,Tola Rodrick,2020-08-09 22:30:33.638 +0200,2020-08-18 00:31:58.385 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
966,"Naqshbandī Order, Naqshbandī Tarīqa, Naqshbandīyyah, Khwājagān,",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Naqshbandī Order refers to a range of Sufi brotherhoods beginning in Central Asia in the 14th century c.e. and spreading geographically through offshoots such as the Naqshbandī Mujaddidī in South Asia during the 17th century and the Khâlidī branches beginning in the 19th century within the Ottoman Empire. The namesake of the order Bahāʾ al-Dīn Naqshband was born in 1318 c.e. and died in 1389 c.e. in a village near Bukhara known as Qasr ʿĀrifān and studied under the Khwājagān Sufi master Amīr Kulal. One of the common identifying features that distinguish Naqshbandī order from others is it’s Silsila, or the chain of transmission of its teachings. While most Sufi orders trace the chain of transmission from the prophet Muḥammad through the fourth Caliph and first Shīʿī imam ‘Alī ibn ʾAbī Ṭālib, the Naqshbandi trace their teaching through the first Caliph Abu Bakr Al-Ṣadīq. This is known as the Naqshbandī “Golden Chain” (Ar. Silsilat al-dhahab). Another unique feature of Naqshbandī orders is the practice of “silent recitation of God’s name” (dhikr-khafī) also known as “dhikr of the heart” (dhikr al-qalb) as opposed to “vocal dhikr (dhikr-i jahrī)” or “dhikr of the tongue” (dhikr al-lisan). The practice of silent dhikr combined with an aversion to musical audition (samāʿ) represent the “sober” rather than “intoxicated” expression of Sufism that characterizes the Naqshbandī orders. Finally, the Naqshbandī orders are characterized by a tendency toward social and political engagement. This is articulated in Bahā’ al-Dīn Naqshband’s preference for “companionship” (suhbat) over isolation (khalwat), and the principle of “solitude in the crowd” (Per. khalwat dar anjuman) which stressed that followers need not abandon their trades or economic activity for the sake of spiritual pursuits reflecting a Malamati Sufi attitude toward “livelihood” (kasb) prevalent in Central Asia. Along with another of Naqhband’s eleven principles--“travelling in one’s homeland” (safr dar watn)--Naqshbandi Sufis were encouraged to actively engage in society which may be seen from  ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar’s (1404-1490) land-holdings and influence in Timurid politics, to the prominent role of the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya in resisting the Russian Empire’s expansion into the Caucasus during the 18th and 19th centuries.",1318,2020,1113,757,Adam Tyson,2020-08-10 08:42:31.607 +0200,2020-08-15 02:25:38.942 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
967,Unitarian Universalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"In the United States, the American Unitarian Association and Universalist Church of America merged in 1961 to form the Unitarian Universalist Association. Although Unitarians and Universalists were nominally Christian denominations, the Unitarian Universalists subsequently adopted the principles of free faith, in which each member unites in seeking truth and affirms each other's worth without the guidance of a particular doctrine or divinity. Now described as a liberal religious movement or post-Christian, Unitarian Universalists hold many different theological opinions and operate as a radically non-creedal body. There is a wide diversity of congregational structures and organizations and each group may self-describe as a church, society, fellowship, or temple, among other identifiers. Each Unitarian Universalist congregation is distinct in tone and content of worship, even within the same city, but each is guided by the seven Principles and six Sources. The Principles serve as a uniting guide and affirm the inherent worth and dignity of every person; justice, equity, and compassion in human relations; acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth; a free and responsible search for truth and meaning; the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process without congregations and in society at large; the goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all; and respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are part. The Sources include direct experience, words and deeds of prophetic people, wisdom from the world’s religions, Jewish and Christian teachings to love our neighbors, humanist teachings and the guidance of reason and science, and spiritual teachings drawn from Earth-centered traditions. As a result, congregants draw from religious traditions such as Christianity or Judaism; spiritual practices of meditation, yoga, and connection to nature; and other influences including Paganism and New Age beliefs. Unitarian Universalists express strong commitment to social justice and action. They contend that spirituality and community extend beyond the walls of the congregation and must be lived in the world, and this message has spread beyond the borders of North America. The International Council of Unitarians and Universalists provides a network of organizations worldwide, including congregations throughout Africa; Europe and the UK; Australia and New Zealand; India, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Indonesia; the Caribbean; and in Central and South America. However, the tradition remains deeply affiliated with the West, as estimates indicate over 60% of Unitarian Universalists are in the United States and approximately 30% in Europe.",1825,2020,1123,813,Courtney Applewhite,2020-08-10 18:22:07.513 +0200,2020-08-15 22:35:31.119 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
968,"Anabaptist Mennonites in North America, 1683-2021",43,Religious Group (v6),"Mennonites are a religious group that arose out of the Radical Reformation of the broader Protestant Reformation in Western Europe in the early sixteenth century. They were called Anabaptists, “rebaptizers,” by religious and political authorities who persecuted them for baptizing adults upon their confession of faith rather than baptizing infants, which was the legislated practice of the time. In north Germany and the Netherlands, Roman Catholic priest Menno Simons renounced his position in 1536 and became an influential Anabaptist leader. Mennonites take their name from him.

Anabaptist Mennonites fled persecution and migrated throughout Western Europe. Mennonites in the Swiss and south German territories fled further west into Germany and France, and in 1683 the first group immigrated to North America in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Many more followed, finding the Quaker William Penn’s offers of land and religious freedom appealing. The north German and Dutch Mennonites fled further east in a later wave of migration during this time. Mennonite migration to Canada occurred in the late 18th century from Pennsylvania in southern Ontario due to the Revolutionary War, as Mennonites generally hold strong convictions about practicing nonviolence. In the late nineteenth century, Russian Mennonites migrated to Kansas, Nebraska and Manitoba. In the early twentieth century, some Canadian Mennonites migrated to Mexico.

Anabaptist Mennonites range from conservative to progressive. Those on the most conservative end have isolated themselves from the surrounding culture to the extent of not driving cars or using electricity, dressing in distinctive homemade attire and maintaining their own language (often, a low German dialect called Pennsylvania Dutch). Those on the most progressive end interact with the surrounding society to the point of not being recognizably different, participating in government leadership and undergoing training at non-Mennonite public and private educational institutions. 

Mennonites in North America today live in nearly every state and province. They typically share common beliefs and values such as service, nonviolence, simplicity and an emphasis on community. In principle, Mennonites are not religious affiliated by birth, but voluntarily enter the community of faith by free choice. Because of this, any person can join the Mennonites regardless of having Anabaptist Mennonite ancestors.",1683,2021,1115,820,Sarah Bixler,2020-08-10 23:21:50.850 +0200,2021-07-21 15:32:49.055 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
969,Adi Dravida/Valluva Sakya Buddhism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Adi Dravida movement was an early-20th century Tamil Paraiyar-caste [Dalit] Buddhist community founded by the Tamil thinker-activist Iyothee Thass (1845-1914) and overseen by his organization, the Dravida Mahajana Sabha, during Thass's lifetime. Valluva Sakya Buddhism, the label by which Thass sought recognition for the Adi Dravida movement in the broader Buddhist world, was founded on a reading of Tamil history that positioned the Paraiyar caste, and specifically the Valluva Sakya subgroup of Paraiyars identified as descendents of Śakyamuni Buddha himself, as a class of religious specialists in a pre-Sanskritic [i.e., Dravidian], Tamil Buddhist society. Consonant with important cultural and intellectual trends in the early-modern Tamil country, which focused on the non-Sanskritic roots of ancient Tamil civilization, Thass's Adi Dravida movement was the first movement in the Tamil country to connect a Dravidian-focused reading of Tamil sociocultural history to a discrete program of caste reform and Paraiyar community activism, the hub of which was Thass's newspaper, ""(Oru Paisa) Tamiḻaṉ"" (""One Paisa Tamilian"").  While at its peak the Adi Dravida movement boasted bustling communities in the Tamil country, Ceylon, Burma, and South Africa, Thass's death in 1914 led to the gradual decline of the Adi Dravida movement, and by the late 1920s most of the Adi Dravida activist community had adopted the rationalist-atheist Dravidianist model of anti-caste activism associated with E.V. ""Periyar"" Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement (suyamariyātai iyakkam). Although Thass's Adi Dravida Buddhism is no longer a major active community tradition, its influence can be observed in several realms of modern Tamil public society. First, the term ""adi dravida"", originally popularized by Thass's movement and taken up in E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement, became an official Tamil Nadu state government designation for Scheduled Caste communities, and remains a common label for these groups in present-day Tamil Nadu. Second, the surge of interest in recovering Dalit histories associated with Subaltern Studies and the formation of radical Dalit social activist groups in the latter half of the 20th century, in particular Tholkappiyan Thirumavalavan's Viduthalai Ciruthaigal Katchi (""Liberation Panthers Party""), a Tamil Dalit political party that follows Thass and Periyar in connecting the project of Dalit liberation with the project of Tamil cultural regeneration through the de-Sanskritization of Tamil society.",1891,1940,1117,822,Collin Sibley,2020-08-11 19:49:28.263 +0200,2020-08-23 08:04:37.118 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
970,Cult of Isis (Mysteries of Isis),43,Religious Group (v6),"Unlike many other mystery cults in the Ancient World, the Cult of Isis capitalize on its exotic, Egyptian appeal. In this henotheistic cult, Isis, an attractive female figure, mother of Horus, and devoted wife to Osiris in the narratives, becomes the supreme deity alongside Osiris and Divine Providence that offers one solution to the theological crisis of the 2nd century AD (Gasparini). Her association to Greek and Roman goddesses ranged from Artemis to Aphrodite, as de Witt points out: in the Classical period Herodotus makes Isis equivalent to Demeter as a fertility goddess, but by the Empire Plutarch states that Isis was Mut and Atyhri as well as Athena. Elsewhere, Artemis and Isis were associated together. An aretalogy, moreover from Kyme, Asia Minor has Isis controlling even Fate whom even the normal Graeco-Roman gods obey. Finally, in Corinth, Isis becomes a goddess of the sea and trade, and the festival Isidis Navigium is celebrated for the beginning of the sailing season, and the celebration even entered the Roman Fasti (calendar) during the Empire. 
Turning to the myth of Isis in the Graeco-Roman world, no other literary texts gives a complete narrative than Plutarch’s de Iside et Osiride. Even Egyptologists, such as Gwyn Griffiths and Hani, refer to Plutarch’s text and consider him a good scholar on religious history. Furthermore, the cult of Isis appears in many Greek and Latin inscriptions and it also features prominently in book eleven of the novel Metamorphoses of Apuleius, where Lucius in the form of the ass enters the cult of Isis, is initiated, experiences a religious encounter with Osiris, and recovers his true human body. In the soteriological myth of the cult, Plutarch outlines how Isis resurrects Osiris who was dismembered under the moon and killed by Typhon (Sett). Isis manages to put the pieces of Osiris back together save his phallus – scholars have offered many attempts to solve this part of the myth, including that Isis knew of Osiris’ adultery with Nephthys. From the myth, comes the idea from Egyptian theology that Osiris is the judge of the dead, who, if the deceased’s heart is lighter than a feather, would allow the deceased into his blessed and eternal abode. Isis becomes the benefactor of mankind, and the clear implication of the general narrative is that devotees of the cult of Isis had hope in life after death and that Isis may raise them up like Osiris. Thus, it comes to pass that, as Witt notes, the cult of Isis develops a priesthood, festivals days, its own calendar, and a litany of sacred texts, such as the Andros Hymn and aretalogies that are found throughout the Mediterranean world. In the hymn, Isis gives the holy word (hieros logos) whose symbol is the linen garb to those who are initiated into her mysteries. 
The cult itself might have entered the Greek world during the Classical period, when the Athenian Assembly gave permission to some Egyptians to establish a temple to Isis in the Piraeus, as Simms has noted. From there on, in the Hellenistic Period, the Ptolemies – Greek rulers of Egypt – who used both Osiris and Isis to legitimize their pharaonic rule continue to spread cult activity primarily in Alexandria. Ptolemy I Soter was said to have invited a Timotheus to syncretize the Egyptian cult with Greek ideas, based on the Eleusian mysteries and Demeter worship (Witt). The Ptolemies and their wives, such as Arisinoe II, would continue to use the cult in order to establish their political authority by associating themselves with Osiris and Isis. From Alexandria, the cult spread to the rest of the Greek world and arrived to Delos. Scholars have traced that the cult’s arrival to South Italy originated from Delos when merchants were forced to flee due to conflict with the Seleuccids. In Italy, the cult can be found relatively early in the 3rd century BC in the Greek speaking portions – Sicily and Magna Graecia through numismatic and archaeological evidence, such as temples at Puteoli and Pompeii (Rüpke). From there, in the 1st century BC, the cult of Isis enters Rome under Sulla, and the Pontifex Maximus Metellus funded the construction of an Isis shrine (Iseum Metellinum). The cult, however, did not enjoy immediate success. Among the non-aristocratic classes, the cult offered an alternative and a challenge of the authority of the Senate in competing with the gods of Jupiter and Venus (Rüpke). The Roman Senate sought to ban the cult activities in the 50s and 40s BC and political violence involving factions of Pompey and Clodius involved members of the cult of Isis. During the Civil Wars, Antony and Cleopatra fashioned themselves as Osiris and Isis which led to Octavian, after his victory at Actium in 31 BC, to prohibit the cult from entering the pomerium of Rome. The hostility towards the cult reached its pinnacle in Tiberius when in AD 19, a Roman by the name of Mundus seduced a married Roman matron Paulina with the aid of the priests of the temple of Isis. Upon investigation, Tiberius banned the cult, destroyed the temple, crucified the priests, and banished Mundus into exile. From there, under Caligula and Nero, the cult of Isis enjoyed prestige and became one of the most popular mystery cults throughout the Mediterranean until the arrival of Mithraism and Christianity. With Theodosius edict to close all pagan temples in AD 394, the fate of the cult was pretty much sealed, although there is some evidence to suggest that in certain peripheral areas the cult lasted until the 6th century AD.",-323,500,132,733,Juan Dopico,2020-08-11 23:06:52.508 +0200,2020-08-15 19:42:12.300 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
971,Gāṇapatya,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Gāṇapatya Sampradāya denotes a cluster of religious denominations whose worship and devotional systems are centered upon Gaṇeśa (Ganapati), the elephant-headed son of deities Śiva and Pārvatī. Members of the sampradāya are also referred to as Gāṇapatyas. Most modern Hindus regard Gaṇeśa as a god who helps petitioners overcome various kinds of obstacles. Reflecting this belief, he is usually invoked at the beginning of most formal pujas as a precautionary measure to ward off anticipated hindrances, hypothetical or otherwise. Gāṇapatyas expand this common Hindu position to interpret Gaṇeśa as the supreme manifestation of the supreme reality (brahman). 

Although archaeological and scriptural evidence point to Ganesha's emergence as a recognizable deity in the first years of the common era, it is currently impossible to indicate a precise founding date for the Gāṇapatyas. Paul Courtright, the renowned American scholar of Ganesha, identifies the duration from the 6th to the 10th centuries CE as the likely time span of their early development. Some texts report that at least 6 different Gāṇapatya maṭhas (institutions) existed contemporaneously with those established by the theologian Śankara in the 9th century CE. Between the 6th to the 16th centuries CE, historians have noted the construction of dozens of temples across North, West and Southern India with Ganesha enshrined as the principal deity. Additionally, scholars of Hinduism have called attention to the composition of different Puranas and Tantras during the same period that describe the elaborate rituals and mythologies of textually-grounded communities that self-identify with the Gāṇapatya label. 

While they appear to have died out as an independent sampradāya by the 17th century CE for reasons that will be illuminated in other sections of this entry, vestigial traces of Gāṇapatya-like practices continue to be observed in most forms of Indian religion. These practices are especially pronounced in Marathi-speaking areas. Courtright correlates the emergence of neo-Gāṇapatya movements in Maharashtra to political ascent of the Peshwas in the late 17th century. Appointed to serve as Prime Ministers at the court of the region's Maratha ruler, the Peshwas were largely derived from Chitpāvan Brahmin caste and worshipped   Ganesha as their clan deity (kuladevatā). They pioneered an elaborate display of the scripturally-prescribed, autumn Ganesh Chaturthi at their palace in Pune's Old City; these embellishments added amplified levels of grandeur to a festival that was hitherto observed as a domestic ritual at a simpler scale, subject to the discretion of individual families. These celebrations served to rekindle popular interest in temporarily-forgotten Gāṇapatya temples and the latter have since enjoyed a dramatic rise in patronage from Hindus of all sampradāyas. 

In the 1890s, the Pune palace's Ganesh Chaturthi ceremony was re-engineered by freedom fighter and religious reformer Bal Gangadhar Tilak into a festival celebrated almost entirely in the public domain. In the ensuing decade, the popularity of Tilak's remodeled ritual inspired the creation of countless ""Ganpati mandals"" (Ganesha committees) across Maharashtra, all dedicated to the organization of a 10-day long puja in honor of Ganesha that attracted participants from across the spectrum of Maharastrian castes. Scholars of Marathi religion like GS Ghurye and Anne Feldhaus have remarked that the universalization of Ganesh Chaturthi has enabled nationalists to itemize neo-Ganapatya beliefs as a distinctive marker of a Hindu-Marathi identity that continues to be mobilized in opposition to region's other religious influences. 

In more recent years, the Mumbai-based Bollywood film industry has frequently highlighted the worship of Ganesha, thereby motivating the reproduction of Ganesh Chaturthi festivals in other Indian states and in international cities that have large populations of Indian immigrants. All of these details notwithstanding, the residue of Ganapatya worship constitutes an essential aspect of modern Hinduism. A deeper investigation of this sampradaya reveals significant insights qua the nature of Indian religion at disparate historical moments.",500,2020,1135,795,Aditya Bhattacharjee,2020-08-12 06:05:18.365 +0200,2020-08-21 08:43:10.091 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
972,Nestorian Christianity,43,Religious Group (v6),"Nestorian Christianity as a distinguished Christian group came into existence after the Christological movement that held the theological position initially developed by Nestorius (4/5 CE). Nestorius considered Christ the Son of God and Christ the son of Mary as two separate persons with two natures rather than one person having human and divine nature. That Christological teaching was officially condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 431. The Council of Ephesus anathema led to the separation of the early Church, development of the Nestorian doctrine and ultimately initiated the process of creating the so-called Church of the East. The teaching of the Church of the East as it developed throughout history should be distinguished from the initial Nestorian teaching. Theological differences quickly had political and socio-cultural implications at the global level (relationship with the Western Church as well as other Christian communities in the East).

Historically speaking, Nestorian Christians played an important role in bringing Christianity to China as well as other regions like Mongolia and India. The historical timeline of Nestorian Christianity depends on the region, socio-cultural setting and date of missionary penetration. 
The bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) Nestorian stele (8th ct) from Xian witnesses to the early 7th century presence of Christians in the area. Nestorian Christians also reached India, and interacted with many other groups as Mongols, Turks, and Uigurs.  Members of the Nestorian community played an importan role during the Islamic period when they translated many works by Aristotle into Arabic (e.g. Timothy I). Modern Assyrian Church of the East is the successor of medieval Nestorian Christians, but its doctrine today should not be identified with Nestorius. After the disintegration of the Mongolian Empire during the 14th century, the Church of the East faced rapid decline. In the aftermath of these events, the presence of Nestorian Christianity was mainly reduced to India and Mesopotamia. During the 16h century, some members of the community united with the Roman Catholic Church and were named Chaldeans, whereas those who did not united with the RCC became known as Assyrians. Nestorian Christians faced persecutions in Persia during the 6th century, but flourished in China (7-10th ct), and was also well received during the medieval Mongolian period.",431,1500,1121,770,Srecko Koralija,2020-08-12 15:59:03.660 +0200,2020-08-15 20:44:08.278 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
973,The Sarna religion of the Oraons of Jharkhand,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Indian state of Jharkhand is the homeland of 32 Scheduled Tribes (ST) and eight particularly vulnerable tribal groups.  According to the 2011 census, about four million Jharkhand residents are ST and the Oraon, who follow the Sarna religion, are about million. They are counted as ""other religions and persuasions"". The Sarna religion is based on animism and is sometimes called Addi Dharam.  They believe in a benevolent spirit and reply upon it for their overall wellbeing. The term 'Sarna' refers to a Sacred Grove or place of worship (which is usually a  Sal tree of the Shorea robusta species). The sacred grove is a small patch of forest that is protected because it is sacred and the site of deity worship. 'Spirits of the forest' are said to dwell in the roots of Sal trees, and 'spirits of the village' are said to reside in the most ancient of the Sal trees of the Sarna, or sacred grove of the village.  The tribal version of Sarna when we consider this linguistically offers a very pertinent explanation of the term Sarna. In Kurukh (Oraon language) there is a term called ''Saara Baana'' which means 'work to be accomplished'. In such a way, the place where all the wishes and works are accomplished is called Sarna. Controlling these events are different types of spirits: ancestral spirits, spirits of people who died unnaturally, or forest spirits. The sacred place is home to the deity Sarna Mai. Furthermore, people’s activities are based around propitiating, through blood sacrifice, spirits that happen to reside in nature. The Mundas and the Santals go to Sarna/Jaher for most of their religious rites, but Oraons go to Sarna only once a year. This yearly visit is for Khaddi, or the Sarhul feast, and the remaining have their own specific places of worship. The highest divinity or Supreme being, the creator of the Universe recognized by the Sarna Oraon is Dharmes. He fosters all living and non-living things. They believe that spirits control all the goods and the ills of life, like earthquakes, cyclones, and floods.  Second in the hierarchy are the spirits of naturally dead ancestors, called Pachbalar. Later sections belong to the village deities and spirits (Bansakti, Banjaribhut, Chatur-Siman-Garhadhora, Tusa-bhura). The fourth section are the spirits of hunting and war, called Chandi, worshipped by men; and spirits which protect pregnant women from the evil eye, called Joda and Achrael, worshipped only by women. The religion is organized around many tribal groups throughout Chattishgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and West Bengal.",1845,2019,1136,616,Meenakshi Munda,2020-08-12 17:16:33.308 +0200,2020-09-08 11:45:41.989 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
974,"Greek Chalcedonian Christians, Nicaea",43,Religious Group (v6),"The empire of Nicaea existed from 1204 to 1261. Following the capture of Constantinople (modern Istanbul), many elites and the patriarch of the capital city moved to nearby Nicaea (modern Iznik), and this arrangement continued until 1261 when Constantinople fell to Michael VIII. Though predominantly (even almost exclusively) a Greek speaking, Chalcedonian Christian polity, it sat at the crossroads of polities comprised largely of Slavic Chalcedonian Christians, Roman Chalcedonian Christians, and Sunni Muslims. The mass movement of ecclesiastical hierarchy ensured, on the one hand, a general continuation of religious practice as it stood prior to the move, but led, on the other, to the development of new saints’ cults and religious festivals. 
By the 1220s, the political capital had moved largely to Nymphaion, almost 400 km from Nicaea, where the patriarch and the religious authorities remained. There remained, nevertheless, close ties, even with somewhat increased independence. The Greek patriarch, in exile from the traditional see in Constantinople, found a home in various monasteries and churches in Nicaea, while still maintaining a strong claim to the Constantinopolitan throne. A kind of intellectual bifurcation arose: they were on the one hand banished from their home, while on the other, they had found a safe, and quasi-paradisiacal, refuge. 
The disruptive time from 1204 to 1261 does not seem to have produced any major discontinuities from a previous or later period, but perhaps new, and sometimes contradictory, emphases. Anti-Latin polemics, which had been present for centuries, heightened, but efforts towards union with the Roman church continued under the guidance of several emperors and patriarchs. There seemed to be a common vacillation between anti-papal and functionally pro-papal stances. The Roman state had long seen itself as a new Israel, and now the language of Israel in exile continued. Penalties against Jews, however, did not subside and indeed increased. Although occasional alliances with the Seljuks occurred and emperors sought the support of Seljuk leaders, a more favorable stance towards Islam does not seem to have arisen. 
New devotions appeared and certain old devotions increased. St Tryphon became a dynastic, and his feast became a major celebration during the time in Nicaea, which seems to cool after the return to Constantinople. Devotions to St John the Theologian and the Theotokos, long present in Roman society, increase and persist after the move from Nicaea. The devotion to the Theotokos may be seen even on seals and coins.",1204,1261,1124,817,Nikolas Churik,2020-08-12 20:37:15.382 +0200,2021-05-18 06:01:02.590 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
975,Neo-Charismatic Movement - Third Wave Charismatic Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pentecostal and Charismatic practices of speaking in tongues through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit had become accepted within many mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church by the 1960s and 1970s. However, many evangelical traditions and churches continued to resist charismatic renewal practices and theologies during the rise of the Second Wave Charismatic Renewal Movement. Charismatics were viewed with suspicion and their practices were critiqued and mocked within evangelical circles.  

Yet, evangelicalism was not immune to change during the 1960s and 1970s. The hippie-led Jesus People Movement took hold in the United States during this time. Young barefoot preachers would encourage their peers to turn away from drugs, accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and join a new type of church that emphasized a come-as-you-are vibe with casual dress and provided rock and roll as part of their worship liturgy. In addition, many of the new hippie converts were interested in Charismatic practices of healing and witnessing through signs and wonders. The Jesus People Movement led to the formation of new independent evangelical churches that identified as non-denominational and some of these churches embraced Charismatic theology and practices.

One of the church movements that emerged in the late 1970s was the Vineyard Church in Southern California. The Vineyard was a collection of churches that broke away from Calvary Chapel due to the Vineyard’s desire to emphasize Charismatic practices and theology. On Mother’s Day in 1980, Pastor John Wimber of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Orange County, CA and invited a former Calvary Chapel pastor and the face of the Jesus People Movement, Lonnie Frisbee, to preach. Frisbee’s message on healing and the subsequent ministry of healing that took place that morning launched the start of the Vineyard Movement and subsequent Neo-Charismatic movement. This new Neo-Charismatic movement blended evangelical theology with charismatic practices of healing, supernatural prayer languages, and an emphasis on miraculous signs and wonders as a component of evangelism. 

John Wimber began to teach at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA and was influenced by C. Peter Wagner’s research on church growth as well as George Ladd’s Kingdom of God theology. Wimber was able to influence numerous people to start their own independent charismatic churches and ministries as a faculty member and through his conferences that he hosted where he taught on how to minister using supernatural signs and wonder. Wimber developed the concept of “power evangelism” where adherents evangelized using signs and wonders rather than Bible tracts that were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  

By the 1990s, new independent churches and movements that were evangelical and charismatic were rapidly emerging throughout North America. These included the Toronto Blessing Movement began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church. Bethel Church in Redding, CA installed Pastor Bill Johnson as their senior pastor in 1996. The International House of Prayer Kansas City was founded in 1999. These Neo-Charismatic churches and others have become popular and controversial for their encouragement of the miraculous, their non-formal style of liturgy, and theological stances on healing, anointing, and supernatural power.

C. Peter Wagner coined the term “Third Wave” charismatic movement to describe these new churches and ministries. Their emphasis on power evangelism, charismatic forms of worship, healing, prayer languages, operating in signs and wonders, and their emphasis on anointing leaders as apostles and prophets made them distinct from traditional Pentecostal churches and Charismatic Renewalists within mainline traditions.",1980,2020,1018,762,Nathan Womack,2020-08-12 23:23:50.552 +0200,2020-08-20 07:03:33.628 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
976,Mising Community,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mising community identifies as tribal and indigenous to Assam with migratory connections to the adjacent state of Arunachal Pradesh, in the northeastern region of India. They find definitive mentions in written sources, such as the Ahom Buranjis of the Ahom kingdom in Assam, from approximately 12th-15th centuries AD. They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe but are attempting to get 6th Schedule status. The 6th Schedule is a Government of India legislation that provides tribal autonomy in judicio-administrative proceedings of areas designated as Scheduled Areas. 

The community speaks Mising, a Tibeto-Burman language which is seen by several scholars to mark its migratory connection with the Sino-Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman region. They also speak Assamese. 

The Mising inhabit the Brahmaputra river valley along its northern bank covering several districts. This particular entry covers the Mising community living in small river islands known as the char region in Lakhimpur District, Assam. Surrounded by the Subansiri tributary of the River Brahmaputra, the chars are erosional spaces, some of which are submerged with the lashing of the floods each monsoon in the months of June and July. This char region is physically removed from areas across the river and require travel by ferries. 

The religion ascribed to by respondents from the river island area is understood as a mixture of Mising religious practices that focus on nature worship and Hinduism, specifically Vaishnavite Hindu practices. There is mention of the Vaishnava tradition being the first indicator of a conversion to Hinduism due to the popularity of the same in the region.  The Neo-Vaishnavite movement in Assam which is linked to spiritual leader Srimanta Sankardeva around15th century CE is often proclaimed as a socially 'integrative' and 'assimilative' force which saw tribal communities such as the Mising converting to Vaishnavism. 

The community continues to practice nature worship through several rituals honoring Donyi and Polo, referring to the sun and moon respectively.  Among other forces worshipped are asu(water), among(earth), asar(wind).
 
In 2019, there was seen to be a push amongst certain river island communities towards an increased emphasis on Donyi-Polo worship. That year, the BJP government won several tribal council elections and built alliances with Mising political parties.",1187,2019,1133,823,Nimisha Thakur,2020-08-13 13:18:23.560 +0200,2020-08-20 10:27:15.312 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
977,Chishti Sufis,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Chishtis are a Sufi order of immense influence in South Asia, founded in Chisht, Afghanistan, in the tenth century and brought to South Asia in the late twelfth century AD. It is considered the oldest of the Sufi orders operating in the region, and has enjoyed patronage from rulers and politicians throughout its history. Divided into sub-branches, the Chishti order is still influential today. 

The order quickly spread across South Asia even before Delhi’s political ascendancy, with early lodges (khanqahs) acting as sites of influence in Bengal, Gujarat, Malwa and the Deccan. Scholars have noted that such expansion indicates how the order was able to assimilate to social life in these areas; it is likely that for early adherents, Islam was synonymous with the teachings of the local Chishti shaykhs. This focus on adapting to local conditions has also been cited as a reason for their historically close relationship to local rulers and nobility. 

In the eighteenth century, the majority-Muslim qasbah towns of the Upper Doab emerged as sites of Chishti influence.

In Chishti sacred geography, the city of Delhi is especially significant. The shrine of Shaykh Nizamuddin Auliya (d. 1325) is an important site of pilgrimage: each year, the six-day urs ceremony held on the anniversary of Nizamuddin Auliya’s death attracts 150,000 people from across the country. Rulers based in Delhi helped to consolidate the shrine’s importance. Another important pilgrimage site is in Ajmer, Rajasthan, the burial place of Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236). Emperor Akbar relocated the Mughal capital to the village of Fatehpur Sikri to be next to the site of shaykh Salim Chishti’s (d. 1572) khanqah. 

Though the shrines were always popular, membership in the Chishti order was associated with elites in Mughal times. From the late seventeenth century on, initiation into multiple Sufi orders became more common among prominent Muslim intellectuals, and many Muslim reformers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries belonged to several orders. While pilgrimage and participation in festivals at shrines is widespread among South Asian Muslims (and some Hindus), formal membership in the order is now largely hereditary, as each Chishti shrine is maintained by a familial lineage of ‘sajjada nasheen’ or spiritual heads of the shrine, who wield power and influence as beneficiaries of donations made to the shrine and managers of its calendar of festivals.

Within the landscape of South Asian Sufi groups, the Chishtis are predominant. They are known for the importance of music in their religious gatherings: Chishtis are credited with the invention of qawwali music, a South Asian devotional genre which is sung on Thursday nights at many shrines and during the annual ‘urs’ festivals which commemorate the saint’s union with God upon their death. The Chishti order has historically been associated with what has been called a ‘syncretic’ culture in South Asia, merging elements from Hindu society in their devotional practices, for example in the rituals surrounding the tomb of the shaykh. 

The order defines itself based on a chain of authority (Silsila, meaning dynasty or literally ‘chain’) that links its spiritual leaders (shaykhs) to each other all the way back to the Prophet. Consequently, there are several sub-sects established at breaking points in this list of shaykhs, called a ‘shajra’, though these are not theologically distinct. In South Asia, the two main branches are the Chishti-Sabri (after ‘Alā-ud-dīn ‘Alī Sābir, d. c. 1291) and the Chishti-Nizami (named for Nizamuddin Auliya, d. 1325).",1200,2020,1127,815,Hallie Swanson,2020-08-13 17:11:40.867 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:33.341 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
978,Indonesian Catholicism,43,Religious Group (v6),"As a part of the universal Catholic Church, Indonesian Catholicism features all of the rites, scripture, hierarchy present in Roman Catholicism. As anywhere, however, this world religion is expressed, understood, and practiced in accordance with the unique cultural history of Indonesia. Initially arriving with Portuguese traders in the early sixteenth century, Indonesian Catholicism has grown and flourished, becoming a powerful religious and political contender in the country and beyond. Demonstrating significant diversity across the archipelago, Indonesian Catholicism often integrates itself with local traditions and accommodates itself to the needs of different peoples.

Catholics have played important roles in Indonesian history, contributing greatly to the national character and vision. In the nation’s early days, Catholic politicians and religious figures opposed the movement to require adherence to Islam, advocating instead for religious freedom. The effects of these debates can be seen in Indonesia’s current policy of monotheism that recognizes six ‘official’ religions. One of Indonesia’s principle newspapers, Kompas, was begun by Catholics in the1960s to offer an alternative to the media and perspectives of the Communist Party at the time. Today Kompas is a secular newspaper.  As in many parts of the world, Catholic schools and hospitals have often provided excellent education and healthcare, especially in remote regions that the state initially had trouble reaching, in this country of over 17,000 islands. 

Demographically, Catholics make up only a small minority of Indonesia’s population: 2.91% according to the 2010 census, or about 7 million individuals. Of the 33 provinces existing during this census (room was made for a 34th in 2012), the provinces with the greatest number of Catholics were East Nusa Tenggara (54.14%), West Kalimantan (22.94%), and Papua (17.67%). East Nusa Tenggara is the only region where Catholics comprise a greater percentage of the population than any other religious group. Across Indonesia, 65% of Catholics live in the countryside, while the remaining 35% live in cities. Papua, West Papua, and East Nusa Tenggara are the poorest provinces in Indonesia (According to 2019-2020 data). 

The demographic distribution of religion in Indonesia, together with a lively culture of internal mobility and migration, means that certain ethnic groups have become associated in-country with Catholicism. Prominent among these are the Batak of Sumatra, some Dayak groups from Kalimantan, and some Chinese-Indonesians. Perhaps most well-known for their Catholic history and culture are the Florenese, whose yearly processions draw thousands of pilgrims from around the country. While members of these groups have gained recognition as propagating Catholicism in Indonesia, Catholics can be found across the country, of many different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Throughout it’s rich history, Indonesian Catholicism has contributed important ideas, values, and expressions both to the country of Indonesia and the global Catholic Church, strengthening the diversity of each.",1500,2020,1053,825,MeghanRose Donnelly,2020-08-13 17:55:54.231 +0200,2020-08-25 23:11:57.122 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
980,Pure Land Buddhist Schools in Early Medieval Japan,43,Religious Group (v6),"The rise of the exclusive practice of the chanted nenbutsu (Jpn. senju nenbutsu) was integral to the development of Buddhism in medieval Japan. It involves exclusively practicing single-minded invocation of the Buddha Amitābha (Amida)’s name with six characters, “Na-mu A-mi-da butsu”—literally meaning “Homage to Amida Buddha”—, by which to achieve salvation, birth in his Pure Land after one’s death. The teaching of the exclusive nenbutsu represents a major intellectual trend in medieval Japanese Buddhism, where liberation from saṃsāric rebirth was often thought to depend on a single practice or condition. The doctrinal root of the teaching lies in the thought of a Japanese Buddhist thinker Hōnen-bō Genkū (1133-1212). In the late twelfth century, Hōnen developed the radical claim that in the time when the Buddhist path is leading to its extinction, the entirety of this path should be encapsulated in a single practice of the chanted nenbutsu, through which he thought all sentient being will achieve birth in Amida’s Pure Land after death. While the chanted nenbutsu had been traditionally construed as one of least essential practices suitable only to those of lesser religious capacity, Hōnen claimed its centrality in the Buddhist path, because he conceived it as a sole practice that Amida found corresponding to his original vow to save all sentient beings. According to him, Amida’s selection of the chanted nenbutsu from multiple practices rendered all sentient beings equally benighted and thus urged them to rely completely on the other power of Amida’s original vow that already guaranteed salvation. This claim led Hōnen to even insist that all other practices that require self-reliant efforts are to be totally abandoned. Hōnen’s teaching was further developed by one of his disciples Shinran (1173-1262), who gave a clearer expression to the absolute other power of Amida Buddha. These two thinkers, Hōnen and Shinran, were later regarded as the founders of two prominent Pure Land Buddhist schools, Pure Land school (Jōdo shū) and True Pure Land school (Jōdo Shinshū) respectively. They promoted the exclusive nenbutsu to address primarily the soteriological equality. However, as their followers proselytized the teaching from the late twelfth century, it did entail social implications for considering whether even those persons who violate religious and social norms could attain salvation. The teaching was thus of great appeal to those deemed as the hard-to-save in medieval society. Among them were included warriors, whose profession was taking lives, and women, who was regarded as with heavy karmic hindrances. The exclusive nenbutsu, however, also entailed an openness to the antinomian impulse, serving to legitimize zealous followers’ excessive acts, such as licensed evil and intentional violation the precepts. This invited severe criticism of Hōnen, Shinran, and their followers from the religious authority of the time and urged the authority to engage in suppressions of the followers’ groups.",1175,1333,1141,826,Kentaro Ide,2020-08-16 21:21:12.313 +0200,2020-08-25 07:47:18.463 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
981,Nation of Islam,43,Religious Group (v6),"Established in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929, the Nation of Islam is a religious movement that facilitates its predominantly African-American followers to learn how to maintain a healthy lifestyle in urban settings.  The movement evolved out of a chance encounter between Clara Evans and Fard Muhammad on Hastings Street, the famous south-north street east of Downtown Detroit where a large number of African-American migrants from the rural south lived due to limited housing opportunities elsewhere in the city. Fard introduced Clara to a set of ritual practices related to hygiene, clothing, and diet rooted in the teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a prophetic figure from Qadian, Punjab. Clara drew upon his teachings to overcome dependency on public assistance amidst working as a domestic servant with an unemployed husband and a growing family. Faced by a declining Detroit Public School System, Clara established a homeschool for the neighborhood's children as well as adults, offering an Islamic education geared at overcoming periodic unemployment and the accompanying shame of failing to look after one's family. Over the next two decades, Clara and her fellow sisters helped expand the homeschool on a national scale, with similar schools appearing in other cities in the midwest with a large African-American population such as Chicago, Milwaukee, and Indianapolis as well as on the eastern seaboard such as Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Harlem (New York) and Boston. Since the passing of Clara's husband Elijah Muhammad in 1975, the Nation of Islam has split into two factions: one that abides by the doctrinal innovations introduced by Elijah such as his status as a Prophet and Fard as God incarnate and another that follows Elijah's son Warith (Wallace) Deen Muhammad exhortation to embrace Sunni Islam and its understanding of prophecy and divinity rooted in the Quran and the hadith. These doctrinal contestations however are overshadowed by a consensus among members of both factions that black motherhood is both scientifically advanced and morally upright.",1930,2020,1153,748,SherAfgan Tareen,2020-08-17 16:37:11.736 +0200,2021-11-30 18:19:31.489 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
982,The Samaritans (Persian to early Roman periods),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Samaritans are a religious group in the Abrahamic Tradition that originated in northern Israel. The group, which exists to the present day, traces its origins to ancient Israel and holds that their southern neighbors split off from them during the time of Eli. Ancient Samaritans worshiped the God of Israel and claimed that they, not the Jews, preserved the correct practices for worship. The separation between the two groups was gradual but would likely have been established by the time of (or as a result of) Hyrcanus’ destruction of the temple at Mt. Gerizim in the 2nd century BCE. 
The primary religious text of the Samaritans is called the Samaritan Pentateuch, or the Samaritan Torah, which contains the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Traditionally, Samaritans regard the Pentateuch as the only authoritative biblical books. Although most of the differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Jewish Torah are largely technical, the Samaritan Pentateuch includes several substantive differences, most of which are related to their claim that Mt. Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the appropriate place for worshiping the God of Israel. 
The major sources on early Samaritans include Josephus, the New Testament, and Rabbinic Literature, although references to the Samaritans have also been suggested in works such as Ezra, Nehemiah, and Ben Sira. In addition to literary sources, much recent work in archaeology has provided further information about the ancient Samaritans.",-499,100,1138,824,Sara Boston,2020-08-17 17:22:17.818 +0200,2020-08-28 12:52:45.250 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
983,Tibetan and Himalayan Mundane and Landscape Cults,43,Religious Group (v6),"Across the large geographical space of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas, cultures and societies of speakers of Tibetic languages share certain religious notions and similar ritual practices which do not derive from Buddhism or Yungdrung Bön (g.Yung drung Bon) but rather relate to local natural environments and social structures. Being very variable and difficult to subsume under one term, these localised religious cults have been called ‘popular’ (Bell 1931), ‘nameless’ (Stein 1972), ‘folk’ (Tucci 1980), often also ‘shamanism’ or ‘bön’ (bon), and in specific cases ‘pagan’ (Ramble 2008) and ‘mundane’. They are concerned with mundane aims of well-being and prosperity, fecundity and progeniture, health, protection and warfare, and general worldly success; not with soteriology. They most likely represent indigenous, pre-Buddhist cults of Tibet and the Himalayas.

Cosmologically, the world is threefold, composed from (1.) the upper heavenly sphere of deities (lha / lha); (2.) the middle earthly level inhabited by humans and other, including supernatural, beings (for ex. nyen / gnyan, tsen / btsan, dü / bdud, etc.), usually rendered into English as gods, deities, spirits, demons, etc.; and (3.) the lower chthonic realm of various other beings (widely called lu / klu). Humans in the intermediate level come into contact with beings, more or less powerful, benevolent or malicious, from all the three permeable spheres, and must develop methods of communication and coexistence with them in order to live and prosper. These typically consist of prescribed behavior and taboos, invocations, offerings and other ritual means, by which people acquire forces of good fortune, prosperity and fertility, and avoid possible punishments. These beings are often anthropomorphic and perceived to dwell in the sky (or elaborated atmospheric levels) or in physical structures, both natural and man-made: mountains, hills, rocks, boulders, water sources, plants; hearth, the main house pillar; and also in the human body. As they can be in fact omni-present, they often influence people’s lived daily realities and practices. Probably thousands of such deities exist, at times organised into hierarchised groups. 

Territorial deities, commonly called yüllha (yul lha, ‘god of a valley/region’), zhidak (gzhi bdag, ‘lord of a base/place/soil’), yüllha zhidak (yul lha gzhi bdag), or yülsa (yul sa, ‘lord of earth/place’), tend to be the most prominent, and among them mountain deities believed to inhabit mountain glaciers and peaks and govern their surroundings. Mountain deities, and certain deities of the celestial realm, are sometimes perceived as ancestors of descent lines and whole communities, usually tied to patrilines and one’s birth place. Mountains and their deities have become important symbols of regional and, especially since the mid-20th century, also Tibetan national identity, such as Mt Kailash, Gang Tisé (Gangs ti se) or Gang Rinpoche (Gangs rin po che) in Tibetan, in West Tibet, and Anyé Machen (A myes rma chen) in East Tibet. The paramount Mt Everest is also sacred and hosts goddess Jomo Langma (Jo mo glang ma). Almost all local cults have been historically exposed to Buddhist and Yungdrung Bön domination, and in most cases were to varying degrees incorporated into the two Doctrines. Vice versa, they have influenced all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including Yungdrung Bön, by bringing strong local elements into even common monastic practice. Many local cults are very vulnerable also to current globalising and modernisation pressures.",600,2020,1107,736,Anna Sehnalova,2020-08-21 16:23:57.765 +0200,2021-04-10 21:58:56.454 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
984,Calvinism (Early/Reformation),43,Religious Group (v6),"Calvinism, in its early stages, drew its character and theological emphases from the ministry and teaching of John Calvin. Born in France, Calvin moved to Geneva in 1534 and, after a brief exile (1538-41), he returned and was installed as the religious leader of the new republic. Calvin was influenced by other early Reformers—Martin Luther, Huylrich Zwingli, Philip Melancthon, and Heinrich Bullinger—and adopted the theological touchstones of the movement: scripture alone, faith alone, grace alone, Christ alone, and glory to God alone. While early Calvinism continued to affirm much of the Christian tradition, Calvin was instrumental in forming his own distinct form of Protestantism. Theologically, early Calvinism distinguished itself from Roman Catholicism in its understanding of the authority of scripture, the person and work of Jesus Christ (Christology), the emphasis on God’s election (predestination), the sacraments, and on the purpose and shape of the Christian life. In terms of the latter, Calvin uniquely combined the ecclesiastical structures of the church in Geneva with the local governing structures, effectively combining his theological commitments about the transformation of the human being by the grace of God in faith with their social and ethical expressions. His understanding of the way the Church could and should regulate the moral lives of citizens, as well as church members, was rooted in an expectation that this was how societies, nations, and eventually the world, would be transformed. While later Calvinism is associated with a number of different ecclesiastical forms and cannot be said to agree on any one set of theological doctrines, early Calvinism was very much tied to the person of John Calvin and the local way he applied his theology, ecclesiastically and politically, in Geneva. Where applicable, it will include the work of his contemporaries in the Reformation moments (i.e., Zwingli in Switzerland, Luther in Germany)",1520,1565,1139,828,Chelsea Williams,2020-08-21 19:38:04.041 +0200,2020-09-08 17:28:45.287 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
985,The Victorines,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Victorines refer to the individuals, thought and practices associated with the Catholic abbey of St Victor. Established by William of Champeaux (1070 – 1121) in 1108, just outside Paris on the left bank of the Seine, the abbey of St. Victor was founded as a refuge for contemplation and teaching, surviving until its dissolution during the French Revolution. This focus on teaching made St Victor part-abbey, part-school, accepting adult male novices aged 15 or over. St Victor rose to prominence in the first and second quarters of the twelfth century under a series of talented abbots and teachers, becoming a renowned centre for theological and philosophical innovation. The exhortation to ‘learn everything’ (omnia disce) issued by the order’s most famous master, Hugh of St Victor (c. 1096 – 1141), served aptly as the statement of the institution’s methodology and purpose. Poetry, metaphysics, history, biblical exegesis, humanism, trinitarian theology, contemplation and mysticism were all practiced within the abbey’s walls. What united members of the school of St Victor was the belief that the categorisation, systematisation and harmonisation of theology and philosophy possessed the salvific purpose of restoring man to the ‘image and likeness’ of God. 

Denominationally, the abbey of St Victor belonged to the religious – as opposed to secular – branch of canons (regular canons) who lived communally, were attached to a church, and followed a particularly strict interpretation of the Rule of St Augustine for instruction. Like other twelfth-century Augustinian groups of regular canons, for example, the Premonstratensians, the identity of the Victorines and their ethos of reform was shaped by the Gregorian Reform movement from the mid-eleventh century that had reorganised the clergy and re-emphasised their commitment to poverty and teaching. What differentiated the Victorines from other groups of canons regular were its royal connections, the stress of a life of philosophical virtue and its specific blend of love and friendship – a trait shared with monastic orders of the day. However, in contrast to Benedictine, Cistercian and Augustinian monks, the Victorines occupied a liminal position as a ‘quasi monastic’ organisation. While monastic traits such as hierarchical system of titles, a central legislative body and a rule of silence were observed, the Victorines avoided a system of unequal mother-daughter house filiations like the Cistercians, equally emphasised theological and philosophical knowledge, and their geographical position close to the city ensured that they retained a distinctive balance between the active and contemplative modes of life.",1108,1299,1143,830,Jack Ford,2020-08-24 22:51:30.721 +0200,2020-09-25 10:12:40.802 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
986,Theurgy,43,Religious Group (v6),"Theurgy in late antiquity combined Platonic philosophy with the indigenous ritual practices of the Roman Empire (sacrifice, divination, etc.). Although theurgy first appeared in the so-called Chaldean Oracles of the second century CE, the most important surviving statement of theurgic theory and practice is the treatise ""On the Mysteries"" (De mysteriis) of the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus (c. 240 – c. 325 CE). Scholars generally understand Neoplatonism beginning with Iamblichus to represent a break with the earlier thought of Plotinus (205 – 270 CE) due to its reliance on ritual as a means of salvation for the soul. After Iamblichus, the most important expositor of theurgic Neoplatonism was Proclus (412 – 485 CE), whose ideas directly influenced the Christian liturgy of pseudo-Dionysius. The word theurgy combines two Greek roots, theos (god) and ourgos (work). As ""divine work,"" theurgy is understood to be a cooperative endeavor between the gods and human beings, in which the latter use divinely inspired ritual to increase their fitness for divine influence. Informed by centuries of Platonic thinking about individual and cosmic bodies, theurgy maps the parts of the self (microcosm) onto the parts of the universe (macrocosm), allowing one to enact rituals in order to purify or empower the parts of the self through an understanding of cosmic sympathy. Theurgic ritual, according to Iamblichus and Proclus, interacts with the various parts of the highly stratified divine cosmos, which is itself envisioned (following Plato’s Timaeus 30d-31a) as a single living being encompassing all other beings. The metaphor of a living cosmos provides the basis for the doctrine of cosmic sympathy (sumpatheia) and its transcendent cause, divine love (theia philia), which provides cohesion for the universe (macrocosm) as well as for the individual soul (microcosm). The sympathy between the soul, the universe, and the gods allows the theurgist to employ ""signatures"" (sumbola, sunthēmata) consisting of natural materials (e.g. stones, plants, incense), divine names, and mental constructs in order to achieve his or her goals. The goals of theurgy are consistent with those of Platonic philosophy – becoming like god (ὁμοίωσις θεῷ: Plato’s Theaetetus 176b) – as a lifelong practice producing a ""cumulative contact, assimilation, and, ultimately, union with the divine and thereby the divinization of the theurgist"" (Addey 2014: 25). A cosmic hierarchy of beings, thought forms, and ritual objects informed this lifelong practice and may have made theurgy difficult to distinguish from magic for the casual observer. In fact, the principles of theurgic ritual were very close to Plotinus’s account of how magic (mageia, goēteia) functioned through cosmic sympathy (Ennead 4.4.40). However, theurgy was distinct from ancient magic in at least two ways: (1) The aims of theurgy were different. Whereas magicians might think to coerce the gods for their own worldly ends, theurgists (and all Platonists) understood the gods to be immutable, so they instead focused on enhancing their own fitness for assimilating divine power, which was a gift from the gods. (2) Although cosmic sympathy in its popular form may have functioned ""horizontally"" in the material world only, for theurgists sympathy as an expression of divine love (theia philia) always had a vertical component: objects in the material world derived their potency from divine powers by corresponding to a certain ""chain"" (seira) of influence, such as a planet or another astrological category.",150,529,1144,778,Brian Alt,2020-08-24 23:09:19.924 +0200,2020-09-11 05:00:17.397 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
987,"Parsis, Zoroastrians of India",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Parsis (or Parsees) are an ethno-religious community traditionally based in western India, and professing the Zoroastrian religion. They are the descendants of the group of Zoroastrians who migrated to India after the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century CE. The Parsis of India constitute the largest community of followers of Zoroastrianism in the world. Over the centuries, the Parsis have integrated into Indian society, while simultaneously maintaining their distinct religious customs and ethnic identity. The term Pārsi (meaning ‘Persian’ in the Persian language) is used as a descriptor of the community signifying their Iranian origin.
The early history of the Parsis in India is not known well, and mainly traced to a single source, the Qisse-ye Sanjān ‘The Story of Sanjān’ dated to 1600 CE. After initially settling in and around the town of Sanjān in South Gujarat on the west coast of India, they are supposed to have dispersed northwards to other towns in Gujarat, mainly Navsari, Ankleshwar, Bharuch and Khambat (Cambay).
However the period from the 17th century onward is relatively well recorded, and after the arrival of the British in India, the Parsis transformed from a predominantly rural agricultural community to one engaged in many services and industrial pursuits, especially in the cities of Surat and Bombay. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the community rapidly rising to prominence, and under British patronage, were pioneers in many fields including education and the arts. Many prominent families amassed large fortunes and the community became well-known for its munificent charities. In the 20th century, the Parsis dispersed across the Indian sub-continent as well as to other British colonies such as Aden and East African countries.
The Parsis today are a highly urbanised community with more than 95% of its members living in cities, chiefly Mumbai (formerly Bombay) which has been home to 70% of the Indian Parsis since the 1950s. The last fifty years have seen many Parsis, especially the youth, emigrating to other countries, mainly UK, USA and Canada, the Middle-east and more recently to Australia and New Zealand.  

Class: Among the Parsis, the priestly class (Athornans) is differentiated from the laity (Behdins), and the priesthood is hereditary. Only boys belonging to the priestly class are eligible to undergo the initiation ceremonies of priesthood. 
Language: Since the Parsis were based in the Indian state of Gujarat for much of their long history, their native language is Gujarati; however their dialect, Parsi Gujarati, is distinct from the standard Gujarati of the state. While almost all Parsis can converse in Gujarati, the youth especially in urban areas increasingly use English as their primary language for communication. The religious texts of the Parsis are mainly in Avestan, an Old Iranian language, and also in Pahlavi (Middle Persian). Though both these languages are not comprehended by a majority of the Parsis, all prayers are still recited in these languages as per tradition by both the priesthood and the laity.
Sects: The Parsis are differentiated from their fellow Zoroastrians who arrived from Iran to India in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are known as the Iranis. The term Parsi-Irani is used as a designator for the entire Zoroastrian community of India, however the standalone term Parsis is also used interchangeably as an all-encompassing term. 
The community is also divided on the basis of a calendrical difference into two factions, the majority Shahenshahis (‘Royalists’) who continued to follow the existing calendar of the Indian Zoroastrians, and the minority Kadimis (‘Ancients’) who adopted the old calendar of the Iranian Zoroastrians, which runs one month ahead of the Shahenshahi calendar.",1600,2020,1145,831,Kerman Daruwalla,2020-08-25 21:19:36.333 +0200,2020-09-13 00:58:20.758 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
988,Churches of Christ- United States,43,Religious Group (v6),"Churches of Christ in North America are a collection of autonomous Christian congregations that have their origins in the ""Restoration Movement"" within American Christianity that occurred in the 1800's. Located primarily in the American south, Churches of Christ emerged in the first major division of the Stone-Campbell Movement at the end of the nineteenth century. This separation was made complete in 1906, when the United States Bureau of the Census distinguished Churches of Christ as a separate and distinct religious group. There are currently more than 13,000 individual congregations within the United States with an average membership of 100 people. Of those 13,000 congregations, 1,240 of them have a predominately African American membership (approximately 172,000 members). Churches of Christ also has an additional 240 congregations that are independent Spanish-speaking churches, most of which are located in Texas, California, and Puerto Rico.

The majority of members of Churches of Christ in the United States live in the central and southern regions of the country. While there are Church of Christ congregations in every state, they are most heavily concentrated in the American south, from Texas to North Carolina. More than 28 percent of members of Churches of Christ live in either Texas or Tennessee. Churches of Christ began from a motivation not to start a new form of Christianity, but to serve as a unifying movement that sought to bring together previously divided Christians through an appeal to the pattern of Christianity as interpreted in the New Testament. 

Following from this appeal to a return to the form of Christianity present within the New Testament, Churches of Christ have rejected any formal organizational structures, choosing instead to have the local congregation serve as its own governing authority. This has also meant that Churches of Christ have no official journals or other processes by which to declare sanctioned positions. Because of the independent nature of Churches of Christ, commonalities across the tradition depend more on a specific set of practices and interpretive strategies than declared theological convictions or beliefs.

While changing within some parts of the tradition, Churches of Christ is most well-known for its practice of acapella singing. Yet there are other distinctive features that have marked this denomination as a distinctive group among other Christian traditions. First among these distinctive features is the hermeneutical approach that has been at the core of Church of Christ identity and practice since its inception. This interpretive approach rests on a three-fold pattern that reads Scripture and shapes its communal and individual practice by finding in Scripture a direct command, an example to imitate, or by making a necessary inference when commands or examples are not present. This interpretive approach has been highly influential within Churches of Christ, and is the source of many contemporary debates and the appropriate response. Second, Churches of Christ are defined by a strong commitment to notions of the priesthood of all believers, and therefore eschew any distinction between a “religious” and “non-religious” class. There is no ordination process within Churches of Christ. And while religious training (either through a theological school or some other form) is viewed as a positive thing, none is required to serve in a ministerial role within the tradition. Rather, worship and communal life within Churches of Christ is dependent upon a high level of involvement by the members of each congregation. Finally, Churches of Christ have, historically, possessed a high level of exclusivism in its understanding of its religious identity. While this characteristic has come under fire and is changing within many parts of the tradition, it has been a defining feature for much of the tradition’s history.

As it moves into the 21st century, Churches of Christ are currently facing a number of questions and challenges, ranging from questions of gender and sexuality inclusion, to the trends of religious decline that are effecting all religious traditions within the United States.",1832,2020,1146,821,Mason Lee,2020-08-28 16:18:01.121 +0200,2020-09-21 13:44:34.410 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
989,Opus Dei,43,Religious Group (v6),"Opus Dei (“Work of God” in Latin), also known as the Prelature of the Holy Cross, is a modern international institution within the Roman Catholic Church. Opus Dei was founded by Josemaria Escriva (1902-1975), a Spanish priest who was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 2002.  According to Escriva, after years of waiting to learn how God wanted Escriva to uniquely serve him, Escriva received a divine inspiration on October 2, 1928 to found a new path within the Catholic Church by which all men and women could hear and follow the universal call to holiness. The universal call to holiness refers to the belief that God desires all human beings to be saints. Escriva founded Opus Dei specifically to help Catholic lay people (i.e. non priests, monks, and nuns) become saints through their professional work. He writes that “the sole objective of Opus Dei has always been to see to it that there be men and women of all races and social conditions who endeavor to love and to serve God and the rest of mankind in and through their ordinary work, in the midst of the realities and interests of the world” (Josemaria Escriva, Conversations, no. 10).  There are currently about 90,000 members of Opus Dei of every racial, social, and secular condition in more than 90 countries. Opus Dei is not a religious order of the Catholic church. Members of Opus Dei do not take religious vows or distinguish themselves from their fellow citizens, and they live and work in the world just as they did before they joined Opus Dei.  Members are united by the ideal of following Christ and totally giving themselves to God as ordinary citizens and family members, and thus being Christian contemplatives in the middle of the world. Escriva chose St. Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary, as the patron or special protector of Opus Dei, since St. Joseph lived an integrated life of prayer, ordinary work, and familial and social relationships. According to Escriva, the foundation of Opus Dei’s spirituality is an awareness of every human being’s divine filiation, or status as a child of God.  Members of Opus Dei are supposed to practice and share confidence in divine providence, simplicity in dialogue with God, fraternity among all people, respect for human dignity, a love for the world and all realities created by God, and a spirit of peace and cheerful hope. Other key features of Opus Dei’s spirituality are the importance of prayer and sacrifice, the value of personal freedom, charity towards others, and unity of life (i.e. the integration of one’s interior and religious life with one’s professional, social, and family life). Opus Dei has existed as an institution since 1928, but it was erected as a personal prelature of the Church in 1982 by a pontifical act. According to the formal document composed by the Sacred Congregation for Bishops and approved by Pope John Paul II, the Prelature of the Holy Cross “is directly aimed at promoting the apostolic activity of the Church, inasmuch as it puts into operation a new pastoral instrument, which up to now was only foreseen and desired in the law of the Church, and it does so through an institution which offers proven guarantees of apostolic vigor, discipline and faithfulness to the teaching of the Church” (“Vatican Declaration concerning Opus Dei,” 1982). Opus Dei is governed by the prelate of Opus Dei and his councils, who reside in Rome. The clergy of Opus Dei are drawn from the lay members of Opus Dei. The lay members of Opus Dei have the same freedom to make decisions in personal, professional, social, economic and political matters as other Catholics. They are under the jurisdiction of the prelate only “in regard to what has to do with the fulfillment of the specific ascetic formative and apostolic commitments which they have freely undertaken by means of the contractual bond dedicating them to the service of the aims of the Prelature” (“Vatican Declaration Concerning Opus Dei,” IIId).  The lay members of Opus Dei are under the jurisdiction of their diocesan bishop in all that the law lays down for the ordinary faithful.",1928,2020,1147,765,Margaret Freddoso,2020-08-29 20:29:46.165 +0200,2023-04-25 16:33:24.908 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
991,Beat Buddhism,43,Religious Group (v6),"‘Beat Buddhism’ refers to the intermediary period of experimentation with Buddhism by members of the Beat Generation (1944-1960s), most notably Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder, that preceded the emergence of popular institutional forms of convert communities in the United States which maintained religious and secular spaces for practice, like temples or meditation centers. Rather, the location of a uniquely Beat praxis of Buddhism originates from a literary tradition of exploration into ‘Oriental’ religions and mysticism first made possible by the American Romantic lineages of Transcendentalism and Theosophy in the 19th century. Although wrought with colonial assumptions about Asia; Transcendentalist writers, like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, heavily influenced the Beats’ idealistic reinterpretation and socially-informed deployment of Buddhism, which attracted the attention of mainstream American readers for the first time in the Fifties. 
The Beat Generation from which the distinctly Romantic, Protestant, and subterranean nature of Beat Buddhism arises, represents a subcultural movement that marks a watershed moment in the advancement of postmodernism in post-World War II America. The central elements of the Beat’s countercultural movement included the rejection of a status-quo maintained by traditional Christian values, a rejection of economic materialism, and a rejection of the stratification of classes based on socio-economic conformity. Instead, they sought out alternative American and Asian spiritual traditions on a quest for sexual liberation and human transcendence. In their radical pursuit of ‘satori’ (sudden enlightenment), a sudden experience of reality unfettered by the illusory restraints of dualism that appeared on the American landscape in the form of inequitable social norms, Beat Buddhism extends the discourse of D.T. Suzuki and Alan Watt’s, who repackaged Japanese Zen for American audiences by emphasizing the pure experience of the emptiness, or nondualism, of reality through the practice of living spontaneously. 
Despite the non-institutional (or even anti-institutional) and transient foundation of Beat Buddhism as a religious interlocutor between the Orientalist exploration of Buddhism through the early-20th century, and the birth of convert communities in the United States; it contains several elements that can be identified as core beliefs and practices. First, Beat Buddhism is primarily concerned with the Four Noble Truths and how to overcome individual suffering within one’s current life. For Beats like Kerouac, Buddhism provided an ontology that explained suffering as the result of social ignorance and unrest. Second, drawing from Suzuki and Watts, Beat Buddhism is emphatically centered on experiencing what Kerouac coined “the golden eternity” or emptiness as a means of escape. Beat Buddhists believed that by training oneself to perform spontaneous acts of artistic expression, especially through “stream of consciousness” prose and poetry, one could experience their true (non) selves, unadulterated by the social baggage of 1950’s America. 
Third, in a shortlist of main elements that characterize the Beats’ mobilization of Buddhism, is their romanticism of the mendicant or ascetic lifestyle. Phrases like “Zen-lunatics” and “rucksack revolution;” and hermit-like livelihoods requiring immersion with nature, like train-hopping, logging, sailing, and serving posts on fire lookouts, are idolized in the pages of Beat literature. Thus, Beat Buddhism, the quintessential form of American Buddhism from the Fifties and Sixties, maintains its lineage of textuality in which American Transcendentalism and Buddhism modernism intersect in a mutual clarion-call to rebel against the suffering caused by social conformism.",1944,1969,1149,786,STEVEN QUACH,2020-09-01 23:31:49.399 +0200,2020-09-12 22:22:52.472 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
993,Pontifex Maximus and Pontifices (Pontifical College),43,Religious Group (v6),"Perhaps, no other religious title and college has as long a tenure as the Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College, whose origins lay in the mythical foundations of Rome and continue today, albeit organizationally, religiously, and semantically different, in the Vatican within the Roman Catholic Church. The Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College has a debated origin. On the one hand, some scholars such Denova continue the traditional line that “Pontifex” means “the bridge builder” between man and the gods, and that the Pontifices were associated with the early river worship of the Tiberinus, and later Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Others such as Ribezzo and Kavanagh have argued that Pontifex comes from Sabine (Italic Oscan) and the word means “college of five” (ponti < puntes “five” and fex < trefex “college”). 
Nevertheless, what is generally agreed upon is that the Pontifices served as advisors to the king of monarchical Rome. In Roman legends and ancient Roman historiography, King Numa (according to Livy) was one of the first Pontifex Maximus who established the organizational bureaucracy of the Roman state religion, the Vestal Virgins, and the appointment of other Pontifices. Whatever the reality of the situation was during the regal period of Rome, by the Middle of the Roman Republic, the Pontifices and their college began to have power over other priesthoods of Rome: the rex sacrorum, Vestal Virgins, the other flamines of other gods, the augurs, and, finally, the haruspices. Furthermore, the Pontifical College was in charge of the following activities: record keeping (annals, commentaries, etc.), the correct form of ritual and prayers, the Roman Calendar (“fasti”), family law – patrician marriage, adoption, and the transference of dead bodies to other burial sites. Because the Pontifices were at the top of the Roman civic cult, additionally, they approved whether or not a new god could enter the Roman Pantheon (cases abound, such as Magna Mater and Quintus Metellus building a shrine to Isis -see the entry on Cult of Isis). 
To highlight their importance, the offices of the Pontifical College were located in Regia and the living quarters of the Pontifex Maximus was in the domus publica, both of which are situated in the Roman forum – the civic center of Rome. Additionally, the Pontifical College was originally only reserved to the patrician class during the Early and Middle Republic, but by 300 BC, under the lex Ogulnia, the Pontifical College was open to the plebeians and the number of pontiffs increased to nine (Rüpke). Furthermore, the Pontifex Maximus was subject to direct election of a selected number of Roman tribes (seventeen out of the thirty-five selected by lot - Rüpke), and remained an appointment for life. The first plebeian Pontifex Maximus was, perhaps, Tiberius Coruncanius elected in 254 BC by the comitia and first published public consultations (Cornu-Thénard).
One last bureaucratic feature of the Pontifical Colleges was that Pontiffs could also become secular, legal magistrates and hold political office. Cases abound, and famous examples are the jurist Scaevola and Julius Caesar. Nevertheless, the Pontiffs were prohibited from holding other priesthoods, except for rare occasions (see Szelmer). Because a person could be both a pontiff and magistrate, it is quite clear that under the Roman Republic that the Pontifical College and the Senate worked closely in tandem. The Senate consulted the Pontifical College on omens, prodigies, and on what days could public and state business be held. At times, the position of pontiff could be used as political leverage, such as Julius Caesar who was elected as Pontifex before holding a single political office (Ross Taylor).
Over time, however, the power of the Pontifical College and the Pontifex Maximus was diminished and became increasing subject to the violent political forces of the Late Republic. The dictator Sulla removed the Lex Domitia – the direct election of pontiffs by the comitia of the Roman people – and placed the election at the hands of the Pontifical College. This was undone later by the Lex Labiena, though Lily Ross finds that there was no change under Sulla and that Caesar solely supported the Lex Labiena to gain popular favor. Another restriction to the Pontificate was the Lex Papia that prohibited the Pontifical College from directly selecting a Vestal Virgin: instead, the Pontifex Maximus recommended names to be selected by lot at a public Roman contio (Mekacher and Van Haeperen).
At last, with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, the ensuing civil wars, and Augustus’ election in 12 BC as Pontifex Maximus (Cameron), did the unification of the Pontifex Maximus and secular power occur. As Emperor, Augustus expanded the power of the Pontifex Maximus over all religious colleges that were not subject to the purview of the Pontifical College (such as mystery cults) (Cameron), and enshrined the power of both Emperor and Pontifex Maximus in the Imperial cult. The Emperor as Pontifex Maximus continued long into 4th and 5th century, despite the advent of Christianity and the Christian appropriation of pontifices to name their bishops. Cameron points out that the bishop of Rome in the AD 360s was pontifex summus, and not maximus. Furthermore, Christian emperors did not shy away from the title of Pontifex Maximus, until, perhaps, the Emperor Gratian in AD 382, where inscriptions begin to state imperial nomenclature not as Pontifex Maximus, but as Pontifex Inclitus (Cameron). Whatever the case may be, the situation of Late Antiquity demonstrates the process in which Church hierarchy begins to shed off the influence of imperial power that will culminate in the investiture conflicts of the Middle Ages (Concordat of Worms) and the Renaissance.",-712,380,872,733,Juan Dopico,2020-09-06 03:09:34.526 +0200,2020-09-16 00:46:38.720 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
994,"Monastic Communities of Lower Egypt: Nitria, Kellia, Scetis",43,Religious Group (v6),"Ascetic practices had been rich and varied from the beginning of Christian history.  In the first few centuries CE, precedents were established for some of the ascetic practices and goals monasticism became known for, such as the existence of communities of ascetic practioners living according to common spiritual goals, and the movement from populated centers to the outskirts, for reasons that included (but were not limited to) seeking peaceful environments for spiritual contemplation.  Christianity became officially recognized as a legal religion under Constantine in the early fourth century, and this policy change allowed the freedom for new modes of Christian practice and social organization.

In late third- and early fourth-century Egypt, new forms of Christian ascetic practice arose in the forms of eremitic, semi-eremetic, and cenobitic monasticism.  Eremitic monasticism, engagement in a solitary lifestyle devoted to spiritual pursuits apart from society, gained notoriety with the wide circulation of the Life of Antony by Athanasius, the archbishop of Alexandria.  Over time, influenced by reports of Antony, who lived alone for years in increasingly remote and challenging locations, battling demons and attaining a rare level of spiritual transformation, thousands of people, following his example, moved into the desert.  The three areas described in this entry were major centers for this new semi-eremitic monastic way of life.  (Compare these forms of monasticism with cenobitic monasticism, a more fully communal lifestyle, as represented by Pachomian monasticism, which is described in detail in a separate DRH entry.)

Amoun is credited for founding Nitria, about forty miles southeast of Alexandria (near modern al-Barnuji).  This site grew quickly to include not only monks seeking a spiritual life removed from society, but additionally, supportive visitors and other travelers who would stay in the area, with the result that over time, a tourist industry of sorts sprang up in the area.  This influx of visitors encroached on the monastic goal of a lifestyle of peaceful meditation, and some monks decided to move farther into the desert, into the area of Kellia (which means “the cells”).  A story is told about Amoun and Antony determining the location of the new site within a day’s walk of Nitria (about twelve miles away), far enough to achieve the remoteness desired, but close enough to facilitate visiting between the two communities (APalph Antony 34).  South of Nitria and Kellia is the area of Scetis, founded around 330 by Macarius of Egypt (so-called to distinguish him from Macarius of Alexandria) around a series of saline lakes (modern Wadi el Natrun).  All three locations are associated with niter/natron, a salt compound used in embalming, cleaning, and Egyptian faience.  These communities thrived and achieved wide renown as tales of their practices and inhabitants spread and inspired others across the Roman Empire during the fourth and fifth centuries.  Beginning in the early fifth century, a series of raids by desert nomads caused destruction to these communities, and initiated a slow decline.  Nitria was abandoned by the seventh century, and Kellia by the ninth.  Monastic activity waxed and waned over time in Scetis, with monastic activity still there in the present day.  The date range I cite for this entry (330-470 CE) is based on the estimated chronological limits for the primary evidence I am drawing from in answering the questions below.

The Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Fathers) preserves collections of sayings across multiple versions (notably the Alphabetical Collection [APalph], arranged by the name of the speaker named, the Systematic Collection [APsys], arranged roughly by topic, and the Anonymous Collection [APanon]), and in several languages.  (Note that because of this complicated source set, my AP citations below correspond to the numbering of commonly available English translations instead of critical editions, with the intention that a wider and more general readership can more easily track these down if interested.)  The sayings tend to follow the pattern of wisdom literature: short and pithy sayings intended to teach a moral lesson. Many come as responses to requests such as, “Abba, give me a word,” and “Abba, how can I be saved?”  Some are short dialogical narratives, often between a younger monk and a more experienced monk.  The majority (but not all) of these sayings are associated with residents of Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis, the last with the highest proportional representation.  These sayings were passed down and circulated through oral tradition and finally recorded probably in the late fifth century in Palestine.

In this entry, I am going to use the shorthand description “Nitrian Desert communities” to refer to Nitria, Kellia (with Pherme), and Scetis instead of listing them individually when I mean to refer to all of them.  This is not to say that there were not significant differences among people, practices, and social norms in these distinct areas; in fact, there were.  But rather, these can be grouped together meaningfully under one heading for two main reasons: 1) There is a recognizable monastic culture that is shared among these areas, partially because of the close social ties and visiting practices among them that fostered a coherent cultural and even social unity despite their geographical spread, and 2) the Apophthegmata Patrum, the largest single source (or more accurately, set of sources) of information about these communities, draws from their combined cultural group as a meaningful unit.",330,470,1150,818,Tola Rodrick,2020-09-08 16:58:32.904 +0200,2020-09-24 00:07:04.925 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
995,Tamil Neo-Saivism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Generally understood to emerge with the teachings of the Tamil Sri Lankan religious scholar Arumuga Navalar (1822-1879), Tamil neo-Saivism is a discrete, reformist strain of Saiva Siddhanta Hinduism that has had wide-reaching influence on Tamil Hindu religious life and modern Tamil cultural thought in the Tamil cultural regions of South India and northern Sri Lanka (i.e., Tamil Elam). Some key features of Tamil neo-Saiva thought and practice include a frequent theological and scholastic focus on autonomous, ""Dravidian"" Tamil cultural identity and history relative to Brahmanical, Sanskritic, ""Aryan"" Hinduism; an explicitly monotheistic theology centered on the Hindu god Siva (Tamil civaṉ, Sanskrit Śiva; spelled Siva in this entry in deference to English-language neo-Saiva spelling conventions); and a particular connection with the Vellala caste community, a non-Brahmin Tamil caste community especially culturally influential and prestigious in pre-colonial Tamil society. Key to the intellectual development of neo-Saivism was the efflorescence of Tamil literary and historical scholarship associated with the Tamil Renaissance of the closing decades of the 19th century. Vellala Neo-Saiva scholars were at the forefront of historical scholarship that sought to investigate the culture, history, and social norms of an indigenous, pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the ""rediscovery"" of a wide range of ancient Tamil literature in the latter half of the 19th century offered a rich body of evidence for both theological and scholastic arguments about Tamil cultural identity. In opposition to the Sanskritic Brahmanical Hindu tradition, which attained an unprecedented degree of political and social influence in the Tamil country under British colonial rule, Tamil neo-Saivism eschews Sanskrit-language religious literature and Vedantic theology, instead recognizing a canon of Tamil-language texts and hymns including classical Tamil poetic literature from the Sangam period, the Saivite Tamil bhakti poetry of the Nāyaṉār poet-saints (6th-8th CE), and a variety of Tamil-language tantric and agamic texts with ties to non-Brahmin Tamil temple worship practices. Reversing the claims of Brahmanical Hinduism, Tamil neo-Saivism asserts that the worship of Siva is native to pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the Brahmanical tradition is a subsequent corruption of originally Tamil religious teachings. A resulting priority in neo-Saiva theology and scholarship is the re-establishment of putatively original Tamil religious, social, and cultural mores, a project through which religious ideas became linked to a distinct cultural politics.

997,Ancient Egypt - Early Dynastic Period,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Early Dynastic Period in ancient Egypt includes the first and second dynasties. This covers the cultural period of Naqada IIIc-d, and approximately 2950BCE-2670BCE (though these exact dates are debated). During this period, Egypt was politically united, and we therefore have a true Egyptian state. Throughout the history of ancient Egypt, the concept of religion does not seem to have been debated. The gods were an assumed part of life, and individuals were expected to make offerings to the gods and participate in religious festivals. In this way, the entire population can be considered part of the religious group. Much of the iconography and burial practices from the previous Predynastic Period continued into the Early Dynastic, though there were a number of additional advances. While there are more numerous examples of writing than previously, largely in the form of objects inscribed with royal names, most of what we know about Egyptian society and beliefs at this time is based on interpretations of the material evidence.",-2950,-2670,535,707,Caroline Arbuckle,2020-09-23 20:18:34.046 +0200,2020-12-09 00:00:24.317 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1005,Religion in Elam,43,Religious Group (v6),"It is important to distinguish an official Elamite religion, which appears through the texts, archeological evidence and many other sources such as artwork, and the reality of the Elamite religious practices. As a multicultural kingdom in which many nomadic and settled people have mingled through time, Elam does not possess a monolithic pantheon and frozen rigorous beliefs, it has evolved a lot due to external influences from Mesopotamia, Luristan or even Egypt, and to internal policies established to unite the plains of Susa and the mountains of Anshan. 

The lack of sources prevents researchers from knowing how the Elamite religion was really practiced by people and most of the knowledge relates to the state religion. Even if sacred texts were not found, a main pantheon was delineated with gods and goddesses associated with major symbols such as the underworld for Inshushinak or the sky for Napirisha for example. Other gods were added to this pantheon when nomadic tribes settled in Elam, like Adad, or when Mesopotamian people came to Elam bringing their own beliefs and practices. Thus, the Elamite religion as it is known currently is more of a state religion than a reality which most likely consisted in a patchwork of many influences with syncretistic beliefs. 

The first mention of Elam in written sources comes from the Akkadian empire around 2600-2500 BCE and the very first god quoted is Simut, the herald god of Elam, in the name of a vice-king of Elam, Sanam-Simut, under the reign of Lukh-khisshan, king of Awan and contemporary of Sargon of Akkad. Then, some other striking examples of an Elamite state religion appear during the kingdom’s apogees : a statue of Narrundi under the reign of Puzur-Inshushinak around 2100 BCE (he was a king who tried to create Elam’s own language, currently known as paleo elamite, and who conquered the plains of Susa, taking it back from the Akkadians), the city of Dur-Untash built by Untash-Napirisha at the end of the 14th century BCE (it was a political attempt to unite Susa and Anshan together through a religious unification, bringing Napirisha and Inshushinak in the same temple, but it didn’t last long) and finally the Shutrukide dynasty during the 12th century BC (which left many evidence of religious buildings and dedicated artworks like the Sit Shamshi). The end of the Elamite religion is as blurry as the end of the Elamite kingdom, as the Achaemenids had assimilated many practices from them and talked about Elamite gods in texts found at Persepolis, but it might have persisted a bit during and after the transition from a kingdom to another around 531 BCE.",-2600,-539,1159,837,Elie Burlet,2020-10-23 16:38:34.169 +0200,2020-12-11 01:08:56.170 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This was the period of Egyptian history when pyramid building was a central feature of the cult of kingship. This is the first period of Egyptian history when there are substantial textual references that provide more detailed insight into religious practice. At this point in time, the king was considered the ultimate intermediary between mankind and the gods. The kings built monumental tombs - most of them in the shape of pyramids.

The evidence for this period suggests that there was considerable experimentation with the creation of religious objects, which were not accessible to a larger proportion of the population than previously.

1010,Pythagoreanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pythagoreanism, like some of the East Asian movements that it eerily recalls, lies somewhere between philosophy, mysticism, and religion. Rooted in the teaching of the sixth century BC philosopher Pythagoras, the movement spread across Southern Italy and eventually into a modest portion of the Greek world, taking with it a strange hodgepodge of beliefs emphasizing ascetism, number symbolism, and the immortality of the soul. 
Pythagoras himself was certainly a historical figure. Born on the Aegean island of Samos around the middle of the sixth century BC, Pythagoras migrated to Croton on the boot of Italy around 530. It was there that he founded his school while also playing an important role in the politics of Magna Graecia. Pythagoras is thought to have died in Metapontum, to which he escaped as a refugee after a violent popular backlash directed at him and his followers.
Though today Pythagoras is often remembered as a man of science and mathematics (primary school students are invariably first exposed to him through the Pythagorean theorem which he discovered), in antiquity and even during his own lifetime he was also very much seen as a “holy man.” He was often identified with the Hyperborean Apollo, was said to have had a golden thigh, and allegedly claimed to remember his previous incarnations. Classical and post-classical authorities depict him acquiring his impressive knowledge and abilities while traveling in Egypt and the East. Such early accounts are almost invariably fanciful – in some legends Pythagoras is said to have proved the immortality of the soul by descending to the underworld – but it is not impossible that an Ionian of the sixth century should have brought together elements of Babylonian mathematics, Persian religion, and Indian philosophical doctrines.
The Pythagorean life was based on strict rules that regulated all aspects of existence from diet and clothing to intellectual activity. These rules (called akousmata or symbola) were, at least at first, based on oral teachings of the master; initiated members were called akousmatikoi and lived in tight-knit communities (which were apparently open to women as well as men). Among the most prominent rules was vegetarianism based on the doctrine of metempsychosis (that is, the transmigration of the immortal soul). Other rules emphasized ascetism, harmony, justice, and moral purity.
By the end of Pythagoras’ life, Pythagorean societies across Magna Graecia were subject to increasingly violent attacks, and around 450 BC Pythagorean power in Croton came to an end. The movement began to fray and was eventually split into two parts: the religious akousmatikoi who continued to follow Pythagoras’ oral teachings, and the scientific mathematikoi who chiefly pursued mathematical and cosmological learning. Many Pythagoreans became mendicants or migrated to other parts of the Greek world, whether in Italy or mainland Greece. Pythagoras’ teachings were thus widely disseminated. As a religious movement, the Pythagoreans seems to have had an abiding influence on several cults, especially that of the Orphics, with whom their doctrines coincided on several important points (especially vegetarianism and their belief in the immortality of the soul). Pythagorean thought also had an important influence on philosophers such as Philolaus in the late fifth century BC and Plato in the fourth century BC. In the first century BC, the Pythagorean movement was revived in Rome by Nigidius Figulus. Around the same time, the Platonist Eudorus in Alexandria attributed to the Pythagoreans a supreme One, and this monistic Platonism was soon developed by the so-called Neopythagoreans: Moderatus of Gades in the first century CE, Nicomachus of Gerasa and Numenius of Apamea in the second century CE. This movement eventually influenced the Neoplatonism of Plotinus in the third century CE. Porphyry and Iamblichus both wrote lives of Pythagoras, representing the founder of Pythagoreanism as a larger-than-life holy man and as the precursor to much of Platonic philosophy. Despite this enduring popularity of Pythagorean ideas, however, it is disputed whether religious Pythagoreanism survived in any meaningful way after the classical period. It was during this period that the Golden Words, a collection of life rules attributed to Pythagoras himself, surfaced in written form. And though pseudoepigraphical Pythagorean writings continued to be produced throughout the Hellenistic period, religious Pythagorean communities – always something of a fringe movement – would never regain the importance and popularity they had in the sixth and fifth centuries BC.",-530,200,1163,841,Avi Kapach,2020-12-01 16:19:09.596 +0100,2020-12-29 15:34:24.708 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1011,Kingdom of Edom,43,Religious Group (v6),"Edom appears to have had two major phases of activity during the Iron Age (1200–550 BCE). Early in the Iron Age activity and social complexity was focused in the lowland regions of the Arabah and centered in large part on the industrial exploitation of copper resources in the region. This period was marked by primarily mobile non-sedentary communities, and as such, lacks substantial textual or settlement data. This entry focusses on the second major phase of Edom, dated to the late Iron Age (ca. 750–550 BCE), where there is substantially more robust data. At this time Edom was centered in the highlands of southern Transjordan around a series of small settlements and agricultural villages, dominated by its foremost city of Busayra. The region yet retained a large mobile pastoral component. Substantial textual sources for this region are lacking, so much of the relevant data derives from short inscriptions and archaeological data. Similarities in lifeways, social structures, etc., between Edom and its neighbors to the north and west (Moab, Ammon, Judah), allows for relevant comparisons and extrapolations to be made, particularly concerning religious practices. Similar to the other Iron Age polities of the southern Levant, many gods are attested in Edom, though the deity Qos (Qaus/Qws) appears to have served as the foremost deity of the land, its populace, and of the ruling elite of Edom. Qos appears to have functioned as a local variant of the “storm god” and/or “divine warrior” type. Knowledge of Qos is primarily restricted to short inscriptions and names. Evidence for religious practices (to Qos and other deities) can be found in individual homes, at poorly understood regional ritual sites, at several shrines (Horvat Qitmit and En Hazeva) and in a large temple complex at Busayra that likely centered on the worship of Qos and presumably a consort.",-800,-550,1208,842,Andrew Danielson,2020-12-02 01:01:50.907 +0100,2022-01-21 22:03:04.663 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1024,Universal Salvation Ritual,43,Religious Group (v6),"Throughout pre-modern Chinese history, dynastic transitions accompanied by constant turmoil destabilized not only the social system but also social mentality. Wars, famine, and pestilence swept over the entire empire and left fields littered with corpses. The unpredictability of one’s fate was further aggravated by increasing concern about the unstable boundaries between this world and the other worlds, thus opening up the society to the possibility of ritual manipulation. Aiming at bringing about the deliverance en masse of the souls of the dead and conferring blessings upon the living regardless of age, gender, or social status, universal salvation rituals provided effective remedies for helping the souls of the dead to gain relief from the fate of postmortem punishment and restore tranquility to the living. The idea of “universal salvation” has long been a Mahāyānist Buddhist goal since early on in Chinese history. But it was during the late tenth century through the thirteenth century that it became prominent in both Buddhist and Daoist postmortem ritual services, such as in the Buddhist Water-Land Retreat (Shuilu zhai 水陸齋) and the Daoist Yellow Register Retreat (Huanglu zhai 黃籙齋) in particular. Still practiced nationwide in contemporary China as well as in some diasporic Chinese communities, both rituals had their origins in the tenth century, but their textual elaboration and social spread was a product of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Most contemporary performances of the Water-Land Retreat in mainland China and diaspora Chinese communities use a four-fascicle manual entitled Shuilu yigui huiben水陸儀軌會本 (Synthetic Manual of Water-Land Rite) which is based on a six-fascicle manual entitled Fajie shengfan shuilu shenghui xiuzhai yigui法界圣凡水陸勝會修齋儀軌 (Ritual Manual for Performing the Retreat of the Grand Assembly of All Saintly and Mundane Beings of Water and Land) compiled by the Ming Buddhist master Zhuhong’s祩宏 (1535-1615). But there is another Water-Land ritual tradition based on a ritual manual called Tiandi mingyang shuilu yiwen天地冥陽水陸儀文 (TDMY). The extant recension of the TDMY manual seems to have been compiled in Shanxi province山西 during the early decades of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) by a Buddhist monk named Yijin 義金 (act. ca. 1368-1424), who most likely based his manual on an earlier text that postdated the Northern Song dynasty and found great popularity under the Jurchen Jin (1115-1234).
The Daoist Yellow Register Retreat was primarily based on the Numinous Treasure (Lingbao靈寶) scriptural and liturgical traditions but had also absorbed elements of other contemporary Daoist movements such as the Divine Empyrean (Shenxiao神霄) and Celestial Heart (Tianxin天心) movements. The name of “Yellow Register Retreat” first appeared in one of the “Old Lingbao scriptures” (gu lingbaojing古靈寶經) called Taishang dongxuan lingbao huanglu jianwen sanyuan weiyi ziran zhenjing太上洞玄靈寶黃籙簡文三元威儀自然真經and later in Lu Xiujing’s 陸修靜 (406-477) Five Sentiments [of Gratitude] (Taishang lingbao wugan wen 太上靈寶五感文), where it is listed as one of the various Methods of Retreats (zhong zhaifa衆齋法) and second only to the Golden Register Retreat (Jinlu zhai金籙齋). Mainly composed of confessions made to the twenty directions, the principal function of the Yellow Register Retreat at that time was to uproot the sins and transgressions of ancestors of up to nine generations (ba jiuzu zuigen 拔九祖罪根). However, its full maturation as an independent liturgy was not to take shape until Du Guangting 杜光庭 (850-933) compiled the Liturgical Manual for the Yellow Register Retreat (Taishang Huanglu zhaiyi太上黃籙齋儀), which can be considered the culmination of medieval Daoist rituals for the dead. After that, the Yellow Register Retreat became a systematically organized and widely practiced liturgy that accommodated a great variety of needs, including state peace and prosperity, repose for the dead, salvation of restless spirits, exorcism of ghosts and demons, and so on. Throughout later generations, this manual became an authoritative source for the practice of Yellow Register Retreat and served as a model through the following three centuries.",1200,1920,1170,873,Jingyu Liu,2021-01-11 20:34:46.053 +0100,2021-04-22 17:40:10.989 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1026,Temple of Confucius (Kong Temple),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Temple of Confucius (Kong Temple) in Qufu is the principal site for the performance of Confucian ritual. Believed to occupy the home ground of Confucius (Kongzi), the place was maintained and revered through almost the entirety of China's dynastic history.
 
According to tradition the temple was established by Duke Ai of Lu two years after the death of Kongzi and was maintained during the centuries that followed by family members and local scholars. When the Han dynasty adopted Confucianism as a state orthodoxy in the second century BCE the temple began to receive state patronage. Although Kongzi had never belonged to the nobility he was nonetheless granted imperial rites as an ""uncrowned King"". That precedent would give rise to a centuries long debate over how to properly entitle the sage and his family members, and how to properly commemorate them through rites at his temple. Those titles and rites would have a direct impact on the character of the temple as it grew in scale and grandeur to match Kongzi's reputation. The temple was significantly upgraded in the Song dynasty, acquired its current configuration in the Ming dynasty, and reached its maximum extent in the Qing dynasty.
 
Kong Temple in Qufu is the first among many Confucian temples that once stood in virtually every county in China. Although none match the scale of the Qufu temple, all have common features that identify them as part of a wider ritual structure. Confucian temples necessarily include a main courtyard dominated by the Hall of Great Completion (Dachengdian) which holds the spirit tablets of Kongzi and his principal followers. The tablets of other Confucian worthies and notable scholars are arranged in galleries along the sides of the courtyard and the temple may also include memorial space for Kongzi’s parents. In Qufu the space includes a pavilion marking the site where Kongzi once taught his students, memorial architecture for his wife, and a display space for a narrative account of his life. Outside of the main gates a succession of courtyards holds hundreds of steles inscribed by emperors and high officials in praise of Kongzi, and a towering library hall that testifies to the scholarly associations of Confucianism. To the east lies the Kong Family ancestral temple and Kong Family mansion.  

With the collapse of the Qing dynasty in the early 20th century the temple was degraded and lost its ritual function. Narrowly escaping destruction during the Cultural Revolution, the temple has since been rehabilitated as a World Heritage Site. Together with Kong Mansion and the Kong Family cemetery (Kong Forest) Kong Temple remains one of largest and best preserved examples of Chinese ritual architecture.",-200,1900,1180,875,James Flath,2021-01-13 23:58:14.221 +0100,2021-09-28 01:53:08.338 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1028,German Pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz),43,Religious Group (v6),"The German Pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz in Hebrew) were a group of Jews who lived along the Rhineland in the towns of Speyer, Regensburg, Worms, and Mainz in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The German Pietists advocated strict observance of Jewish law and, subsequently, tended to avoided Jews whom they believed did not follow these precepts strictly enough. Members from this community produced religious works, including a compendium entitled Sefer Hasidim (The Book of the Pietists) that contains legal and social advice, often in the form of exempla, for its adherents. Despite stemming from a somewhat isolated group, Sefer Hasidim reveals much about the daily life of Ashkenazi Jewry, with its advice revealing economic, mystical, social, pious, and cultural concerns. The group’s foremost rabbi was Rabbi Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg, or Judah he-Hasid (Judah the Pious), who died in 1217, and to whom Sefer Hasidim is attributed. His followers included Rabbi Eleazer ha-Rokeah (“the Perfumer”) of Worms, who wrote an elegy for his murdered wife Dulce. This elegy has tremendous historical value for understanding the status of women in Jewish communities of Germany. The last active members of this group died by the middle of the thirteenth century.

1029,Zigao 子羔,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zigao 子羔 is a short text written on fourteen bamboo strips that was part of a collection of such texts purchased by the Shanghai Museum in three batches in Hong Kong in 1994. The texts were looted from a tomb by grave robbers and their exact provenance is thus unknown. Similarities with the collection of texts excavated near the village of Guodian 郭店 in Hubei province in 1993, suggest that the Shanghai texts may have come from Guojiagang 郭家崗 Tomb One near the village of Guodian, though there is no way to confirm this. The Shanghai texts likely date from around the same period as the Guodian texts (between 300 and 278 BCE) and the text of the Zigao itself was likely written in the 4th century BCE. The text itself features clear calligraphy but is partially damaged, with one fragment of the text currently housed in the collection of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The Zigao is written as a dialogue between Confucius (Kongzi 孔子) and his disciple, Zigao 子羔, and in its own time would likely have been considered a ru 儒 text. The term ru refers to a group of teachers and students who defined themselves by their adherence to the figure of Confucius, whom they took as their master. However, this group did not have a consistent philosophy and instead occupied a spectrum of intellectual positions based on shared ideas such as ren 仁 (“humanness”) and yi 義 (“righteousness”) as well as shared traditions such as the shi  詩 (“songs”), shu 書 (“documents”), and li 禮 (“rites”). 

In particular, the Zigao seems to have been part of an early debate over whether rulers should pass on the throne to their descendants or abdicate in favour of a worthy individual. The Zigao does not make an explicit statement regarding this issue, but focuses on comparing the sage-king Shun 舜 (who, according to legend, received the throne when the sage-king Yao 堯 abdicated) to the three figures of Yu 禹, Xie 契, and Hou Ji 后稷. These three figures were the progenitors of the Xia 夏, Shang 商, and Zhou 周 dynasties, respectively. According to the Zigao, they were also all “sons of Heaven” (tianzi 天子) because they were engendered through divine conception and born through miraculous births. While the text suggests that it was this divine origin that established the three dynasties as legitimate, it also states that, in ancient times, good rulers abdicated in favour of other worthy individuals and that none of the three dynastic progenitors were comparable to the fully human Shun (who had no divine provenance). The text, thus, advocates abdication and lays the foundation for future claims that Confucius was the “uncrowned king” (suwang 素王) by implying that he was the fully human sage most deserving of the position of king.",-325,-278,1174,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-01-18 21:12:19.629 +0100,2022-11-10 19:30:51.374 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1030,The Way of Tang and Yu (Tang yu zhi dao 唐虞之道),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Tangyuzhidao 唐虞之道 (The Way of Tang and Yu) is a bamboo text of twenty-nine strips that was part of a collection of such texts excavated from a tomb (Guodian Tomb One) near the village of Guodian 郭店 at Jingmen 荊門 in Hubei 湖北 province in 1993. The tomb itself was closed around 300 BCE and would have been located on the outskirts of Ying 郢, the capital city of the state of Chu 楚. 

The Tangyuzhidao cannot be definitively associated with any specific philosophical school in the Warring States period and is striking for constituting the only known argument to hereditary rule in Chinese history. According to the text, the only proper way to rule is for sage rulers to abdicate the throne to other sages when they become too old to rule effectively. In other words, rulership should not be transmitted through hereditary lineages but from one worthy ruler to another at a certain point in the ruler's life (age 70). The text illustrates this idea with the legend of the sage-king Yao 堯 (referred to by his lineage name Tang 唐) abdicating the throne to the sage-king Shun 舜 (referred to by his lineage name Yu 虞). The ""Way of Tang and Yu"" is thus the way of abdication and this phrase, which is first line phrase of the text, is used by the editors of the Guodian texts to refer to the text as a whole. 

The basis for the text's argument is the idea that the ruler (the ""Son of Heaven"" tianzi 天子) is necessary for the ""natural order"" (ming 命) to be harmonized. A good ruler is thus equivalent to the sun and the moon, essential to the flourishing of the world as a whole, and able to encourage the service of worthy individuals so that society is governed by sages at every level.  The text further argues that abdicating the throne is thus a sign that sages do not seek to monopolize the benefits of rule for themselves but are genuinely concerned with the welfare of all. As a result, it defines abdication as the fullest expression of both ""benevolence"" (ren 仁) and ""rightness"" (yi 義). The text further links these two virtues to the practices of ""loving one's kin"" (ai qin 愛親, a practice that is part of the virtue of ""filial"" piety"" xiao 孝) and ""honoring worthies"" (zun xian 尊賢) respectively and thus denies that there is any possible breach of kinship obligations in the practice of abdication. 

Although the text exhibits some parallels with other texts, including both Confucian and Mohist works, its argument is unique and its discovery sheds light on the types of arguments that the Mengzi 孟子 and Xunzi 荀子 were responding to when they offered their defenses of hereditary rule.",-325,-278,1175,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-01-19 05:00:05.621 +0100,2022-11-10 19:31:32.679 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1031,Eastern Roman Manichaeism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was born in third-century Mesopotamia (April 14, 216 AD), which, since 226 AD, was a part of the Sassanian Empire. Living in the pluralistic environment of Mesopotamia, the religion he instituted contains elements of many religious traditions with which he was familiar, such as Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Actually, Mani regarded himself as the last prophet in a long chain of prophets, which included Zoroaster, Buddha, and Christ.
The most notable feature of Manichaeism is its dualism. At the foundation of the Manichaean religion lies the doctrine of the two principles (also called roots or natures), which correspond to light and darkness, good and evil, spirit and matter. The Manichaean community itself consisted of two classes: the hearers or catechumens (the lay believers), and the highest echelons of the Manichaean Church, the Elect.
 Mani envisioned that his religion would surpass preceding ones by creating an ecumenical religion that would spread and unite the world.  Indeed, Manichaeism spread very rapidly through land and sea transportation networks, first in the Greco-Roman world (within a century) and later to the east, as far as China. In China, Manichaean communities continued to exist until the seventeenth century. In contrast, to the Roman West, it is argued that (at least as a distinct religious community) Manichaeism did not survive after the 6th century.
The current entry focuses on aspects of the religious and social identity and daily life of East-Roman Manichaeans.",300,600,1177,865,Rea Matsangou,2021-01-19 17:38:09.695 +0100,2021-04-16 22:37:52.386 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1034,Rongchengshi 容成氏,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Rongchengshi 容成氏 is a bamboo text of fifty-three strips, making it one of the longest Chu-script manuscripts yet discovered. Unfortunately, some of the strips are damaged and at least one strip is missing from both the beginning and end of the manuscript. While it has some parallels with the received tradition, the text has no exact counterpart and was thus previously unknown to scholars before its discovery. It was part of a collection of such texts purchased by the Shanghai Museum in three batches in Hong Kong in 1993. The texts were looted from a tomb by grave robbers and their exact provenance is thus unknown. Similarities with the collection of texts excavated near the village of Guodian 郭店in Hubei province in 1993, suggest that the Shanghai texts may have come from Guojiagang 郭家崗 Tomb One near the village of Guodian, though there is no way to confirm this. The Shanghai texts likely date from around the same period as the Guodian texts (between 300 BCE to 278) and the text of the Rongchengshi itself was likely written at the end of the 4th century BCE, a point indicated by its resemblance to ideas of the late 4th and early 3rd centuries. 
 
The text is a work of political philosophy that articulates its argument through an historical narrative that stretches from high antiquity to the beginning of the Zhou 周 dynasty. It is the only pre-Han 漢 dynasty work to offer such a narrative. Moreover, it is also unique among pre-Han works in attributing the practice of abdication to rulers of high antiquity. Other unusual features of the text include the fact that it advocates a  utopian vision in which all people are employed according to their abilities and that it presents a devolutionary reading of history in which society gradually declines from high antiquity through subsequent ages. 
 
The goal of the text is to advocate for a political system that will follow the features described above and in which a meritorious ruler will use lenient and frugal rule to achieve harmony with heaven and earth. The latter point is particularly important as it indicates a shift away from a prioritization of the mandate of Heaven (the idea that Heaven sanctions the ruling lineage) to a prioritization of harmony with heaven and earth. Because of its devolutionary scheme, however, the text does not advocate abdication but suggests that, within the benighted conditions of the contemporary age of the Warring States, rulers should achieve power by garnering the allegiance of the common people. 

A final important feature of the text is the unusual list of sages that it presents in its opening strips (the text’s title is based on the fact that the first of its listed sage-rulers is named Rongchengshi). While the text’s list has some parallels with other works, it is not an exact match. The names of many of the sages in the text’s sequence, along with other features of the work, suggest that it may be more representative of the regional culture of the state Chu 楚 than the common elite culture that Chu shared with the other states of the North China plains.",-325,-278,1179,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-01-22 21:05:46.065 +0100,2023-06-26 22:06:21.553 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1037,Third Intermediate Period in Ancient Egypt,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Third Intermediate Period is that represented by the 21st to 25th Dynasties of Egyptian history. It was a period of political disunity, when Egyptian territory was controlled by two or more contemporaneous lines of rulers, whose spheres of influence shifted over time. Some of these rulers held the status of kings, while others based their authority on their control of non-indigenous groups (Libyans and Kushites), armed forces and high religious office. For much of the period Egypt's political influence abroad was relatively weak, and the internal economy of the divided land was not conducive to the construction of elaborate monuments on the scale of those of the preceding New Kingdom. The evidence for religious attitudes indicates that there was continuity from preceding periods, and geographical consistency, with the same beliefs and practices being held by indigenous inhabitants and also by members of Libyan and Kushite groups dwelling within Egypt's borders. The Kushites also adopted Egyptian religious practices in their homeland (modern Sudan). Detailed textual sources for this period are scarce, monuments such as temples (or elements of temples) few and insignificant, and grave goods restricted in type and quantity. The main sources of data on religious attitudes are private statuary, stelae, coffins, funerary papyri and other burial goods.",-1100,-650,535,884,John Taylor,2021-02-01 13:43:23.281 +0100,2021-02-01 14:20:07.045 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1038,Sino-Muslims in Qing China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sino-Muslims in Qing China refers to Chinese-speaking Muslims who were natives in China proper and regular subjects of the Qing state. Their history can be traced back to the Tang dynasty (618-907) when Arabic and Persian merchants began to sojourn in China’s southeastern coastal area for trade. Many stayed and became Chinese subjects. After the Mongol invasion, large numbers of Middle Eastern and Central Asian Muslims further entered China proper during the Yuan period (1271-1368) through military campaigns and commercial activities. By the Qing (1644-1911), after several hundred years of reproduction, intermarriage, adoption, conversion (very limited), and internal migration, Muslims in China proper were already widely dispersed in villages and towns, in counties, prefectures, and provinces throughout the territory. In 1910, they had an estimated population of four to seven million.
Dwelling together with their non-Muslim (mostly Han Chinese) neighbors for long, these Muslims spoke Chinese, pursued Confucian social values, and embraced local customs practiced by Han Chinese. The Qing state found it too difficult to grant them with territory-based legal autonomy like what they did to Turkic Muslims and other ethnic minorities in borderlands. They were also not recognized by the state as a distinct category of imperial subjects, and were classified sometimes into the Han Chinese majority, and sometimes into Turkic Muslims. In occasions needing differentiation, the state might vaguely call them neidi huimin内地回民 (Muslim subjects in China proper) or hanhui汉回 (Han Chinese Muslims). For convenience of analysis, contemporary scholars refer to them as “Sino-Muslims.”
Despite their acculturation and their murky visibility in the state, Sino-Muslims in Qing China did not forsake or conceal their Islamic distinction in daily practices. They built mosques and Islamic schools throughout China proper. They travelled around in China proper and formed various types of transregional networks with co-religionists. They also widely published and disseminated Islamic scriptures and books written in the Chinese language. By the early 19th century, dispersed Sino-Muslims had been sharing common memory, knowledge, and discourse, etc. which contributed to a sense of collectivity rising among them, transcending regional differences within China proper. It distinguished them not just from non-Muslims in China proper, but more substantially from Muslims outside China proper. In terms of religious affiliation, most Sino-Muslims in Qing China belonged to Gedimu (the traditional Hanafi school of Sunni Islam in China). A small number of them (primarily in the northwest) began to be converted to Sufi sects since the early Qing period when Sufism was coming into China.",1644,1911,1183,876,Shaodan Zhang,2021-02-02 19:39:16.803 +0100,2021-09-28 02:31:27.427 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1039,(Archaeology of) Religion in New Kingdom Nubia,43,Religious Group (v6),"In the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1070 BC), the ancient Egyptians colonized Nubia, the area which today comprises the south of Egypt from Aswan and the north of Sudan until Khartoum. Egyptologists have traditionally believed that, in this period, Nubians had been 'Egyptianized'. This presupposed that Nubians fully adopted Egyptian culture, consequently converting to Egyptian religion. In the New Kingdom, following an initial period of military expansion and conquest, the ancient Egyptians reoccupied previously built fortresses in Lower Nubia and erected temple-towns across Lower and Upper Nubia. These temple-towns included a temple and other cultic spaces, administrative and housing areas and associated cemeteries. Evidence for religion in New Kingdom colonial Nubia comes from three different levels: the temple (state religion), houses/workshops/magazines (personal piety) and cemeteries (mortuary beliefs and practices). From an archaeological viewpoint, an overall substitution of local Nubian to Egyptian styles and patterns is apparent. However, today, archaeology is revealing a more complex context of cultural interactions between Egyptian colonisers and Nubian populations, including negotiations of identities and cultural entanglements. Moving away from previous colonial perspectives based on ideas such as acculturation, today archaeologists emphasize Nubian agency in the adoption, choice, refusal and maintenance of cultural patterns, which includes religious affiliation. Therefore, it remains hard to determine whether local populations converted to Egyptian religion or not, especially as today we accept that artefacts behave in different ways independently of how they look like. Egyptian-style temples, houses and material culture offer us glimpses of religious experiences in New Kingdom colonial Nubia. However, only a contextual approach allows us to detect religious affiliations in the light of complex and diverse processes of cultural perpetuity and change in colonial Nubia.
Temples were dedicated to Egyptian deities, most importantly Amun-Ra (e.g., Jebel Barkal), but also Hathor (e.g., Mirgissa), Horus (e.g., Buhen), the deified pharaoh (e.g., Soleb temple didicated to Neb-Maat-Ra, Lord of Nubia) and even the Aten during the Amarna Period (evidence from Sedeinga, Sai, Sesebi and Kawa). Around 50 temples dedicated to Egyptian deities were found in Nubia. Temple ritual involved offerings to the gods (based on iconography), including incense and food (conical bread moulds are usually associated with temples) and votive offerings to Hathor at Mirgissa. Sai has been suggested as a solar cult centre: a non-funerary pyramid located in the New Kingdom cemetery on the island has been interpreted as a solar temple. Priests and other personnel associated with temples in New Kingdom Nubia lived in settlements across the Middle Nile and are known from titles on inscribed objects and architectural remains from settlements and cemeteries. Beyond cultic spaces, New Kingdom temples in Nubia also included a series of functional areas.
Evidence for household religion includes pottery (incense burners with resin and offering platters), faience bowls potentially associated with domestic shrines, ancestor busts (which suggest a similar practice to Egyptian ancestor cult at home), female figurines usually assciated with fertility rituals, and various amulets/pendants representing deities etc. Animal figurines (namely cattle), typically of previous Nubian cultures, are sometimes found at New Kingdom settlements.
Evidence from cemeteries point to commemoration and memory during funerals, when graves goods would be displayed to the community. Ritual displays would allow people to express cultural affiliation. Offerings of food and beer were placed in tombs, as well as oil/perfume. Animal sacrifices are occasionally found, a typical Nubian practice. Pouring black resin onto bodies, coffins and other objects, including canopic jars, was also part of the funerary ritual. This would point to mummification practices, although no mummified human remains were found in Nubia. Bodies were wrapped and placed in coffins. Remains of shrouds and the position of body members suggest manipulation of the body to fit communities' expectations of death. Grave goods included coffins (not often preserved), jewellery, cosmetic items, tools, and more specialized items such as shabtis and heart scarabs. The Egyptian Book of the Dead usually appears on these objects, but it is difficult to determine if Egyptian mortuary texts in Nubia indicate any Osirian beliefs locally. The position of certain objects around the body and the special placement of amulets in the hands or around the neck of individuals suggest some intention to protect the dead for the afterlife.",-1550,-1070,1184,861,Rennan Lemos,2021-02-02 19:59:32.279 +0100,2021-02-03 17:21:14.118 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Tutankhamun seems to have died unexpectedly, and the cause of his death has received significant speculation. While this king is one of the most famous individuals from the long history of ancient Egypt, it is not due to fantastic feats or accomplishments. Indeed, Tutankhamun did not reign very long and accomplished relatively little. He is famous instead, because of his tomb. His tomb is the only well preserved, (mostly) intact royal tomb from ancient Egypt. It is located in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes. Discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, this tomb was filled with an incredibly rich hoard of treasure. It was given the designation ""KV 62"" as tomb number 62 in the King's Valley.

1041,Korean Catholicism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Catholicism first entered Joseon Korea in the early seventeenth century through books written by Western missionaries and their Chinese colleagues brought back by Koreans who had traveled to Beijing as part of government tribute missions. While some Korean scholars were interested in the science and technology contained in those books, they rejected the religion. However, in the latter part of the eighteenth century some reform-oriented scholars who questioned traditional Neo-Confucianism began to take Catholicism more seriously, leading to the baptism of one of their number, Peter Yi Seunghun, in 1784. He would return to Korea and begin to baptize others, so that when the first priest (a native of China) entered the country in 1794, there were already several thousand Catholics, including members of all ranks of society. Though these first Korean Catholics were heavily influenced by Confucianism, for instance, hoping that God’s grace would help them become more filial children, the Catholic rejection of ancestor rites and challenging of traditional class and gender hierarchy with notions of spiritual equality, as well as their connection with foreigners, would lead to massive state-sponsored persecutions that would kill thousands between the late eighteen and nineteenth centuries. Though the opening of Korea in the last quarter of the nineteenth century led to the petering out of anti-Catholic violence, the Korean Catholic community would remain on the margins of society (and would face nearly complete destruction in the north following national division) until beginning around the 1960s when growth in the number of laity, nuns, monks, and priests; reforms from the Second Vatican Council that allowed the use of the vernacular language and other similar changes; increased educational and medical work; and highly visible participation in the democratization movements, led to a high level of familiarity and respect among non-Catholic Koreans. For instance, Cardinal Stephen Kim Suhwan would publicly challenge the dictator Park Chunghee for his violation of human rights and Thomas More Kim Dae Jung in 1996 was a key leader in the democratization movement and his election to the presidency marked the triumph of democracy in the Republic of Korea as it involved the peaceful transfer of authority between a party in power and one that had been out of power. While Catholicism has sufficient numbers and respect to make it highly visible in Korea, like other religions it is being impacted by demographic decline. Moreover, while considered progressive on issues of democratization, as issues of sexual morality are increasingly becoming objects of debate in Korea, the traditionalist stance of the Catholic Church might lead it to have more conflict with society. As in other parts of the world, Catholic devotional life focuses on such practices as attendance at Mass, reception of the sacraments, and recitation of the rosary. Notable characteristics include the comparatively larger choirs in parish churches (Korean Catholics tend to be excellent and exuberant singers), the importance of domestic pilgrimage (made possible by the large number of holy sites created by persecution), interest in saints (again, a product of persecution), and the dignified solemnity of liturgical practices (which are in part an inheritance from Confucianism).",1600,2021,1188,886,Franklin Rausch,2021-02-12 19:50:31.710 +0100,2021-02-22 14:46:53.898 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1042,Zichiji 資持記,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This entry aims to document Zichiji, a commentary of Dharmaguptaka Vinaya (Buddhist monastic rules) written by Yuanzhao (1048-1116). Zichiji is a secondary commentary based on a root commentary of Daoxuan’s (596-667) Sifenlü shanfan buque xingshichao (Xingshichao). Divided into 16 volumes, it is a complete commentary of Daoxuan’s original work, which is based on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. Like Xingshichao, Zichiji refers to various Vinaya-related texts and Buddhist materials and is intended to be used as a comprehensive guide to the Buddhist monastic way of living. Zichiji covers a wide range of monastic practices and management, such as ordination ritual, repentance ritual, funerary practices, daily management of the monastery, and the relationships with laypersons. Unlike Xingshichao, it includes valuable information on the Song Buddhist monasticism and Yuanzhao’s debate with other Vinaya masters in his time. In terms of the transmission history of the text, multiple historical sources record that Zichiji was canonized during the Southern Song period. However, we do not have a material copy of any Buddhist canon which contains this text. The current canonization of the Zichiji can only be traced to the modern compilation of Zokuzōkyō in 1902. The popularity of Zichiji is a symbolic mark for the beginning of an institutionalized Vinaya school in China. A litter earlier than Zichiji, Yunkan’s Huizhengji (not extant) was a parallel work circulated in the Northern Song. Yuanzhao and Yunkan demonstrated different interpretations of Daoxuan and the Vinaya. After the Yuan Dynasty, Zichiji, together with other commentaries written by Yuanzhao, did not survive in the continent. It has been preserved in multiple monastic libraries and archives in Japan, such as Otani University library, Seikado Bunko Library, and Kanazawa Library, and brought back to China in the modern period. The preservation of Zichiji bespeaks active Buddhist communication and exchange on the Vinaya between China, Korea, and Japan in the medieval period during the 12th-14th centuries. Exchange among different countries became possible together with the reopening of the maritime trade route interrupted by the end of the Tang and the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Zichiji was studied in Japan as one of the foundational commentaries for the Vinaya and thus facilitated the Vinaya revival movement in Kamakura Japan. Yuanzhao, as the author of Zichiji, was commemorated as one of the patriarchs of the Vinaya school. In the modern period, Chinese Vinaya master Hongyi wrote an annotated version of Zichiji, and it has been further edited and published in China.",1078,1085,1248,869,xingyi wang,2021-02-14 21:10:56.423 +0100,2021-09-28 02:27:12.620 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1043,Islam in Aceh,43,Religious Group (v6),"Aceh enjoys a reputation as Indonesia’s “Verandah of Mecca,” a place of special piety and devotion to Sunni Islam.  With the confirmed presence of Muslims in the region by the 13th century, Aceh gave rise to one of the oldest Islamic kingdoms in Southeast Asia and emerged by the 1600s as a center of Muslim scholarship during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda and several female “sultanah” successors.  After the Dutch colonial invasion of the sultanate, Acehnese Muslims leapt to the forefront of religiously inspired resistance against colonialism during the long Dutch-Aceh War (1873-1914), established vibrant Islamic schools during the 20th century, and claimed “special autonomy” status in matters of religious administration in the aftermath of their incorporation into the newly independent Indonesian nation-state in 1945.  Since the end of Suharto’s “New Order” regime in 1998, Aceh continues to forge ahead with the implementation of a distinctive Islamic legal and bureaucratic system (Syariat Islam) as part of its special autonomy status. Within this general framework of Sunni Islamic piety, Acehnese Muslims have embraced varied religious practices, textual traditions, political affiliations and approaches to the interpretation of Islamic law.

1044,Han Imperial Cult under Emperor Wu,43,Religious Group (v6),"During the reign of Han Emperor Wu (141 – 87 BCE), the imperial government sponsored the worship of a large number of cults, many of which were connected to the emperor’s pursuit of immortality. Many of these cults were inherited from earlier, Qin, practice, others were adopted from regional cults of the former Warring States, and others were entirely new. Rather than being a formalized group of religious specialists/practitioners, Emperor Wu’s imperial cult, meaning cults sponsored by the emperor, is better understood as a collection of religious practices, which were brought together under the auspices of the Han court, in order to access powerful spirits for both the emperor and his empire. The cults worshipped by the emperor, or on his behalf, were spread out across the empire, and the emperor frequently travelled to perform sacrifices or visit sacred locations.
The number of cults grew over the course of Emperor Wu’s reign, and there were frequent changes to sacrificial locations and sacrificial rites. This period of imperial cult is thus characterized by experimentation rather than as a coherent cult with a standardized pantheon.
Emperor Wu’s pursuit of cult was closely connected to his pursuit of immortality as well as to his imperial ambitions – the two cannot be separated. We cannot say for certain what type of immortality the emperor pursued, whether it was the avoidance of death altogether or transcendence, or some combination of the two. It is evident that the emperor believed that one of the clearest paths to immortality could be found by emulating the sage rulers of antiquity, particularly the legendary Yellow Thearch 黃帝, Yao 堯, Shun 舜, and Yu 禹, as well as following precedent set by the First Emperor of Qin.  Significantly, the emperor believed that it was important for him to rule over a unified territory in order to perform the legendary Feng 封 and Shan 禪 sacrifices, which he was told, were performed by the Yellow Thearch before he became an immortal. As such, the emperor took over control of territory containing important cult locations, removing regional lords 諸侯 and kings 王 from governing over territories containing the Five Sacred Peaks 五嶽. The emperor also attempted to access the powers of local spirits, mostly in the eastern parts of the empire, to not only access their mantic powers, but to demonstrate his authority over the spirits and land of the empire. Emperor Wu sought the advice on spiritual affairs from both within his own court and by recruiting outsiders who claimed access to mantic knowledge. These outsiders, whom Sima Qian classifies as Fangshi 方士 (Masters of Methods), claimed to have specialized knowledge about immortality. Sima Qian, and others, were highly critical of the emperor’s reliance on these Fangshi, and many of the cults that they established were disbanded after the emperor’s death.
We have no information about the practice of these cults when the emperor was not involved, nor if they continued in some form after the period of imperial patronage.",-141,-87,89,870,Rebecca Robinson,2021-02-16 03:34:51.195 +0100,2022-01-26 22:15:23.022 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1048,The Sanctuaries of the Egyptian Gods at Delos,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"There are three sanctuaries dedicated to the Egyptian deities (Isis, Serapis, Anubis, Harpocrates, Osiris, Bubastis) in Delos. The first one is Sarapieion A and consists of a court and a small temple built on a vault accessible to water, two rooms of which one had benches, probably for the gatherings, and a portico. There is a long inscription known as the “chronic of the Sarapieion” and gives information about the origins of the sanctuary. According to this inscription, the founder of the sanctuary was the priest Apollonios; his grandfather Apollonios was the one who brought his god with him when he arrived from Memphis. Serapis appeared in a dream appointing where the sanctuary had to be built. It was probably private, and the office of the priest was hereditary. The Sarapieion B was not far from the previous one. It was constructed on a small terrace. It has been preserved only in ruins, and it once had a court, spaces with benches, a small temple, a tank, and altars. Unfortunately, not much is known about the history of the sanctuary. The Sarapieion C was the official sanctuary, the most important, and covered a large space from north to south on a terrace on the upper part of the tank of Inopos. It was close to the Sanctuary of the Syrian deities. The sanctuary was divided into two parts. A trapezoidal space with a paved road framed by altars and small sphinxes covers the south part. At the north, there is a paved court which is surrounded by cultic buildings: temples dedicated to Isis, Serapis, Anubis, and other buildings. Delos is the site that has offered the largest number of inscriptions dedicated to the Egyptian deities outside Egypt. These inscriptions reveal essential information on the offices; the sanctuary was served by a priest, a keykeeper, a νεωκόρος chosen among the citizens, an ἀρεταλόγος who proclaimed the miracles of the god, an ὀνειροκτίτης who interpreted the dreams etc. The same inscriptions enlighten on the customs and rules that devotees had to follow: wine was forbidden for the worshipers of Isis and Osiris, wool clothes were not allowed for the worshipers of Serapis.

The period experienced both continuity with Neolithic practices, as well as a suite of new ritual practices that reflect a transformation to the system of belief, which appears to have centered on the life cycle.  Characteristic features of the period include diversity in burial practices, new architecture, a rise in the regional production of ritual objects connected with new forms of craft specialization, and the development of a shared visual language on such crafted ritual objects. New beliefs about bodily treatment and rites of passage are expressed in the diversity of mortuary practices, which include intramural primary burials, subterranean burials, and extramural secondary burials in decorated ossuaries in caves. Regarding architecture, certain buildings at sites like Teleilat Ghassul, En Gedi, and Gilat have sparked debates about the function of these buildings, as either temples or mortuary shrines while the appearance of both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines raise questions about whether gods and goddesses were part of the ritual fabric of Chalcolithic society.",-4500,-3600,44,844,Nadia Ben-Marzouk,2021-03-03 20:10:54.025 +0100,2023-10-26 11:16:31.132 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1050,All Things Flow Into Form (Fanwu liuxing 凡物流形),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Fanwu Liuxing 凡物流形 (""All Things Flow into Form"") is a bamboo text within the ""Shanghai strips"" collection. This collection consists of a number of bamboo texts that were purchased by the Shanghai Museum (Shanghai Bowuguan 上海博物館) in 1994. Most likely, the texts were looted from a tomb and, as such, their provenance is unknown. However, similarities between the Shanghai strips and the Guodian strips excavated in 1993 suggest a tentative dating for the Shanghai strips of 300-278 BCE. For a more detailed description of the Shanghai strips, see the entry on the ""Zigao 子羔"" by Sarah Allan. 

The Fanwu Liuxing was previously unknown to scholars as it was not part of the ""received tradition,"" the body of textual materials passed down and recopied over the course of Chinese history. However, the Shanghai collection contains two manuscripts of the text, suggesting the early import of the text. Of the two manuscripts, one, Manuscript B, is damaged and the total length of the text is 30 bamboo strips. 

As with most excavated materials, the Fanwu Liuxing is not easily classified according to the ""schools"" rubric of later history. Instead of appearing as a work of Daoism, Confucianism, etc., the text appears to stand on its own as a cosmogonic work that endeavours to explain the cosmos according to a single origin that it terms the ""One"" (yi 一). Together with other excavated texts such as the Taiyi Shengshui 太一生水, Hengxian 恆先, and Guodian Laozi 老子, it thus appears to be representative of the ""cosmogonic turn"" in early Chinese thought, meaning the shift that appears to have occurred in early texts from advancing theistic explanations of the cosmos to advancing monistic and naturalistic explanations. 

Of these early works, the Laozi is the only one to have been passed down in the later tradition and appears to have been the winner of this early debate. The Fanwu Liuxing itself may have been excluded from the later tradition because its arguments were integrated into, and appropriated by, the Laozi in the course of its textual evolution. This process can be reconstructed through excavated versions of the Laozi, though later editing can obscure the evidence for in the received version of the text. 

More specifically, the Fanwu Liuxing is structured into two parts. The first contains a series of questions on a range of subjects, including the basic constituents of the world and how they take form, the nature of human beings and their formation, the relationship of human beings and ghosts with reference to sacrifices, concerns over rulership, specific aspects of the natural world, and various divinities (all of whom are subordinated to the original origin of the cosmos). 

The second part of the text provides an answer to these questions in the form of a description of the One and the way in which it both gives rise to the cosmos and also remains immanent within it so that it may function. The text emphasizes that, because the One is simply the totality of all things, it can be grasped through the senses and understood through the heart-mind. It concludes by arguing that  if a ruler is able to grasp the One through self-cultivation then he will be able to create political order. The text thus draws a direct line between its cosmogonic explanations and the practical exercise of political power.",-300,-278,1174,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-03-04 23:23:19.029 +0100,2022-01-25 21:57:49.189 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Over several centuries the demographics of this town changed considerably from an initial Egyptian planned settlement to a town inhabited mostly by the people of local and foreign Levantine origin. Eventually, the Egyptian government of the late Middle Kingdom lost control of its border provinces and a new state was formed in the Eastern Delta with Tell el-Dab'a (ancient Avaris) as its capital. The new rulers of the region belonged to an elite class known as the Hyksos. These men of foreign origin, judging by the names of most but certainly not all of them, ruled by taking over much of ancient Egyptian kingship ideology, titles and iconography. The location of the town, its close connections to the Middle Bronze Age Levant societies, and its rulers of foreign origin, also influenced its religious practices.",-1960,-1550,1296,903,Uros Matic,2021-03-04 23:43:31.747 +0100,2022-11-08 23:41:49.822 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1054,Wenzi 文子,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Wenzi 文子 refers to two separate, but related, Chinese texts, each of which is titled ""Wenzi."" 

|| The proto-Wenzi (a named coined by Paul van Els) is known through a bamboo-strip manuscript found in the ""Dingzhou Tomb"" near the village of Bajiaolang 八角廊  outside of Dingzhou 定州 city in Hebei 河北 province, China, which was first excavated in 1973. The Wenzi manuscript itself was later transcribed into modern Chinese characters and the transcription published in 1995. Based on certain features of its vocabulary and argument, it is likely that this text, which clearly bears the title of ""Wenzi"" on one of its strips, was written at some point during the Western Han 漢 dynasty (202 BCE - 9 CE) prior to the sealing of the tomb (the most likely date of which is 54 BCE). 
 
|| The proto-Wenzi is written as an anachronistic dialogue between King Ping (平王) of the Zhou 周 dynasty (r. 770-720 BCE) and the character of Wenzi 文子, who appears in the text as a political advisor. Wenzi has frequently been labelled as a disciple of Laozi 老子 in the later tradition - despite the absence of any information in the text itself regarding his identity. The dialogue covers a variety of subjects (such as warfare) that are related to statecraft. In all cases, the figure of Wenzi bases his advice to the king on a philosophy of quietude that, while milder in rhetoric, appears quite similar to that of the Laozi, a work the manuscript frequently references. A key difference is that, while the Wenzi follows the Laozi in basing its argument on the ""Way"" (dao 道, the source and natural pattern of the cosmos), the Wenzi also highlights the virtues of ""humaneness,"" ""righteousness,"" ""ritual propriety,"" ""sagacity,"" and ""wisdom"" as key components of rule. 
 
|| At some point in the 3rd century CE (marked arbitrarily in the comments below as the end of the Eastern Han, 220 CE), the text of the proto-Wenzi underwent an extensive process of revision that seems to have concluded by, at the very latest, the turn of the 5th century CE. This process of revision resulted in the ""received Wenzi."" (referred to below as both the ""received Wenzi"" and simply the ""Wenzi""). The received Wenzi has been subsequently transmitted in later history down to the present day, and exhibits consistent editorial patterns. 
 
|| To begin with, the dialogue between King Ping and Wenzi is changed into a dialogue between Laozi (the putative author of the Daodejing 道德經) and Wenzi, who is presented as a disciple of Laozi and not as a political advisor. King Ping appears only briefly in the text. His presence serves primarily to establish the period of time in which the text is supposedly written and to underline Laozi's authority as Wenzi's teacher. Similarly, the figure of Confucius is added to demonstrate Laozi's superior authority. 
 
|| Despite its nominal dialogical structure, the received Wenzi consists primarily of lengthy pronouncements from Laozi, thus making the text largely monological in style. Strikingly, most of the text's content actually comes from the Huainanzi 淮南子 (a Western Han text from 139 BCE that integrates a great deal of earlier material and treats the Daodejing as an authority) with approximately 75% of its content being directly taken from the Huainanzi. The purpose of these changes seems to have been to establish the Wenzi as an authoritative source of ideas associated with Laozi, presenting the text as a kind of prequel to the Daodejing and the Daoist equivalent of the Analects of Confucius (Lunyu 論語.
 
|| This effort was a successful one as the Wenzi became an extremely important text up to the end of the Northern Song (1127 CE). The high point of its influence was during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong 玄宗 (r. 712-756 CE) of the Tang 唐, who in 742 BCE canonized the text alongside the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi, bestowing on it the new title of True Scripture of Understanding the Mysteries (Tongxuan Zhenjing 通玄真經). Beginning in the Southern Song, however, the text ceased to be part of a lived tradition as it was increasingly criticized and eventually dismissed as a forgery.  This neglect persisted until the Dingzhou discovery described above, which generated a renewal of interest among scholars, though only as an object of study.",-202,2021,1195,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-03-06 01:44:44.689 +0100,2022-01-25 21:59:33.444 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1055,Taijitu shuo 太極圖說,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Zhou Dunyi 周敦頤 (1017-1073) has, since the late 12th century, been considered the ""founding father"" of the Song dynasty revival of Confucianism, which in the West has been called ""Neo-Confucianism."" Curiously, though, it took over a century for him to acquire that status, which was conferred on him primarily by Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130-1200), the chief architect of the Cheng-Zhu school of Confucianism (named after Zhu and his predecessor Cheng Yi 程頤 [1033-1107]). Although Zhou Dunyi was fairly obscure during his lifetime and had very few students to pass on his teachings, Zhu Xi found Zhou's concept of taiji 太極 (Supreme Polarity or Supreme Ultimate) useful in linking together the metaphysical and cosmological dimensions of his (Zhu's) system of thought and practice (see Adler, Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi). Thus, ever since the end of the 12th century, histories of Neo-Confucianism, in both East Asia and the West, have begun with Zhou Dunyi. 
	Zhou Dunyi's Taijitu shuo 太極圖說, or Discussion of the Taiji Diagram, accompanied by the diagram itself, is his most famous and influential work. The diagram was attributed to a 10th-century Daoist adept, Chen Tuan 陳摶 (d. 989). According to Zhu Zhen 朱震 (1072-1138) it was passed down to Zhou Dunyi through two generations of Chen Tuan's students – a transmission that has never been confirmed. In Daoist circles the Diagram seems to have been read from the bottom up as a guide to inner contemplation of the Dao within the human body, with phrases from the Xici 繫辭 (Appended Remarks) or Dazhuan 大傳 (Great Treatise) appendix of the Yijing 易經 (Scripture of Change) labeling the various stages. 
	Zhou Dunyi, in his ""Discussion,"" read the Diagram from the top down as a cosmogonical representation, from an undifferentiated unity to the interaction of yin 陰 and yang 陽, to further differentiation into the Five Phases (wuxing 五行), and ultimately to the myriad things. The second half of the Discussion presents the Confucian sage as the culmination of this cosmological process. Under the influence of Zhu Xi and his many students and followers, the Diagram and Discussion became the basis of Neo-Confucian cosmology, and Zhou Dunyi became universally accepted as the first Confucian sage of the Song dynasty; in fact the first true sage since Mencius in the 4th century BCE. The Diagram and Discussion are also found in the Daozang 道藏, or Daoist Canon.",1050,2021,1216,902,Joseph Adler,2021-03-06 21:06:37.927 +0100,2021-09-28 01:29:32.714 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1056,The ancient Egyptian Amduat - tomb of Thutmose III,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Amduat is a pictorial–textual composition which describes the nocturnal voyage of the sun-god and his entourage through the subterranean underworld, where he unites with the underworld god Osiris (representing an ""engendering principle"") and is rejuvenated before being reborn from the eastern horizon at dawn, re-enacting the original moment of cosmic creation.

The original title of the composition was the ""Writing/Drawing of the Hidden Space"". The common scholarly designation ""Amduat"" renders the generic Egyptian term ""scroll of that which is in the underworld"", which was assigned to later copies of this and several other compositions.

The tomb of Thutmose III (KV 34 in the Valley of the Kings in ancient Thebes, on the west bank of the Nile near modern Luxor) contains the earliest extant full copy of the composition in all three of its versions: a ""long"" version that combines descriptive text with images of entities inhabiting the underworld; a ""short"" version, without images, which summarizes the events of each hour; and a tabular ""catalogue"" (also termed an ""index"") of captioned figures appearing in the long version. The tomb of Thutmose III provides the only known example of the catalogue.

In the tomb of Thutmose III, the ""long"" and ""short"" versions of the Amduat are inscribed on the walls of the oval burial chamber in the tomb. The ""catalogue"" is inscribed on the walls of the antechamber leading to the burial chamber.

The ""long"" and ""short"" versions are divided into 12 sections, each describing (and depicting, in the case of the ""long"" version) the activities of the sun-god and his interactions with various underworld inhabitants in a region of the underworld. One region is traversed in each hour of the night between sunset and sunrise.

The Amduat is part of a broader category of cosmographic compositions termed ""underworld books"" or ""netherworld books"". Other members of this category include the Book of Gates, Book of Caverns, Books of the Earth, and the Enigmatic Books of the Solar-Osirian Unity. Closely related compositions are the cosmographic Book of the Day, Book of the Night, Book of Nut (also known as the Blueprint of the Course of the Stars), and the non-cosmographic Book of Adoring Re in the West (also known as the Litany of Re). Complementing these was a composition now termed the ""cult-theological treatise"" or ""king as sun-priest"" text, which has a similar focus on esoteric religious knowledge. All these compositions are known mainly from New Kingdom sources (mid- to late 2nd millennium BCE), with later copies from the 1st millennium BCE; some of them, such as the Amduat, Litany of Re, and cult-theological treatise, may have originated in the Middle Kingdom (early to mid-2nd millennium BCE), although the topic of dating continues to be debated.

Almost all New Kingdom copies of the Amduat come from royal tombs. The only known non-royal example is from the tomb of the vizier (highest-ranking administrative official in the Egyptian government) Useramun, who served under Thutmose III. Access to and circulation of the composition and/or its content remains debated. It likely originated in initiatory rituals for a restricted group, before being secondarily deployed in tombs due to its solar themes, which fit with intensive developments in solar theology (including hymns and ritual texts) and its mortuary significance during the early New Kingdom.",-1479,-1425,1196,894,Jordan Miller,2021-03-08 18:01:47.644 +0100,2021-04-01 15:53:09.937 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1057,Fuzi 傅子,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Fuzi is the major work of Fu Xuan 傅玄 (217-278), an influential official and prolific writer of Wei-Jin times. This work has been listed among the miscellaneous treatises; considering that its core thoughts are Confucian, however, there is still controversy regarding the category of Fuzi. Most parts of Fuzi were written as political advice for Sima Zhao (211-265), posthumously the Emperor Wen of Jin, on how to establish a new regime and manage potential issues such as avoiding riots and selecting talents. This writing purpose to some extent explains why it is hard to categorize Fuzi, as Fu Xuan borrowed and integrated many schools’ ideas that were valuable to statecraft, such as legalist law and order, Mohist economical style, Confucian morality and education. Thus, Jordon Paper has claimed that Fu Xuan is “Confucian in theory, semi-Legalist in application of theory.” Regardless which school he belongs to, Fu Xuan proposed several insightful strategies on statecraft. For example, his innovative tax policy combined three principles: fairness, economy, and regularity. He opposed Xuanxue’s specious style and promoted trustworthiness and honesty. He suggested banishing the death penalty to save labourers. He also advocated personal cultivation and virtue (de 德) for rulers and officials. Fu Xuan’s strategies and proposals on statecraft have been valued and applied by later scholars and politicians, which can be seen through their efforts to preserve the Fuzi.
	According to the Jinshu, the Fuzi originally had inner, middle, and outer sections, which included four categories and six records, totaling one hundred and forty pieces, on the following themes: statecrafts, history, and current affairs. The book itself was quite lengthy: it had  several hundred thousand characters and was about one hundred juan long. During the Tang dynasty, the Fuzi was still complete; after the Song, it started to disappear and by Ming times, there was no record of it. 
	During the Qing Dynasty, scholars produced several reconstructed editions of Fuzi. One of these is the Wuyingdian version (Wuying dian juzhen ben 武英殿聚珍本), compiled in 1774, which includes twenty-four sections mainly based on the Yonglu dadian 永樂大典, and forty-eight items (tiao 條) in a supplement. This edition was reproduced in the Siku quanshu huiyao 四庫全書薈要 and the Siku quanshu 四庫全書. Yan Kejun 嚴 可 均 (1762-1843) produced a four juan edition of the Fuzi in his Quan Shanggu saidai Qin Han Sanguo Liuchao wen. In Zhihai 指海, in 1843, Qian Xizuo 錢熙祚 formed a three juan edition of Fuzi. This edition is virtually copied in Ye Dehui's 葉德 輝 (1864-1927) Guangu tang suo zhushu 觀古堂所著書. In 1876, Fang Junshi 方濬師 (1830-1889) compiled the Fu Chungu ji: Fu Fuzi Jiaokan ji 傅鶉觚集 : 附傅子校勘記 in five juan. The first two juan and the supplement are about the Fuzi. 
Fuzi has been highly regarded in history. Wang Chen 王沈 (d. 266) who, like Fu Xuan, once worked on the Wei shu 魏書 (which became part of the Sanguo zhi 三國志), held the post of Minister of Works 司空, a leading position for those who excelled in literature. Commenting on the Fuzi he said, ""Examining the book that you [Fu Xuan] have written, Sir, [I find] that your expressions are well reasoned and useful, provide good policies, and preserve and revere the Confucian teachings. They are capable of thwarting the propagation of the philosophies of Yang [Zhu 楊朱] and Mo [Di 墨翟] and equal the philosophies of Xun [Zi 荀子] and Mencius of past generations.""  During the Tang Dynasty, the prominent official and historian, Wei Zheng 魏徵 (580-643), confirmed the Confucian values of Fuzi by selecting some of its chapters about government and politics for inclusion in his book Qunshu zhiyao 群書治要. The editors of the Siku quanshu 四庫全書 regarded the Fuzi as a Confucian work and acclaimed it in their Zongmu tiyao 總目提要: ""[The extant works of Jin’s philosophers consist of only Fu Xuan’s book; all of its discussions concern governing principles and explain Confucian teachings. [His] ingenious intentions and excellent speeches are everywhere. Thus, [I] believe both Lunheng and Changyan are inferior to this book. The book [contains] incomplete chapters and broken slips volumes. If we gather together its extant pieces, we still can examine and discover one-tenth [of its meanings]. This is indeed valuable.”",217,278,1197,909,XURONG KONG,2021-03-09 19:34:11.059 +0100,2021-09-28 01:55:35.276 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1058,Syŏnggyŏng chikhae kwang-ik,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Syŏnggyŏng chikhae kwang-ik (direct exposition of the Bible for widespread benefit) is a devotional text that was used by Korean Catholics from the birth of Korean Catholicism in the late eighteenth century to the modern period, during almost a century of persecution under the Chosŏn (1392-1910) regime. Specific authorship is unknown, but the text is presumed to have been translated communally by early Catholic leaders. 
The text is a vernacular Korean adaptation of three earlier Chinese Catholic texts (Shengjing zhijie, Shengjing guangyi, and Sheng nian guangyi), which were adapted from European devotional literature. It resembles a Sunday missal, with New Testament passages for each week of the liturgical year accompanied by commentary and prayers, and includes about thirty percent of the four Gospels, with Old Testament passages integrated without citation into many of the commentaries. 
Teaching about Jesus features prominently in the commentaries, and a secondary emphasis is soul salvation and the need for vigilance to attain heaven. Stories about saints and events from early Christian tradition, quotes from notables such as St. Augustine, and even maxims from pagan philosophers such as Seneca also appear. A linguistic feature highlighting the text’s transcultural origin is the occasional presence of a Koreanized European word, such as sibirido sando from the Portuguese espirito Santo (Holy Spirit), or belp’ŭng from the Latin verbum (word). 
Court records of books confiscated during arrests of Catholics suggest the text was widely read as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century. With little access to clergy during the period of persecution, Catholics in hiding relied on hand-transcribed religious texts such as this, read during weekly instruction at secret meeting places. State-sponsored persecution ended after a treaty with France was signed in 1886, and, in 1892, Gustave Mutel, the first bishop appointed to Korea, commissioned a new version of the text. Printed in movable type and renamed Syŏnggyŏng chikhae, Mutel’s version offered the original text tidied of marginal notations and supplemented by an occasional transliterated Greek term. This version was reprinted until 1938, and, along with Syŏnggyŏng chikhae kwang-ik, appears to have been read by Catholics until the Second Vatican council of 1965. 
As a product of persecution-era Catholicism, Syŏnggyŏng chikhae kwang-ik remained distinct from later Bible translations, such as the first Korean translation of the New Testament, produced in China in 1887 by John Ross, a Presbyterian missionary. Thousands of copies of the Ross New Testament circulated in Korea soon afterward as Protestant missions moved to center stage in Korea’s modernization, while Catholics remained concentrated in rural areas where they had been hiding from decades of persecution. The first complete Four Gospels commissioned by the Catholic Church and produced in 1910 was translated from the Latin Vulgate, and later Catholic and Protestant translations containing both Old and New Testaments were based on the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures. These texts differed from Syŏnggyŏng chikhae kwang-ik in style and wording as well, due to changes in the Korean language. In effect, used by Korean Catholics alongside newer Bible translations during Korea’s rapid modernization in the first half of the twentieth century, Syŏnggyŏng chikhae kwang-ik offered a unique link to the pre-modern, persecution era experience. 
Six hand-transcribed copies of Syŏnggyŏng chikhae kwang-ik dating from the late nineteenth century remain, archived in Seoul: four at the Church History Research Center, and two at the Chŏltusan Martyr’s Shrine. Each copy consists of eleven tomes bound in four paginated volumes, each volume averaging almost 700 pages, with 65 to 200 characters per page.",1780,1920,1198,887,Deberniere Torrey,2021-03-10 19:57:47.694 +0100,2021-04-08 02:48:33.134 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1060,The Taizhou Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Taizhou movement was initiated by a salt merchant, Wang Gen 王艮 (1483-1541), who came from Taizhou 泰州in today’s Jiangsu Province (North Zhili in the Ming). Wang Gen studied in a village school but dropped out after a few years due to poverty. He went to Shandong on business trips with his father. While visiting the Confucius temple in Confucius’ hometown Qufu, he had an enlightenment experience and became convinced that his own nature and the nature of the sage were identical.

Back in Taizhou, Wang Gen created a centre, where people gathered for singing, meditation as well as a philosophical debate. We find both firewood gatherers and men with the highest examination degree in the movement. Whether women were part of it must wait for further research. After developing his own ideas independently, Wang Gen became a disciple of Wang Yangming (1472-1529) for a while. Therefore, the Taizhou movement is usually seen as part of the larger Wang Yangming movement.
The ideas and praxis of the Taizhou movement are heterogeneous. Wang Gen proclaimed the idea of self-respect inspiring many people in his time. This idea is probably one reason why people still are fascinated by Taizhou learning, both in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. The idea of self-respect questioned the traditional Confucian moral values of sacrificing yourself for your ruler and parents. The debates the Taizhou practitioners organized concerned moral questions, such as how to show solidarity with other people. Wang Gen argued that if you do not love and respect yourself, you cannot love and respect others. But he also talked about protecting yourself, which gives the impression that he already intended to create an organization that might be perceived as a threat to society and that their members therefore would need protection. Like many other Neo-Confucians, he was critical of the examination system. Wang Gen, however, went further and argued that learning which does not give you a feeling of joy is not true learning. He composed a song called “Joyous learning” (Lexue Ge 樂學歌), where joyous learning is celebrated. Wang Yangming said that the essence of one’s mind or heart (xin 心) is joyous. For the Taizhou practitioners, this meant to learn to know one’s mind and protect oneself. This was done by meditation exercises and social organization. Since the civil examination was of no help for learning to know oneself, Wang Gen forbade his sons to take part in the examinations.

Some of the Taizhou practitioners were more moderate and others more radical. The discussion meetings are linked to the private academies, so free discussions might have started already in the Song dynasty (960-1279). In the Song, the academies were however strictly limited to the officials and people with examination degrees. AWang Yangming opened for spreading the message to simple men and women in the countryside, but it the Taizhou practitioners who realized it. With the Taizhou movement, commoners started to read and interpret the Confucian classics according to their own understanding, something which is similar to the Reformation when common men and women became religiously adult. The freedom of debate amont the Taizhou practitioners created a situation with different and contradicting ideas. Some could for instance argue against Buddhist rituals while others were very open to both Buddhist and Daoist ideas and praxis. As for their rituals, they were less hierarchical than the preceding Neo-Confucian. Rules for sitting, bowing and so on were also less strict.

Thanks to charismatic masters, the movement spread over China, from Taizhou in the East to Sichuan in the West, Hebei in the North and Guangdong in the South. Yan Jun 顏鈞 (1504-1596) and He Xinyin 何心隱 (1517-1579) made Jiangxi a new centre of the movement but also travelled around spreading the teachings. They confirmed desires, a step that was even more provocative than Wang Gen's idea of self-respect. Yan Jun established an “A hall for coming together in harmony” (Cuihe Hui 萃和會) and draw up rules for his community compact. He also led a seven-day meditation retreat, which includes breathing and meditation exercises with Daoist characteristics. He Xinyin’s “Society for collective harmony” (Juhe Tang 聚和堂) was something similar to Yan Jun’s society. It was a utopian society aimed at taking care of children, aged, and disabled members on a collective basis. The society organized schooling, capping ceremonies (a rite of passage for boys) and paid for funerals. They furthermore collected taxes within the society and delivered taxes to the authorities collectively. The Taizhou practitioners were famous for caring for their friends, and that applied especially to Yan Jun and He Xinyin. He Xinyin was accused of discarding the Confucian bonds between ruler and subject, father and son, elder and younger brother, husband and wife, only keeping the fifth bond between friends. Interestingly, the word they used for ’friend’,  tongzhi 同志, would later be chosen by the communists when translating the Western word “comrade” to Chinese. He Xinyin remonstrated when the local authorities imposed extra taxes on his community. This led to his arrest and imprisonment, but thanks to his friends he escaped and would change his name several times and travel from place to place lecturing wherever he went. It is at this time he took the name Xinyin 心隱 – the hidden heart.
Our knowledge about the Taizhou practitioners comes to a large extent from Huang Zongxi’s 黃宗羲 (1610-1695) work The Records of Ming Scholars, which was published in 1693. Huang Zongxi was a Ming loyalist and a proponent of the Wang Yangming tradition. Accusations during the early Qing dynasty that Wang Yangming and his movement caused the fall of the Ming led Huang Zongxi to blame the radicals of the Taizhou movement such as Yan Jun and He Xinyin to save the more mainstream Wang Yangming followers. However, reading the work by Huang Zongxi carefully it is clear that he is not without admiration for the Taizhou practitioners. That the school of Wang Yangming would have caused the fall of the Ming dynasty seem to be very unlikely. It had probably to do with totally different reasons such as the military strengths of the Manchu invaders or other more practical issues. 
The infamous thinker Li Zhi 李贄 (1527-1602) was inspired by the Taizhou message, but most Chinese and Western scholars do not regard him as a Taizhou practitioner. Li Zhi mentioned that He Xinyin was his teacher, but this was probably more in the sense of a spiritual teacher. Li Zhi has been called an arch-individualist and he was inspired by He Xinyin’s celebration of desires. However, Li Zhi also regarded Prime Minister Zhang Juzheng 張居正 (1525-1582) as his master, a person who was the opposite of He Xinyin as for ideals and way of life. The hatred between He Xinyin and Zhang Juzheng was mutual. Zhang might even have been the man who ordered the arrest and murder of He Xinyin. In 1579, the same year as He Xinyin was killed, Zhang Juzheng forbade the discussion meetings in the free academies, which was a heavy blow for the whole Wang Yangming movement. Li Zhi was deeply interested in Buddhism and left his family to live in a monastery. His eccentric lifestyle and provocative writings (especially his books ""A book to hide"" and ""A book to burn"") made him a target of harsh criticism. He was imprisoned and accused of immoral behaviour and seduction of people’s minds. The sources mention that he committed suicide in prison in 1602, but there are divergent narratives of this suicide already in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and, therefore, how Li Zhi died cannot be verified. Something which however is clear is that this kind of religious movement created great fear among men of power.",1500,1600,1225,908,Johanna Liden,2021-03-12 11:51:56.482 +0100,2021-09-28 01:57:53.615 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1062,"Shangshu 尚書 (""Higher Writings""; also, ""Documents"")",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Shangshu 尚書 (Higher Writings; also known as Book of Documents) is one of the foundational texts in Chinese history, and with a most complex textual history, as recorded in Han 漢 dynasty (202BCE–220CE) documents. The Higher Writings is a collection of speeches attributed to rulers and important ministers of the Zhou 周 dynasty (1046–256 BCE). It became one of the Five Classics 五經 during the Han dynasty (see Nylan 2001), i.e. one of the texts on which the imperial curriculum was based. Knowledge of these classics was prerequisite to assume any official position. While some chapters were put together after the fall of the Han dynasty, almost half of it are genuine compositions of early date, and present very challenging language. Wang Guowei 王國維, a most experienced scholars in the study of Chinese classics, admitted to understanding no more than half of them, and that it is true of previous scholars too,《詩》《書》(...) 於六藝中最難讀。以弟之愚闇，於《書》所不能解者殆十之五；於《詩》亦十之一二。漢魏以來諸大師未嘗不強為之說，然其說終不可通，以是知失儒亦不能解也。(In Guantang jilin 觀堂集林).

One of the loci classici to begin to understand the history of this text is the Treatise on Arts and Letters 藝文志, the oldest extant bibliography included in the Book of Han 漢書. In there, the Shangshu is presented as originally of 100 chapters (pian 篇) and a preface, of which only 28 survived. Han scholar Fu Sheng 伏生 (active second century BCE) is credited with having saved these 28 chapters from the burning of the books that occurred during the Qin 秦 dynasty (221–202 BCE), to which another one, the Taishi 太誓, was added. These became known as jin wen 今文 chapters, because they were written in clerical script (in use during the Han dynasty, hence “current script”). However, Fu Sheng was an official serving under the Qin, thus belonging to a category that could possess books. Hence this narrative poses a contradiction on why he needed to hide this text at all. 16 more chapters were recovered from in the wall of the once house of Confucius, when Prince Liu Yu 劉餘 (d. 127 BCE) started construction to enlarge it. These were written in a script that preceded the standardization of the script ordered by Qin minister Li Si 李斯 (circa 280–208 BCE), and became thus known as guwen Shangshu 古文尚書 (ancient script Shangshu). The Treatise seems to imply that a witch trial interrupted the establishment of an office for the study of these newly recovered chapters. In his memorial to Emperor Ai 哀 (r. 7–1 BCE), Liu Xin 劉歆 calls for the establishment of a boshi 博士 (“erudite”) position for the study of all texts in ancient, suggesting that these 16 guwen chapters were located in the imperial library. After this reference, we lose track of these 16 chapters. While the Book of Han most certainly refers to it as a somewhat defined collection, the Records of the Historian (which mentions a total of 68 chapters) seems to be using the term also to indicate a category of writing. 
____	
While Liu Xin’s collated edition of jinwen and guwen chapters seems to have remained within the library, the 29 jinwen chapters enjoyed wider readership, and were frequently referred to as Shangshu. As for many other texts during the Han dynasty, the Shangshu too presents different lineages and scholars who taught this text, most famously Ouyang Gao 歐陽高, Xiahou Sheng 夏侯勝 and his nephew Xiahou Jian 夏侯建. Thus, in the body of Han literature we have references to the Ouyang Shangshu 歐陽尚書, the Da Xiahou Shangshu 大夏侯尚書 and the Xiao Xiahou Shangshu 小夏侯尚書, however without extensive details on the textual differences that existed among these lineages. Of these, the Ouyang Shangshu was the most renown, and one for which one textual change is mentioned: Ouyang divided the Pangeng 盤庚 chapters into three parts (as we still read it today), making it into a 31-chapter Shangshu.
____	
The next central figure for the history of the Shangshu is that of Du Lin 杜林 (first CE), who made a lacquer edition of the Shangshu in 29 chapters. Because this edition was written in ancient script, it became known as Guwen Sangshu 古文尚書. This led to the mistaken assumption that his edition included the 16 guwen chapters found in the first century BCE. These 29 chapter Shangshu eventually reached Mei Ze 梅賾 (fl. Beginning fourth century CE), the Easter Jin 東晉 dynasty scholar who is responsible for the shape of the Shangshu in 58 chapters that we see today. After reorganizing the 29 chapters into 33, he fabricated (wei 偽) the remaining chapters on the basis of older material and quotations in other texts. In fact, there is no evidence a single person was responsible for all the fabricated chapters. However, it is plausible that he was the one who eventually presented this 58 chapter Shangshu to the Jin court. While Song 宋 scholars raised some eyebrows about language used in the chapters that Mei Ze composed, the Shangshu remained by and large unquestioned, until Yan Ruoqu 閻若璩 (1636–1704) and Hui Dong 惠棟 (1697–1758) identified the chapters added by Mei Ze as fabrications, showing their inconsistencies and linguistic mistakes.

A new chapter in the history of the Shangshu is being now written, following the recovery of bamboo manuscripts, in particular those now part of the Tsinghua University 清華大學 collection. Among these manuscripts, several bear titles similar to titles of Shangshu chapters that were listed as lost during the Han Dynasty, such as the Fu Yue zhi ming 傅說之命; others are written in what is now called shu 書 style (Allan 2012), such as the Feng xu zhi ming 封許之命, the Zhi zheng zhi dao 治政之道, and the Si gao 四吿. As with many of the recently recovered manuscripts, scholars lively debate on the nature of these manuscripts. The initial publication (Qinghua daxue cang Zhanguo zhu jian 清華大學藏戰國竹簡) identified many of these manuscripts as the de facto lost chapters of the Shangshu, including those not mentioned by Han texts. More recent scholarship has started to propose different interpretations on the nature of these manuscripts: while some resemble polished texts that might as well be originally part of the Shangshu, some manuscripts present mistakes and incongruities that suggest they might have been used as master copies or templates (most recently, Cheng Hao 2020; Jia Lianxiang 2020).

1063,"Lunyu 論語, The Analects",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Lunyu 論語, generally translated as The Analects, is a collection of sayings by or attributed to Confucius 孔子 (traditional dates 551–479 BCE), a ritual master who lived during the Eastern Zhou 東周 dynasty (770–221 BCE). These dialogues, often very brief and generic, were understood as indications on how to conduct oneself properly in society. A significant change that emerges from the Lunyu is the use of junzi 君子 (literally meaning “son of a lord”) to indicate a person who acts morally, regardless of birth (Goldin 2020: 49). This is tied to what seems a guiding principle in the Lunyu, in spite of its lack of a sustained argument. Many of the sayings attempt to establish a moral system that takes humans as yardstick, and leaves the veneration of spirits on the side. Some of the central virtues are humanity (ren 仁), morality (yi 義), and reciprocity (shu 恕). Yet, Confucius avoids giving any hard definition for any of these (Goldin 2020: 39, 41), for reasons unknown. Precisely because of the generic nature of these statements, a plethora of commentaries and interpretations has been and continues to be produced. 
___
Confucius’ influence on the contemporaneous and following generations is attested primarily in two ways: one, his views are object of debate among other intellectuals. Most famously, Mozi 墨子 criticized ideas attributed to Confucius, while Mengzi 孟子 and Xunzi 荀子 included them in their own philosophical systems. Secondly, his sayings circulated across time and space, as archeological recoveries indicate: sections of the Lunyu dating to first century BCE have been recovered in modern North Korea at Pyongyang, in Dingzhou, China (both discussed in van Els 2018), and in what constituted the north-west frontier of the Han empire (Sanft 2019). 
___
What we read today is based on a 17th century edition by Jin Pan 金蟠, based on the Lu 魯 Lunyu, one of the three major editions of this text mentioned by the Treatise on Arts and Letters 藝文志, the oldest extant bibliography included in the Book of Han 漢書. The other two versions are the Qi 齊 Lunyu, and the gu Lunyu 古論語, so named because it was written in ancient script, guwen 古文. According to the Shiji 史記, the guwen Lunyu was recovered in the wall of the once house of Confucius, when Prince Liu Yu 劉餘 (d. 127 BCE) demolished parts of it to expand it during the second century BCE. The Treatise further lists nine more textual lineages (jia 家) for this text, which are named after the scholars who taught them. It remains unclear if the differences rested in the content or the interpretations of these scholars. With the starting of the Han dynasty, the Qi and Lu Lunyu continued to circulate while others stopped being mentioned. 
___
Although it was elevated to a classic only during the Tang 唐 dynasty (618–907), the Lunyu was already influential during the Han 漢 dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). While of the Pyongyang Lunyu only a cursory study has been made available to scholars, studies on the Dingzhou Lunyu suggest that still by 50 BCE, the Lunyu was not a closed collection yet. 
____
As of 2023, three manuscript discoveries that will cast more light on the textual history of the Analects have been announced. One is the scientifically excavated material from the tomb of the Marquis of Hai Hun 海昏後. This was the title taken by Liu He 劉賀 (?–59BCE) after being deposed in 74 BCE. Initial publications on the Hai Hun texts describe 500 very poorly preserved strips of Lunyu material, including the chapter Zhi dao 知道. The Zhi dao is one of the two chapters (the other being the Wen wang 問王) that, according to Ban Gu 班固, characterized Qi Lunyu. However, the manuscript does not include the Wen wang, hence editors are reluctant to identify it as an exemplar of the Qi tradition. Furthermore, given the presence of other otherwise unattested chapters, they speculate on whether this may be a personal selection of chapters made by Liu He or his teacher. In support of this idea, the editors indicate that the material features of this manuscript suggest that the chapters were circulating independently, and that there is no reference to it as the Lunyu (the editors use the expression “Hai Hunhou Lunyu” as a matter of convenience, Zhu Fenghan 朱鳳瀚 2020). What this exactly entails for the textual history of the Lunyu remains open to debate, one that must await the publication of the Hai Hunhou corpus.
___
The two other manuscripts are more revealing, because they date to the Warring States 戰國時代 (375–221BCE) era. They predate the moment of textual formation during the Western Han dynasty. One manuscript has been titled by the editors ""Zhongni said"" 仲尼曰. It is part of a group of looted manuscripts, purchased by the Anhui University in 2015. The second manuscript, “*Kongzi said” 孔子曰 is from the Wangjiazui 王家嘴 corpus, archaeologically excavated starting in 2019. Preliminary information published (see references below). As with the Anhui University manuscript, “*Kongzi said” 孔子曰 is a list of sayings attributed to Confucius. Some were known in the existing literature, others are otherwise unattested. While the Anda manuscript has been published in its entirely, the Wangjiazui one is still being curated.",-500,1911,809,586,Maddalena Poli,2021-03-15 08:48:04.823 +0100,2023-12-22 19:35:35.629 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1065,Ancient Egypt- Tomb of Nefertari,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Tomb of Nefertari: New Kingdom, 19th Dynasty (c. 1295-1250 BCE); This tomb was created for Nefertari, the chief wife of Ramses II. The tomb is located in the so-called Valley of the Queens, a series of wadis, or ravines, in the western Theban valley.  This necropolis, as opposed to its more famous counterpart, the Valley of the Kings, served to house the remains of queens, royal children, and other royal family members of the New Kingdom period. Both of these necropoleis were restricted for use by the royal family, and would have house the mummified remains of the individual and an assortment of funerary goods, like coffin(s), sarcophagi, furniture, food-stuffs, personal adornments, etc.

Nefertari's tomb (QV 66) is best known for the high-degree of preservation of the tomb's paintings which reflect the various afterlife beliefs. The reliefs depict Nefertari in a variety of cultic roles before many deities, like Atum, Osiris, and Anubis. A selection of texts from the Book of the Dead appear on the walls as well. These texts were necessary to aid and protect Nefertari's person to and in the afterlife.

The tomb consists of seven chambers, led to by a main set of stairs, in a roughly straight axis. The tombs of the Queen's Valley would have been constructed by the artisans from Deir el-Medina, who also were involved in the construction of the tombs of the King's Valley. 

The tomb was re-discovered by Ernesto Schiaparelli in 1904, with recent conservation work done by the Getty in the 1990's. Most recently, the tomb was reopened to the restricted viewing to the public.",-1250,-1250,1205,838,Jordan Galczynski,2021-03-16 19:18:16.602 +0100,2021-08-09 00:07:38.278 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1067,"*Xing zi ming chu 性自命出, Natural Dispositions Come from Endowment",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Xing zi ming chu 性自命出, or Natural Dispositions come from Endowment, is a most-debated bamboo manuscript from the Guodian 郭店 corpus, named after the village where the tomb that contained this material was located (modern Hubei, China). The tomb was scientifically excavated in 1993 after being looted, and is dated to the beginning of the third century BCE. The corpus includes manuscripts of the Laozi 老子 (or Dao de jing 道德經), the Ziyi 緇衣 (now a chapter in the Liji 禮記), and other previously unattested texts. All these manuscripts are written in Chu 楚 script and predate the standardization of the script that took place during the Qin 秦 dynasty (221–202 BCE), thus constituting vital evidence for the study of Old Chinese language (scripts and reconstructions). 
_____
After the publication of the Guodian corpus in 1998, Xing zi ming chu immediately attracted worldwide scholarly attention for its content. According to this manuscript, xing 性 (generally translated as ""human nature"") can be described as a set of natural dispositions shared by all members of the same species. Xing zi ming chu further details the origin of qing 情 (“emotions”), and how human nature and emotions respond to forms of stimulation such as music (le 樂), rituals (li 禮), and externalities (wu 物). These were all subjects of animated debates during the Warring States era (475–221 BCE); there are in fact several intertextual parallels that can be highlighted between Xing zi ming chu and other texts related to the period. Differently from other discussions of human nature that emerged during the Warring States, Xing zi ming chu is not a treatise with one or more arguments. Rather, it collects statements concerning the topics just listed, with several echoes of other discussions of human nature now part of the body of transmitted literature (such as Mengzi 孟子, Xunzi 荀子, Zhuangzi 莊子, Lushi chunqiu 呂氏春秋).
_____
A second wave of enthusiasm for this text took place shortly after 2001, when a group of bamboo manuscripts that appeared on the Hong Kong market in 1994 and were purchased by the Shanghai Museum began to be published. Among these, a manuscript titled by the editors Xing qing lun 性情論 (Discussions on Natural Dispositions and Emotions) parallels some of the content of Xing zi ming chu. The texts have been generally ascribed as close to the Confucian or Ru 儒 tradition, although uncertainties remain concerning their exact positions within intellectual lineages, if any. 
_____
The manuscripts has been addressed variously: as one coherent unit, as two texts (pian 篇) addressing the same topics, or explored in sections, especially those that resonate most with texts from the body of transmitted literature. In spite of almost twenty years of scholarship on it and the recovery of the Xing qing lun, there are many residual uncertainties about this text, in particular the interpretation of graphs. This poses many questions concerning the nature of this manuscript, who produced it and for what purpose. Unfortunately, being the tomb looted before archeologists could get to it, much of its material artifacts that may have provided useful information was taken. Motivations behind the burial of texts in tombs also remain subject to debate. While the impressive amount of manuscripts from the Warring States period being recovered moved the conversations onto these new collections, the Guodian corpus remains a principal body of material for the understanding of manuscript culture in ancient China, one to which scholars will return to continuously.",-400,-200,809,586,Maddalena Poli,2021-03-17 10:42:14.324 +0100,2022-02-10 03:22:05.533 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1068,"Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, Henan Province of P. R. China",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This entry seeks to provide notes, text and image archives, discuss scholarly debates, and link relevant resources surrounding the Longmen Grottoes, a major Chinese Buddhist historical and UNESCO World Heritage site in Luoyang, Henan Province, from antiquity to the present. 
Meaning “dragon gate,” the name Longmen refers to the scenic mountain ravine between the East (303.5 meters altitude) and West Hills (Longmenshan, 263.9 meters altitude) through which the Yi River flows, a place also known as Yique, about thirteen13 kilometers (around 8 miles, or 25 li) south of Luoyang in Henan Province, the central province of the North China Plain, the heartland and imperial capital of thirteen Chinese dynasties, mostly south of the Yellow River. Approximately and arguably dating from 493 CE during the Northern Wei Dynasty (386–534) as a Buddhist votive site, the Longmen Grottoes as we see today comprise an assemblage of more than 2,000 stone niches and caves, over 100,000 fine-grained limestone sculptures and reliefs, and around 2,800 memorial steles (stone tablets) containing more than 300,000 words of inscribed text. The caves are carved into a 1-kilometer stretch of limestone cliffs on either side of the Yi River. While many of Longmen’s sculptures are low relief carvings on the walls and ceilings of the caves, some are spectacularly hewn out of the limestone in situ. The inscriptions are also mostly chiseled into walls and ceilings, alongside the images to which they refer. 

The production of stone images at Longmen continued in the Eastern Wei (534–550), Western Wei (535–556), Northern Qi (550–577), Northern Zhou (557–581), and Sui (581–618) dynasties, tailing off after the Tang dynasty (618–907) as Luoyang was repeatedly subject to war and communal violence and gradually waned in status, although new carving projects were likely undertaken until the early seventeenth century during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Slighted and denounced as a squandering of resources on gaudy frippery for centuries by many Chinese elites in history, the large group of stone icons, decorated cave chapels, votive niches, walls, ceilings, inscribed steles, pillars, and floors at Longmen received irregular maintenance and repair, probably the most significant due to the Qianlong emperor’s visit in 1750.

Rediscovered by American, British, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Swedish scholars, collectors and connoisseurs around the turn of the twentieth century, Longmen in modern times came to embody the values of universalism, modernity, and the modern impulse for both China and the world. The treasures at Longmen—preeminently stone sculptures dating from the fifth to the tenth centuries CE—were the object of a global quest that can be compared with the exploits of Indiana Jones. In 2001, UNESCO decided to add the Longmen Grottoes to the World Heritage List of properties deemed to have outstanding universal value.",1,2021,1316,917,Dong Wang,2021-03-18 22:23:47.058 +0100,2022-01-25 22:16:05.298 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1070,The Sanctuary of the Egyptian Gods in Marathon,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"To the south of the Marathon plain, in the little marsh known as Mikro Elos or Brexiza, between the Agrieliki mountain and the sea, and at the borders between the modern villages of Marathon and Nea Makri, lies the so-called Sanctuary of the Egyptian Gods. The sanctuary has the form of a precinct and consists of two connected courtyards built in a marshy area with manmade canals. The main court consists of the temple enclosed by an almost quadrilateral peribolos. In the middle of each side, oriented to the four cardinal points, there is an entrance in the form of an Egyptian pylon. Each doorway is framed by four statues – two male and two female – on high bases. The four statues that decorated each entrance pylon, two internally and two externally, represent Isis and Osiris. This combination of male and female creates an arrangement that emphasizes the Egyptian origins of the cult, reminiscent of the reliefs in the pylons of the Egyptian temples. These entrances lead through a paved walkway to the central construction of the sanctuary, a terrace with a cryptoporticus and an upper structure probably in the shape of a pyramid, perhaps alluding to the formation of an Egyptian landscape. Herodes Atticus was the man that commissioned the building of the sanctuary in the mid-second century CE and, according to Philostratus, facilitated his teaching and philosophical activities in the area. The sanctuary preserves representations of Isis, Osiris, Horus as a falcon, sphinxes but also busts of the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius. In addition, the presence of large ritual lamps attests to processions and rituals in order to honor the deities.",150,200,1209,895,Dafni MaikidouPoutrino,2021-03-20 15:52:58.319 +0100,2021-08-24 02:07:14.976 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1071,Digital Shinto Communities,43,Religious Group (v6),"Digital Shinto communities (DSCs) are transnational networks of Shinto shrines, priests, and lay practitioners supported by various forms of digital technology, in particular social media platforms. These communities center on the ritual veneration of immanent Shinto deities known as kami (神), as ""Shintō"" (神道) is often translated as ""the Way of the Kami."" The category of kami is quite broad, including: divine personalities such Amaterasu Omikami,  sun goddess and imperial ancestress, or Inari Okami, particularly revered for agriculture, business, and prosperity broadly conceived; impersonal natural forces or features such as wind, thunder, trees, rivers, and mountains; and human figures. Generally speaking, during Shinto ritual veneration, extensions of a kami's spirit may be called to reside in certain natural and man-made materials (such as a sacred evergreen branch, a mirror, sword, paper or wooden talisman, etc.) to receive offerings and prayers.

The emergence of digital Shinto communities can be traced back to the advent of Web 2.0 with the creation of the Shinto Mailing List (ShintoML) on Yahoo! Groups in 2000. ShintoML was extremely active for a decade and enjoyed a membership of over one thousand people, though activity began to taper off in 2010 as ShintoML members migrated to Facebook following the platform’s upgrading of group features. Today, as many as ten thousand people are members of an active Facebook DSC, though community engagement spans multiple social media platforms including blogs, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and Patreon. Some DSCs are public general Shinto interest groups, while others are private organizations for shrine supporters (sūkeisha 崇敬者) and confraternity (kō 講) members.

While DSC membership includes Japanese emigrants and their descendants (nikkeijin 日系人), the majority of members tend to be non-Japanese with general knowledge of Japanese history and culture gleaned from popular Japanese media, the internet, and brief trips to Japan. However, the most active members have extensive knowledge of Shinto gained through personal study, several years of membership in DSCs, and ritual practice. A 2019 survey of fifty DSC members and kamidana 神棚 (domestic altar) ownership indicates that the majority live in the United States and the UK, although membership truly spans the globe. Most were raised in nominally Christian households, though others grew up in atheist and Buddhist families. Official group leadership, on the other hand, is populated by a mix of Japanese, Nikkei, and Caucasian administrators (“admins”) or moderators (“mods”) with varying levels of institutional involvement, ranging from lay shrine caretaker to senior priest. DSC members share most beliefs and practices in common, though they may support different shrines and venerate different kami, the divinities at the center of Shinto ritual.

Often without direct access to traditional Shinto spaces and materials such as shrines or sacred talismans (ofuda お札) required for ritual practice in one’s home, compounded by a distinct lack of foundational Shinto texts (particularly translated into English) to which they may refer, transnational Shinto practitioners must make creative use of the sources available to them to establish shared knowledge, aesthetics, belief, and practice and properly manage their veneration of kami. These strategies include creating in-group informational resources relating to core Shinto beliefs, texts, and practices such as guidelines and FAQs (“frequently asked questions”), reviewing academic and popular publications on Shinto, sharing photographs of ritual materials and links to trusted vendors, and participating in in-person rituals and ritual livestreams.

Though often overlooked, digital Shinto communities hold significant relevance for the study of Japanese religion, online or digital religion, and globalization. Issues of authority and authenticity are raised as DSC members seek, construct, and contest the legitimization of personal approaches to Shinto within a polyvocal network of shrines from various traditions within Shinto, academic and popular literature, online forums, blogs, and popular media. Moreover, Shinto ontologies of the sacred are reconfigured as DSC members theorize and manage their relationships with kami, their local environment, and everyday experiences.",2001,2021,1435,879,Kaitlyn Ugoretz,2021-03-20 19:06:44.476 +0100,2022-11-08 23:42:02.291 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1072,Ancient Egypt - The Temple of Mentuhotep II,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The temple of king Mentuhotep II (ca. 2055-2004 BCE) is located in the valley of Deir el-Bahari on the West Bank of the river Nile, opposite the modern-day city of Luxor. The ancient Egyptian term that was often used to indicate this monument was 3ḫ-swt-nb-ḥpt-Rˁ (efficient/glorious are the places of Nebhepetre). The temple functioned as the cult place where the deceased king would have been provided with offerings for the afterlife. At the same time, it also functioned as a place of worship for the god Amun, whose cult statue stood in the sanctuary of the temple. It has been argued that there must have been an important connection between this temple and the temple of Amun at Karnak, because Mentuhotep II might have been the instigator of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley. This festival, during which the cult statue of Amun of Karnak travelled in procession to the temple of Mentuhotep II, maintained its popularity until the Greco-Roman period almost 2000 years later.

Mentuhotep II is considered to have been the first king of a reunited Egypt after a period of political division (also called the First Intermediate Period). Therefore, his reign is considered as the start of what we now call the period of the Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 BCE).",-2055,-2004,1211,914,Maarten Praet,2021-03-20 19:28:55.418 +0100,2021-06-02 22:29:56.803 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The word “Chu” designates the watery southern region of present-day China along the Yangzi River, at one point an independent kingdom before its conquest in 223 BCE by the expanding Qin empire (221–206 BCE). The founders of the subsequent Han empires (202 BCE–220 CE) hailed from the Chu region. As one of the two oldest extant collections of Chinese verses, the /Chuci/ is traditionally conceived of as the younger, southern, and “romantic” counterpart to the /The Classic of Poetry/ (Shijing 詩經), the older, northern, and canonical anthology associated with the culture of the Zhou polity (ca.1046–256 BCE). The term “Chuci” can be used to designate both this anthology and the Chuci genre or style (also known as the /sao/ 騷). Poems written in the Chuci or /sao/ style employ a distinctive meter and a specialized repertoire of vocabularies and formulae, in addition to references to the landscape and mythology of the south. They also tend to be fantastical and elegiac in content and tone. || 

Wang Yi ascribes the first seven titles (in the received 12th-century /Chuci buzhu/ 楚辭補注 edition), roughly the earliest layer of this compilation, to the archetypical poet of the Chuci genre, Qu Yuan 屈原 (trad. 343–290 BCE). An upright minister of Chu, Qu Yuan is said to have been exiled on account of slander and wrote a body of verses during his banishment, before drowning himself in the Miluo 汨羅 river. The most well-known among these verses is the first piece of the compilation, “Li sao” 離騷 (Encountering Sorrow). Except for the final piece associated with Wang Yi, the remaining titles are attributed either to Qu Yuan’s purported disciples or to literary figures of the Western Han (202 BCE–7 CE). The earliest historical event known to be associated with this text took place in 139 BCE, when Liu An 劉安 (179?–112 BCE), the King of Huainan, paid a visit to his nephew, Emperor Wu of Han (r.141-87 BCE), and is said to have presented Chuci materials to the young emperor (/Hanshu/ 44.2145). Wang Yi claims as the basis of his commentary in /Chuci zhangju/ earlier exegetical writings, which include a work attributed to Liu An. || 

Prior to its introduction to the Han imperial court, verses composed in the Chuci genre might have been employed in ritual and performative settings, although the extant poems in /Chuci zhangju/ are best understood as literary rewritings that indirectly preserve traces of the earlier ritual contexts. Each piece within the poetic suite “Nine Songs” (Jiu ge 九歌), for instance, addresses a god or a type of spirit in a pantheon of deities, most of whom are associated with nature. Two of the three “Summons” (/zhao/ 招) pieces, such as  “Summoning the Soul” (Zhao hun 招魂), call upon deceased spirits, and might have evolved from funerary chants. “Heavenly Questions” (Tianwen 天問) contains over 150 questions concerning cosmogony, cosmology, legendary and historical heroes, including the kings of the Chu state. “Far Roaming (Yuan you 遠遊) suggests a process of self-cultivation or even self-divinization. Some of the motifs and formulae appear to have religious significance, such as the failed quests for goddesses and heavenly processions encircling a mandala-like cosmos. || 

The formation process of the anthology /Chuci zhangju/ attests to the incorporation of this body of materials into Han elite literary culture. The composition of the written pieces in this anthology involves the reworking and re-interpretation of existing verses as the literary compositions of the scholar-official class, whose ethos is embodied by the archpoet Qu Yuan. Its later, imitative pieces, along with its exegetical writings, are centered around the political and moral concerns of the scholar-officials. Formulaic phrases that might have once been associated with ritual purification, for example, became metaphors for moral purity in the context of court politics. Since the Han, composing Chuci verses and imitating the /Chuci zhangju/ often functioned as a space of negotiation between political loyalty and dissent. || 

The /Chuci zhangju/ also has its legacy in popular culture. Folk worship of Qu Yuan during the Duanwu 端午 (Fifth Day of the Fifth Lunar Month) became one of the major yearly festivities in traditional and contemporary China. The commemoration of the drowned poet serves as the etiological explanation for customs such as the dragon boat race. || 

In existing scholarship, the Chuci corpus has often been understood through the lens of shamanism—translators from Arthur Waley to Gopal Sukhu have rendered the religious specialist “wu” 巫 as “shaman”—which is nevertheless a much-debated interpretative framework. Due to the near absence of direct evidence external to the text, reconstructions of the time, place, belief systems, and practices of its earlier religious contexts are at best educated guesses. This entry focuses on the formation process of the /Chuci zhangju/ as a literary anthology in the Han imperial and elite circle, between Liu An’s visit in 139 BCE and Wang Yi’s period of activities. It will nevertheless acknowledge the religious elements explicitly mentioned within the poems, such as its pantheon and cosmology.",-139,140,1272,878,Heng Du,2021-03-26 16:21:33.872 +0100,2021-09-28 01:35:33.278 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1075,Dazhidu lun 大智度論,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Sanskrit: Mahāprajñāpāramitā Upadeśa; Chinese: Dàzhìdù Lùn) is a bright jewel in the treasury of the world’s religious and philosophical literature.  Its monumental size, vast scope and rich content have already sealed its place in humanities spiritual legacy.  Composed by one of the most remarkable yet enigmatic figures of Buddhism, the legendary Nāgārjuna, this commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom Scripture builds on the ancient traditions of early Buddhism, adds scholastic systematic analysis, and rallies together the scriptures and treatises of Mahāyāna Buddhism, to champion the Madhyamaka “Middle Way” of the Bodhisattva’s spiritual path to the omniscience of a fully awakened Buddha.  It took the master translator Kumārajīva and his team of elite Chinese Buddhist scholars to do justice to such a work of genius, producing a translation that matched Nāgārjuna’s religious and philosophical content with a standard of literary excellence, which itself brought about a new zenith in classical Chinese Buddhist writing.  This translation, which is now our only source of the original text, was a veritable gold mine of Indian Buddhist legend and lore, thought and ideas, practice and theory, for subsequent generations of Chinese Buddhists.  As first a central column for the Three Treatise and Tiāntaí schools, it functioned as an important point of reference for the Pure Land and Chán schools, and also the Flower Adornment and Discipline schools, thus permeating the entirety of classical Chinese Buddhism.

1076,Inquisitors of Goa's Santo Ofício,43,Religious Group (v6),"Belonging to Catholic Religious Orders and sharing European origins, the men that occupied the rank of inquisitor formed a powerful political and religious group in the Estado da Índia through the  16th and 17th centuries. One of the most important courts of the Portuguese Empire, the Santo Ofício, in regard to Portuguese India, not only it had jurisdiction over Christians, but also over member of others beliefs who tried to oppose to the Catholic Portuguese presence and proselytism. Agents of great importance in such reality, the inquisitors were in the highest ranks of this court, giving their verdicts which included, if the culprit was considered guilty, the capital punishment.

1077,The Cherished Instruction (Baoxun 保訓),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Baoxun 保訓 (""The Cherished Instruction"") is an excavated text of eleven bamboo strips that is part of the collection of such texts purchased by Tsinghua in 2008. As with other such collections, their provenance is unknown. 

The text is notable because its content and self-identification as a xun 訓 ""instruction,"" associate it with the Shangshu 尚書 or ""Book of Documents"" (for more, see the entry on the Shangshu by Maddalena Poli). Despite the fact that xun is one of the six types of documents in the Shangshu, the Baoxun has no counterpart in the Shangshu or the received tradition more broadly. 

The Baoxun, thus, points to the idea that shu were not simply the documents of the Shangshu, but a genre of texts defined by their claimed contemporaneity. Shu originated as the pre-prepared scripts of speeches by kings and ministers that were read out during formal ceremonies and often presented to those they addressed. Later texts of the shu genre were fictional compositions written in imitation of those earlier records. Accordingly, they adopt the formal style of those speeches, employing phrases such as ""the king so said"" (wang ruo yue 王若曰) - a phrase also found on bronze vessel inscriptions from the Western Zhou period (1046-771 BCE). In doing so, shu texts claim to be contemporary to the events that they portray, irrespective of when they were actually written. 

In the case of the Baoxun, it was likely written during the Warring States period but it is set during the final days of the life of King Wen 文. It takes the form of an instruction left by King Wen to his son, King Wu 武, who would go on to conquer the Shang 商 dynasty (1600-1046 BCE) and establish the Zhou 周 dynasty (1046-771 BCE). In his instruction, King Wen presents the sage-king Shun 舜 and Shang Jia Wei 上甲微 (an ancestor of the Shang) as models and urges his son to hold fast to the ""center"" (zhong 中) in order to rule. 

The center is both actual - meaning Mount Song 嵩 in Henan 河南 province, traditionally considered the center of All under Heaven - and cosmological and to rule with the celestial mandate of the high god entailed possessing the center in both a literal and figurative sense. This emphasis on the center would have been more relevant to the Warring States than the Zhou dynasty because during the former period there was no longer a central authority and so the concern was with establishing a central power rather than overthrowing an existing one.",-325,-278,1214,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-03-30 19:40:23.124 +0200,2023-06-26 22:06:04.513 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1078,Hymns to the Aten,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Aten was the pharaonic Egyptian name for and concept of the sun disk, visible and tangible, but also a supernatural power. The ""hymns to the Aten"" are hieroglyphic texts written on the walls of the monumental private rock-cut tombs of Akhetaton (today called ""Amarna""), a place located in Middle Egypt, which has been the capital (at least cultic capital and home of the court, while Memphis might still have been the economic capital) during the reign of Akhenaten (ca. 1352-1336 B.C.E.). The so-called ""Amarna period"" is generally conceptualized as a time of monotheism, but could rather be seen as a time of henotheism or monolatry. Akhenaten built Akhetaten as a place to worship the Aten exclusively.
The language of the texts is Middle Egyptian with elements of Late Egyptian.
The most extensive version of the ""hymns to the Aten"" is called the ""Great hymn to the Aten"" and is inscribed into the western/right thickness of the entrance of Tomb No. 25 (=TA 25), belonging to Ay and Tiy. The ""Short hymn to the Aten"" is inscribed into the thicknesses of the entrance doorways of five other tombs (Meryra I, TA 04; Tutu, TA 08; Mahu, TA 09; Apy, TA 10; Any, TA 23, ) and in one of these tombs (Mahu, TA 09) written on two stelae as well. The texts are always combined with depictions in relief of the tomb owners  in a position of adoration, sometimes depictions of the royal family are located above the text. The tomb owners held diverse titles, but only Ay (TT 25) and Meryra I (TT 04) held priestly titles (Ay was ""God’s Father"" and Meryra I was ""High Priest of the Aten in Akhetaten""). Panehesy, owner of TT 06, was ""Chief Servant of the Aten (in the House of the Aten in Akhetaten)"", but his tomb, as many others, contained texts which are generally not classified as ""hymns to the Aten"" by the field, but do express the adoration of the Aten (if only in the particular aspect of the setting or rising sun) as well. These other texts which were also inscribed into the thicknesses of the entrances are shorter (sometimes just very fragmentary, so that not much is left of them) and different in composition, so that they were not classified by the field as ""hymns to the Aten"". They do, however, express the same ideas and many words and phrases are indeed the same as those in the ""hymns"". 
This entry will answer the questions on the basis of all these texts from these tombs entrance thicknesses, which give praise to the Aten/sun, describe the qualities of the god and the relationships between the god and the people (see pdf ""hymns to the Aten""). The texts use the words ""dwA"" and ""jA.w"" to express the adoration and praise, they address and describe the rising (""wbn"") and setting (""Htp"") of the sun, the power of the sunbeams and their positive effects on all living beings, but also the times of night as times of sleeping like dead. 

The hymns to the Aten are private funerary texts, but inside and outside the field they are falsely understood as scripture of this period. The ""Great hymn to the Aten"" is often said to have been composed by the king himself, but there is no evidence for this assumption. It is also sometimes suggested, that this very hymn was meant to be spoken by the king, but there is more reason for the tomb owners to be meant as the speakers. 
Interestingly the king's tomb did not show any sign of a hymnic text; instead, there is a depiction of the sun disk atop mountains, ostriches or bustards, gazelles, and desert hares loping uphill. This motif can be seen as a non-textual rendering of a hymn to the Aten. It also makes sense, that the king's tomb did not give praise to the Aten the same way as the private tombs did. The royal tomb was meant to be closed for ever after the burial, while the private tombs were designed to be visited for cultic practice after the burial. Moreover, the private tomb owners' figures actually came into contact with the beams of the rising and setting sun in their location, being written on the thicknesses of the entrance doorways.",-1352,-1336,34,922,Janne ArpNeumann,2021-03-30 22:54:34.052 +0200,2022-06-02 06:59:51.141 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1079,Tongshu 通書,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Zhou Dunyi's Tongshu 通書 (Penetrating the Scripture of Change) is less well-known than the Taijitu shuo but is no less important for an understanding of Zhou Dunyi's thought. (For a brief account of Zhou Dunyi see the Entry Description of the Taijitu shuo.) The two works are very different in format: the Taijitu shuo is a single coherent essay, while the Tongshu as we have it today (in Zhu Xi's rescension) is composed of forty shorter, aphoristic, mostly independent pieces, each one with a title added by Zhu Xi. Furthermore, the central idea of each -- taiji 太極 (Supreme Polarity) in the Taijitu shuo and cheng 誠 (being authentic) in the Tongshu -- is not found at all in the other. Nevertheless, there are several important overlaps and no significant inconsistencies between the two texts, and I agree with Zhu Xi that they are products of the same author. ""Penetrating the Scripture of Change"" is a loose translation of the title, which more literally means ""penetrating writing"" or ""penetrating the book."" Zhu Xi averred that the original title was ""Yi tongshu"" 易通書, or ""Book Penetrating the Yi,"" and most scholars have accepted that, as the text does refer to and quote the Yijing 易經 frequently. In fact it contains brief commentaries on nine of the sixty-four hexagrams of the Yi.
	While the Taijitu shuo is a philosophic cosmogony, situating human beings and in particular sages in the metaphysical and cosmological natural order, the Tongshu focuses in more detail on sagehood. Relying on both the Yijing and the Zhongyong 中庸 (Centrality and Commonality), it defines sagehood as ""being authentic"" (cheng). This term, usually but inadequately translated as ""sincerity,"" has both a psychological and metaphysical meaning. On the simplest level it means having consistency between one's inner state and outward behavior. On this level ""sincerity"" is a somewhat superficial but adequate translation. However, even in the Zhongyong it is clear that cheng has a deeper meaning than ""sincerity,"" and for this reason I translate it as ""being authentic,"" in the sense of being real or genuine (shi 實), true to one's innate moral nature (xing 性) and fully embedded in the Way (dao 道), or fully aligned with li 理, the natural/moral order. Another major theme of the Tongshu is the importance of learning (xue 學) in the cultivation of sagehood, exemplified by Confucius' favorite disciple, Yan Hui 顏回.",1050,2021,1216,902,Joseph Adler,2021-04-02 03:32:20.881 +0200,2021-09-28 01:30:37.114 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1080,Cheng weishi lun 成唯識論,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Cheng weishi lun or the Demonstration of Nothing but Consciousness is a foundational treatise within East Asian Yogâcāra Buddhism. Completed in 660 C.E. by the polyglot scholar-monk, Xuanzang 玄奘 (602?-667 C.E.), a small coterie of prominent disciples, most notably Kuiji 窺基 (632-682 C.E.), and a team of scribes in an Imperially-sponsored ""translation bureau"" (Chi.: fanjing yuan翻經院) at the Yuhua Monastery 玉華寺 (a former palace converted into Xuanzang's monastic center by the Tang Emperor Gaozong高宗), located in the Yijun District宜君縣 of Fu Commandery鄜州 in Shaanxi Province 陝西, the Cheng weishi lun is an encyclopedic and systematic explication of the Indic sutras and treatises of Yogâcāra Buddhism.  The Cheng weishi lun follows the structure of the philosophical poem, Thirty Stanzas on Nothing but Consciousness (Skt.: Triṃśikā; Chi.: Weishi sanshi song唯識三十頌), written by the philosopher Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century C.E.). It includes the complete series of the Thirty Stanzas, commentaries on the stanzas written by several Indic Yogâcāra masters, and passages from Yogâcāra sūtras and treatises including the Laṅkāvatārasūtra, Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra, and Yogācārabhūmiśāstra. The ten “fascicle” (Chi.: juan卷) compilation of the Cheng weishi lun stands as one of the most complete and coherent expositions of Yogācāra doctrine and practice in the Buddhist literature. 


The presence of material of unique Sinitic origin suggests that, in addition to being an important record of the Yogâcāra treatises of Vasubandhu and other important Indic philosophers, the Cheng weishi lun contains original doctrinal and philosophical material of Sinitic origin. Therefore, recent scholars have concluded that the Cheng weishi lun is not a direct Chinese translation of any one specific Indic treatise, but is instead an original work of Yogâcāra theory and praxis.

The Cheng weishi lun is an elaboration of the teachings of Vasubandhu and other Yogācāra masters on the nature of the “dharmas” (Chi.: fa法), the fundamental constituents of reality. Throughout the Cheng weishi lun, Xuanzang and his disciples analyze the nature and the function of the dharmas that  comprise the entirety of the mental and physical experience of sentient beings. They conclude that the dharmas that comprise the physical and mental reality experienced by sentient beings, are “not independent” (Chi.: buli不離) from the consciousness and reinforce Vasubandhu’s contention that all experiences of the phenomenal world are mental projections and therefore “nothing but consciousness” (Skt.: vijñaptimātratā; Chi.: weishi唯識).


In supporting Vasubandhu’s contention, Xuanzang and his cohort make three overarching arguments to bolster the tenet of consciousness as the only reality. They state that: 1) the physical things that make up the sensory world, as well as the bodies and the sense organs of other sentient beings, are “cognitive objects” (Skt.: ālambana; Chi.: suoyuan所緣) that exist only in consciousness; 2) One’s own mind, and the minds of other sentient beings, are of the nature of consciousness; and 3) All mental and physical experiences exist only in eight layers of consciousness. Using these arguments, Xuanzang and his disciples conclude that all mental experiences, and all experiences of physical reality, are transformations of the dharmas as they arise, abide, decay and cease.

The Cheng weishi lun has important implications for the praxis of East Asian Yogācāra Buddhism. Throughout the ninth and tenth fascicles, the treatise examines and builds upon the inherited Indic accounts of the methodical path of Yogic Practice in Five Stages. The Cheng weishi lun explains how, through five stages of practice, practitioners can clear away the “cognitive distortions” (Skt.: viparyāsa; Chi.: diandao顛倒) that take what is unreal to be real in order to deepen their understanding of the tenet of nothing but consciousness, and to realize the “the nature of thusness” (Chi.: zhenru xing真如性), or how reality truly is. 

The Cheng weishi lun is thus a primer for the essential doctrine and practices of East Asian Yogācāra Buddhism. The core tenet of nothing but consciousness, synthesized and fortified in the Cheng weishi lun deeply informs the doctrinal systems of Tiantai, Huayan, Chan, and esoteric Buddhism. Furthermore, the five stages inform the models of the Buddhist path (Skt.: mārga; Chi.: dao道) found in these other traditions of Chinese Buddhism. 

These traditions of Chinese Buddhism have adapted the Yogācāra tenet of nothing but consciousness to buttress the doctrinal position of “nothing but mind” (Skt.: cittamātra; Chi.: weixin唯心) which maintains that all dharmas are essentially mental projections. The paradigm of eight layers of consciousness laid out in the Cheng weishi lun also undergirds the doctrinal models of the mind found in these other traditions. While some authors in these traditions postulate an additional ninth or a tenth layer of consciousness, even within these other taxonomies, the basic understanding of the nature and function of the prior eight layers of consciousness, derived from the Yogācāra Buddhist teaching established in the Cheng weishi lun, remains a common denominator.",659,660,1426,923,Ernest Brewster,2021-04-03 19:21:56.361 +0200,2022-01-25 22:19:35.400 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1081,The Abydos Temple of Khentiamentiu,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Old Kingdom temple at Abydos was dedicated to the god Khentiamentiu, ""foremost of the westerners,"" a deity primarily depicted with a jackal head and intrinsically tied with the Abydene necropolis. Any archaeological remains of the Old Kingdom temple have yet to be excavated as they lie under the later period temple site and part of the modern town. 

Material excavated in the temple precinct, however, suggests significant royal involvement at the site. Seals discovered by Petrie dating to the Fifth Dynasty include the names of Userkaf, Sahure, Niuserre, and Neferirkare, while two stelae, one dating to the Fifth Dynasty reign of Neferirkare (MFA 03.1896) and one to the Sixth Dynasty reign of Teti (BM EA626), forbade interference with the priests and temple income. Excavations in the temple precinct have also uncovered four, small, mudbrick structures which have been identified by David O’Connor as ka-chapels of some Sixth Dynasty kings based on inscriptions, location, architecture, and comparanda from Bubastis and Hierakonpolis. One of these structures, labeled by Barry Kemp as structure H, was originally identified as the temple of Khentiamentiu proper and used to argue for the existence of ""pre-formal"" temples at Old Kingdom ""provincial"" sites, however, this hypothesis is no longer supported. Structure H instead appears to have been the ka-chapel of Pepi II based on an endowment found on the site. The other three structures do not have securely identified owners, however, textual evidence found at Abydos suggests that ka-chapels of Menrenre and Pepi I were also active in the Old Kingdom.

At some point between the late Old Kingdom and the Middle Kingdom,  the increasing importance of Osiris resulted in the synchronization of Khentiamentiu with this state god, creating Osiris-Khentiamentiu, “Lord of Abydos.” As a result, the temple precinct became associated, from this point forward, with Osiris.",-2750,-2150,1218,921,Emily SmithSangster,2021-04-04 03:05:54.232 +0200,2021-06-01 18:42:26.670 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It was constructed under king Arnakhamani (c. 235–218 BC) and is one of the most important religious monuments of the Early Meroitic period, testifying to seminal changes in Kushite religion in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. In the previous Napatan period (c. 650–300 BC), the Kushite pantheon – at least as represented in monumental sources – is exclusively composed of gods with an origin in Pharaonic Egypt, such as Amun. Non-Egyptian indigenous deities only appear in the subsequent Meroitic period (c. 300 BC–350 AD).

1083,Drukpa Kagyü School (Bhutan),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Drukpa Kagyü school belongs to the Kagyü school of Tibetan Buddhism. Standard Tibetan religious historiographies divide the Kagyü school into four main lineages: (1) the Phagdru Kagyü school with eight minor lineages founded by students of Phagmodrupa Dorje Gyelpo (1110–70), (2) the Karma Kagyü school, (3) the Barom Kagyü school, and (4) the Tshelpa Kagyü school. The Drukpa Kagyü school is counted among the minor lineages of (1) the Phagdru Kagyü school. However, the Drukpa Kagyü school is also heterogeneous with different sub-branches, such as the Bhutanese branch (lho ‘brug) with which this entry deals. 
In detail, the Drukpa Kagyü school goes back to the Buddhist master Tsangpa Gyaré Yeshe Dorje (1161–1211). In its beginnings, this school was associated with a strong emphasis on meditation and the simple lifestyle of mendicants. The Drukpa Kagyü school further split into three sub-branches, each established by another disciple of Tsangpa Gyaré Yeshe Dorje: (1) the middle Drukpa, (2) the upper Drukpa, and (3) the lower Drukpa. In fact, in reality, interactions between the sub-branches of the Drukpa Kagyü schools have been much more complex. 
Before the seventeenth century, Buddhist masters of all three sub-branches of the Drukpa Kagyü school were active and established religious institutions in Bhutan, such as Phajo Drukgom Zhikpo (1184–1251) or the famous “Madman of the Drukpa,” Drukpa Künlé (1455–1529). The Bhutanese branch of the Drukpa Kagyü school (Tib. lho ’brug) was newly established after the seventeenth century resulting from an additional split of the middle Drukpa Kagyü school into a “Northern,” i. e. Tibetan/Ladakhi, and “Southern,” i. e. Bhutanese branch. This split was caused by a dispute over Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594–ca. 1651) as the rightful incarnation of the earlier eminent lineage master, the 4th Drukchen Künkhyen Pema Karpo (1527-92). This subsequently led to Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel’s flight to Bhutan and the foundation of the State of Bhutan in 1625/26.

In Bhutan, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel successfully institutionalized a system of governance that united religious and political authority, the “Joint Twofold System of Governance” (Tib. srid chos gnyis ldan). Under him, a regent exercised political power while the “Chief Abbot of Bhutan” oversaw the religious institutions and was the head of the new Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyü school-starting with the 1st Chief Abbot Pekar Jungné (1604–72). This “Joint Twofold System of Governance” was renewed in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan from 2008. As of today, the 70th Chief Abbot Tulku Jigmé Chödra (b. 1955) is in office. In particular, regarding the Drukpa Kagyü school as a religious group, the relationship between the societal spheres of religion and politics is complex and very interesting. 
As in the other Kagyü schools, the central doctrine and meditative system in the Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyü school is Mahāmudrā (Tib. phyag rgya chen po). Other essential teachings are the “Six Yogas of Nāropa,” called in this school the teachings of “Merging and Transference” (Tib. bsre ’pho), and the “Six Cycles of Equal Taste” (Tib. ro snyoms skor drug). In particular, since the seventeenth century, important doctrinal and ritualistic innovations and new teaching cycles by their founder Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel were introduced. This entry covers the Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyü school (Tib. lho ‘brug), but it does not include religious groups of the Drukpa Kagyü schools outside of Bhutan on a global scale, primarily associated with branches and monasteries of the Drukpa Kagyü school from Ladakh, Darjeeling, or Tibet.

1087,The Bogomils,43,Religious Group (v6),"A dualistic, Neo-Manichean sect founded in Bulgaria in the 10th c. Heavily influenced by the Paulicans, Bogomilism denied many of the basic tenets of Orthodox Christianity, including the Incarnation, the earthly miracles of Jesus, and the Old Testament in its entirety. Holding that the material world and all things of matter were the creation of Satan, the Bogomils were often at odds with ecclesiastical authorities in the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires and preached a creed of active civil disobedience. Most of our information about them comes from polemics written against them, including those by Kosmas the Priest, Anna Komnene, Germanos II, and Euthymios Zigabenos. Only one piece of Bogomil apocrypha survives, the Interrogatio Johannis, or the Liber Secretus. Originally founded by an unknown priest in the mid-10th c. who took the name ‘Bogomil,’ which, according to Kosmas means ‘beloved of God’ in old Slavonic, by the 12th c. the sect could claim followers throughout the Balkans, Asia Minor, and in Constantinople itself, including amongst the elite. A core of ascetic practitioners adhered to an abstinence from meat, sexual intercourse, and wine. Actively persecuted throughout their existence, they nonetheless found many converts, particularly in the Balkans. In the early 13th c. they had become the dominant religious group in Bosnia, where they became known as the Patarenes, prompting crusading action against them. They subsequently entered Northern Italy and went on to influence the Cathars/Albigenses and the Waldensians. In Constantinople and Bulgaria their decline began in the 13th c. but they were not finally eradicated until Ottoman control over the Balkans was solidified in the 15th c.",969,1400,1224,913,Ian Randall,2021-04-19 21:47:03.471 +0200,2022-01-25 00:27:49.770 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The large number of statues and inscriptions suggests that the sanctuary hosted the cult of the Isiac family but also other deities such as Aphrodite, Athena, Pan. All these artifacts are a result of many chronological phases. During its five centuries of use, buildings were constructed, and probably buildings were reused for a different purpose. The different forms of deities worshiped in the sanctuary bear evidence of a vivid cult that involved numerous people: locals, Egyptians, Roman negotiatores, etc. They also reflect a strong network of religious connectivity between Thessalonica and other sites in the Aegean such as Delos, but also between Thessalonica and inland sites, such as Stobi.",-210,300,1228,895,Dafni MaikidouPoutrino,2021-04-28 15:41:18.301 +0200,2021-04-28 18:32:39.400 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1094,The Temple Complex at Jebel Barkal,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Jebel Barkal is an isolated sandstone butte beside the Nile, 23 km downstream from the mouth of the 4th cataract, near Karima, Sudan (N 18° 32.081, E 31° 49.876).  In ancient times it was called variously “Pure Mountain” and “Throne of the Two Lands” and was the chief landmark of a city called Napata, which marked the southern limit of Egypt’s African empire during the New Kingdom.  Perhaps even from prehistoric times, this hill was believed by the ancient Nubians to be the residence of a supreme Creator god and progenitor of kingship.  When the Egyptians conquered this region (known as “Kush”) about 1500 BC, they identified the god of the mountain as a primeval form of their own state god Amun of Karnak, whose chief sanctuary at Thebes lay 1260 km downstream.  

For centuries, the Egyptians had considered their king to be the son of Amun, and the Nile inundation to be his gift to Egypt. Since the Nile flood emanated from the distant South, they thus imagined that somewhere deep inside Kush, at or near the mysterious Nile sources, Amun had a primordial alter-ego, who released the waters each year, just as he had at the beginning of time.  It was this same primeval Amun whom they also believed dispensed the “royal ka,” the divine essence of kingship granted by the god to each new king, believed to be his own son.  When the Egyptians occupied Kush, they accepted Jebel Barkal as the place where this god dwelt.

If one gazes upon the hill today, it is easy to see why it acquired such revered status. Standing all alone in a vast desert plain, it was the perfect archetype of the legendary “Primeval Mound,” on which Creation was thought to have taken place. It faces the Nile with a sheer cliff, and from one corner rises a towering pinnacle, 75 m high, which, to ancient eyes, looked like a gigantic statue – but one in which different forms appeared, depending on the angle from which it was seen:  a) a colossal standing king, wearing the crown of Upper Egypt, b) an erect phallus, suggestive of Amun’s first creative act, and c) a rearing cobra (“uraeus”), suggesting both the presence of a mother goddess in serpent form and the symbol of kingship itself. By projecting all these forms, the pinnacle personified the primeval Amun himself (“Kamutef”), who was both male and female, embodied his own father and mother, and was able to generate and regenerate himself as his own child: the first divine king from whose body all others were thought to descend. 

Although Jebel Barkal was infrequently visited by the pharaohs, its sanctuary became the largest in Nubia.  As a coronation complex, it was thought to be a place where the king entered the mountain and ritually merged with the body of the god, his “father,” absorbing the “royal ka” and thus becoming a god-king himself.  

With the decline of the New Kingdom, the pharaohs were forced to retreat from Kush, which effectively cut their link to Jebel Barkal and their “father,” the primeval Amun, and severed their access to the “royal ka.”  As Egypt's kings weakened in this way, a native Nubian dynasty emerged at Napata, claiming to be Amun’s new “sons,” the exclusive possessors of the “royal ka,” and thus the only legitimate kings of Egypt.  By about 720 BCE these southern kings, in league with the Egyptian Amun priesthood at Thebes, seized control of Egypt and their family became the country’s 25th Dynasty.  

After sixty years, the kings of Kush were expelled from Egypt by the invading Assyrians, but they returned to their homeland and established a kingdom in Sudan centered at Meroe that lasted another millennium.  Throughout most of that time Jebel Barkal remained the site of the chief cult center of their kingdom, where generations of their kings received their crowns from the god in the mountain and nearby which many built their pyramids.",-1500,300,1233,707,Caroline Arbuckle,2021-05-07 21:10:35.655 +0200,2021-05-14 18:49:57.876 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1095,Punjabi (West),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the people living in what is now the Punjab Province of Pakistan. Specifically, this entry focuses on the rural Punjabi village of Mohla, located in Gujrat District, between the time of 1947-1958. This time frame begins with the establishment of Pakistan in 1947 and ends prior to the substantial government changes of 1948. The principal ethnographic source for this society, Zekiye Suleyman Eglar (1960), selected Mohla because it was not greatly affected by the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, allowing for the study of traditional Punjabi culture. Most Punjabis are Muslim and follow Islam. However, religious beliefs and practices are not discussed in depth by the principal authority. Consequently, the present entry provides a general overview and is limited to the information that is available. Religious activities follow the Muslim calendar, which is tied to the cycle of the moon. Religious leaders include the village imam, whose role involves formalized rituals, and the pirs or spiritual leaders.

1098,Shuzi gua excavated material,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The so-called shuzi gua 數字卦 corpus is a large set of unearthed texts whose earliest examples, according to some scholars, should date back to the Longshan Culture (龍山文化, ca. 3000-1900 BCE), while the more recent belong to the late Warring States period (戰國時期, 475-221 BCE) or even to the early Han (漢, 206 BCE-220). The term shuzi gua (‘numerical divinatory symbol’, or ‘numerical gua’) refers to a sequence of specific numbers, including ‘1’, ‘4’, ‘5’, ‘6’, ‘7’, ‘8’, and ‘9’; their distribution varies synchronically and diachronically, with ‘1’, ‘6’, ‘7’, and ‘8’ being consistently the more frequent to appear. Different combinations of such numbers are aligned one on top of the other—creating a sort of tower-like symbol—in groups of three, four, six, or pair of six; examples of shuzi gua comprising more than six numbers are extremely rare. Roughly one hundred instances of these symbols have been found on various types of unearthed artifacts, including oracle bones (ox scapula and turtle shells), bronze vessels, ordinary objects like whetstone or pottery handles, as well as bamboo manuscripts. Depending on the material carrier in which they are embedded, the shuzi gua are written in many different directions or even upside down, resulting in a diverse structural and visual mise-en-page.
Due to the presence of numbers and the sparsely appended divinatory inscriptions, these symbols are usually regarded by scholars, albeit to different degrees, as ancestors to the cleromantic practice related to the Zhouyi 周易 (Zhou Changes, also known as the Yijing 易經, Book of Changes) and to milfoil divination. The Zhouyi, or simply the Yi 易 (Changes), is a divination manual which has been canonised in 136 BCE, becoming the first among the so-called Confucian classics. Its basic constituent are the 64 Hexagrams, i.e. six-line diagrams which are supposed to owe their symbolic origin to the ancient Chinese cosmic concept of the Two Primary Forces: yin 陰 (the yielding, the dark, the feminine, represented by even numbers and the ‘broken line’  ), and yang 陽 (the rigid, the light, the masculine, represented by odd numbers and the ‘unbroken line’  ). The first scholar who systematically linked the shuzi gua to the Zhouyi was Zhang Zhenglang 張政烺 (1912–2005). In his article, published in 1980, he applied the odd/yang-even/yin dyadic interpretive scheme to convert each shuzi gua to the hexagrams of the Yi tradition. Prior to Zhang Zhenglang ground-breaking contribution, many scholars have long debated over the nature of what was then called “qizi 奇字” (strange graphs), without reaching a consensus. 
In the last decades, thanks to the acquisition of an increasing number of excavated texts, the literature on shuzi gua has thrived, and the hypothesis of a direct connection between these symbols and the Yi tradition has been questioned on several occasions (Xing Wen 邢文 2003; Li Zongkun 李宗焜 2006; Wu Yong 吴勇 2006; Wang Huaping 王化平 & Zhou Yan 周燕2015). The situation changed with the publication in 2013 of the bamboo manuscript titled by the editors Shifa 筮法 (Method of Milfoil Divination; ca. fourth century BCE). The importance of this manuscript mainly lies in the fact that it provides the earliest evidence of the application of the odd/even dyadic scheme to the numerical gua; therefore, it establishes a structural relationship between the late fourth century BCE divinatory practices and the Yi tradition (Cook & Breàrd 2019). Whether or not this scheme could be applied to the earlier materials is not clear as, unfortunately, we lack most of the contextual information concerning their production, nature, and ritual significance (Jia Lianxiang 賈連翔 2014; Wang & Zhou 2015; Bian Xiaobing 邊晓冰. 2016).",-1200,300,1240,906,Flaminia Pischedda,2021-05-17 19:34:22.758 +0200,2021-09-28 02:04:15.700 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1100,Fanyin,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Fan yin 反淫 (“Against Excesses”) belongs to a collection of Han-dynasty bamboo-slip manuscripts donated by an anonymous alumnus to Peking University in 2009 (Beijing daxue chutu wenxian yanjiusuo 2011: 49); its provenance is unknown. Experts at the university dated it to the period between the reigns of Emperor Wu 武 (r. 141-87 BCE) and Emperor Xuan 宣 (r. 74-49/48 BCE) [Beijing daxue chutu wenxian yanjiusuo 2011: 50]. The editors of the Fan yin think it was composed in the early Western Han period (which began in 206 BCE) based on its literary diction and calligraphic style. 

The Fan yin contains 1,225 graphs on fifty-nine slips with thirty-five of them intact without damage. On the back of its first slip (inventory number 2589) were written two graphs— “fan yin”—which do not appear together in the text itself; they are thus taken to be its original title. Written in the form of rhymed rhapsody (fu 賦), the Fan yin presents an imaginary conversation between Hun魂 (“ethereal soul”) who plays the physician and an ailing Pozi 魄子 (“corporeal soul”) in need of treatment, apparently due to his excessive indulgences, a condition indicated by the word yin (excesses) in the text’s title. 

In early China, it was widely believed that human beings were each endowed with a dual soul comprised of hun and po. This was probably the result of a fusion of soul beliefs in North and South China in the sixth century BCE. While po functions as the life principle of human beings which determines the life and death of a person, “hun is the seat of human emotions, feelings and sentiments as well as the center for willing—it is, in effect, an aggregate of psychological attributes in man. Such conception continued into the Han dynasty (Lo 2008: 26, 33). Yet, it was probably unprecedented when hun and po were turned into fictional characters in an imaginary dialogue some four hundred years later. In the Huainanzi 淮南子, a text of eclectic philosophy attributed to Prince Huainan (179 BCE-122 BCE), there was an exchange between the two souls on how to attain the Dao 道, where Po seeks counsel from Hun who has embodied it (He 1989: 1101-1102). Given its similar literary device, it is possible that the Fan yin might be written around the same time as well. As the opening of the text is missing, it is not clear if Pozi initially seeks treatment for his malady from Hun but after eleven ineffective attempts to lure Pozi with the extraordinary sensual pleasures of various sorts, Hun recommends him to invite friends and people who admire his “lofty aspirations” (高義) to play games and have fun together in his expansive and luxurious quarters. To this, Pozi is willing enough to oblige. But seeing his positive response, Hun goes one step further to entice him with a proposed gathering with learned men from all under Heaven such as esteemed statesmen (Su Qin 蘇秦 and Zhang Yi 張儀), respected philosophers (Mencius 孟子, Mozi 墨子, Yang Zhu 楊朱) and accomplished poets (Song Yu 宋玉, Qu Yuan 屈原and Jing Cuo 景差) from Warring States times which ended in 221 BCE. The purpose is to “examine with them the successes and failures of declining ages, discuss the subtleties of all under Heaven, and putting in order the this and that of the myriad things” (巧【=考】諸衰世之成敗，論天下之精微，理萬物之是非) with Confucius and Laozi as arbitrators in the audience (孔老監聽). Pozi’s interest is piqued indeed, yet an anti-climax is introduced when Hun decides on a still better therapy of roaming in the higher realm of “utmost purity” (至清), casting off the filthy bodily shell (蟬說【=蛻】濁薉【=穢】) in the process of spiritual transformation while “dwelling in the palace of leisure and quietude and attending court with the leather cap” (處閒靜之宮，冠弁以聽朝). The precondition for Pozi to attain such liberation is to remain “empty-minded, tranquil, serene, and relaxed” (虛靜恬愉). To do so, he must practice what Hun calls “engaging in the affairs of non-action and performing the teaching without words” (處無為之事，行不言之教)—a direct quotation from the Laozi. No sooner has Pozi heard the suggestion than he perspires profusely and recovers from his illness. Despite its obvious Daoist flavor, the philosophical and medical underpinnings of the Fan yin are rich, and meticulous analysis will reveal the interplay of Warring States thought and medicine in early Han times. 

More ostensibly, the Fan yin shows a striking resemblance to the Seven Stimuli (Qi fa 七發), a famous and influential rhymed rhapsody attributed to the scholar-official cum poet Mei Sheng 枚乘 (d. ca. 141 BCE) [Fu 2015: 144-150; Knechtges 2010: 665]. The Qi fa, structured in the format of a dialogue in which a persuader volunteers to offer advice to heal Prince of Chu who becomes bedridden with sensual excesses. He adopts a strategy similar to Hun’s in the Fan yin, trying to seduce the ailing prince, step by step, with further indulgence in rapturous music, lavish food and drink, sumptuous banquets, exciting hunting, and delightful wave-watching. Likewise he fails. It is only when he proposes to the prince to have an audience with fangshi 方士 magicians to “discuss the subtleties of all under Heaven, and putting in order the this and that of the myriad things” does he finally succeed. Upon hearing his suggestion, the prince sweats copiously and recuperates himself without actually listening to the “essential words and wonderful teachings” (要言妙道) promised with said meeting. Not only is the proposed activity identical to what Hun recommends to Pozi, but so is its immediate effect on the prince as well. The relationship between the Fan Yin and Qi fa deserves critical investigation and will shed light on the early history of rhymed rhapsody. Fu Gang 傅剛 argues that the Fan yin was an earlier work by Mei Sheng which functioned as a draft for the eventual product of Qi fa (Fu 2015: 171) but this is far from being conclusive.",-200,-100,1253,930,YK Lo,2021-05-20 02:54:26.961 +0200,2022-02-15 09:14:02.507 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This entry focuses on the Natchez around the time of 1718, before significant cultural change and the end of autonomous authority. Natchez religious beliefs center around a supreme high god or spirit known as Coyocop-chill who is described as a creator deity and is associated with the Sun. Other spirits and supernatural beings are present and ultimately ruled by Coyocop-chil. Natchez beliefs state that a man and woman, as earthly manifestations of the supreme high god, came to the Natchez and brought with them fire from the sun as well as customs and rules of governance and descent (Lorenz, 2020). The descendants of these godly individuals comprise the royal class, and the hereditary position of paramount chief is passed through this lineage. The paramount chief, or Great Sun, is both the political and religious leader. The supreme spirit is said to reside in the Great Sun. A temple contains the sacred fire brought from the sun; the Great Sun and temple guardians are tasked with ensuring the fire burns eternally.

1106,Old Kingdom Religion at Abydos,43,Religious Group (v6),"The site of Abydos was the necropolis for the Predynastic and most of the Early Dynastic rulers of Egypt imbuing it with a deep and significant history. With Djoser’s movement of the royal necropolis to the Memphite area in the Third Dynasty, Abydos became primarily a cultic site, a status which it would maintain throughout the Old Kingdom. The religious makeup of Abydos follows the state religion of Old Kingdom Egypt as reflected in the tombs of the Middle and North Cemeteries, although the landscape was specifically associated with a number of chthonic gods, giving the site particular religious significance. The principal god of Abydos at this time was Khentiamentiu, “foremost of the westerners,” a deity primarily depicted with a jackal head and intrinsically tied with the Abydene necropolis. Mention of Osiris, ""Lord of Abydos"" in the burial chamber of Weni has been used to suggest that Osiris, who would become the primary deity of the site in later periods, was also considered a principal god in the Late Old Kingdom, although this remains debated. Some stela from the Old Kingdom necropolis also mention the jackal god Wepwawet, “lord of Sn-Hr,” (see for example Louvre C160) although this god’s primary cult center was Asyut. His epithet has been suggested to refer to a specific, unknown location in the Abydos necropolis, likely located near the beginning of the processual route to Umm el-Qa'ab. The Abydos temple was originally dedicated to Khentiamentiu, and while the temple from this period has yet to be excavated, material excavated in the temple precinct suggests significant royal involvement at the site. With the increasing importance of Osiris, sometime between the late Old Kingdom and early Middle Kingdom Khentiamentiu became syncretized with Osiris, creating Osiris-Khentiamentiu, “Lord of Abydos.”",-2750,-2150,1266,921,Emily SmithSangster,2021-05-26 17:52:14.191 +0200,2021-06-02 23:41:19.023 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1109,Chan Buddhism in the Song,43,Religious Group (v6),"Originating from the early Mahayanian meditation (Skr. Dyana) practices, Chan禪 Buddhism gradually developed into a highly indigenous form in China since the sixth century. A famous, yet simplistic, four-part motto adapted from the Platform Sutra has been widely used by Chan communities to characterize the Chan idealogy: “special transmission outside the scriptures; not established upon words; directly pointing to human heart-mind; realizing the Buddhahood by seeing one’s Buddha-nature.” Chinese Chan Buddhism reached new heights during the Song. Unlike the decline of many Buddhist schools following the unrest of the late-Tang period (mid 8th-9th cent.), the Chan school continued to gain popularity during the turmoil times of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-979). To enhance their political regimes, regional rulers in southern China began to sponsor, instead of individual monks, multiple generations of Chan masters belonging to the same lineage. This pattern of state endorsement of Chan lineage families, institutions, and literature continued into the new dynasty of Song, which became a hallmark of Song Chan Buddhism. 

  The picture of a “Golden Age of Chan” embodied by noble Tang masters as painted in Chan literature has led to a long-standing stereotype that deterioration characterized much of the Song Chan Buddhism. However, behind such narratives reconstructed by the Song authors, modern scholars have begun to acknowledge that it was during the Song that the Chan school took its fully mature form. Intellectual and artistic achievements associated with Song Chan Buddhism have significantly enhanced Chinese culture in general. New developments within Song Chan Buddhism have had a profound impact on the Chan traditions (Jpn. Zen; Krn. Seon) throughout East Asia. 

  Compared to its earlier stages, Song Chan Buddhism presented many new features that would continue to dominate the Chinese religious landscape for several more centuries. First and foremost, Song Chan Buddhism distinguished itself by the advent and expansion of new styles of Chan literature: Gong’an公案 (Jpn. Koan), or “public cases,” are short stories of a Chan master’s commentaries on a previous dialogue or vignette of a past Chan patriarch. Gong’an became a standardized Chan literature genre from the eleventh century and was used largely as a pedagogical tool to elicit doubt and sudden enlightenment from the disciples. Yulu語錄, or “recorded sayings,” documents the sayings of great Chan masters and were popular among both monastic communities and elite sponsors. Qinggui清規, or “rules of purity,” provides detailed guidance for Chan monastic life. Denglu燈錄, or “lamp histories,” are narratives of a fairly coherent Chan family lineage starting from the Sakyamuni Buddha to Bodhidharma, down to the Chan masters of the Song. It was from such abundant literature that a distinct ""Chan"" identity emerged, emphasizing the lineage transmissions and the master-disciple relations.  Second, Chan Buddhism during the Song maintained unusual relations with the imperial circles. The compilation of Chan literature, especially that of the denglu燈錄, was under the collaboration of Chan communities and high court officials, often entitled with the name of a particular imperial era. It was also during the Song that public monasteries (as opposed to private hereditary monasteries where the succeeding abbacies could be decided by private sponsors and the current abbots) of Chan began to receive state sponsorship, official recognition, and political regulation with their abbacies appointed by the government.  Third, while many sects -among which the Yunmen雲門, Linji臨濟, and Caodong曹洞 were the most dominant- coexisted during the Song, in comparison with the competent histories of Tang Chan (especially the confrontation between the ""Southern"" and ""Northern"" schools), Song Chan Buddhism displayed a non-sectarian nature in general. The major doctrinal dispute, however, was perhaps the different approaches to enlightenment between Mozhao默照, “silent-illumination” (enlightenment through silent meditation) and Kanhua看話, “reflection on gong’an” (enlightenment through concentration on gong'an stories), which were advocated by sects of Caodong (Jpn. Soto) and Linji (Jpn. Rinzai) respectively. Despite doctrinal differences, the rise and fall of Song Chan lineages, as suggested by recent scholarship, were more closely associated with the change of regional sponsor networks. Fourth, apart from its distinct lineage identities, the Chan school shared common monastic practices and rituals with other contemporaneous Buddhist groups. The syncretistic tendencies of Song Chan Buddhism–especially with the Pure Land practices–would continue through the Yuan (1271-1368) and became more prominent in Ming (1368-1644) Chan Buddhism.",960,1279,1255,945,Xuejing Sun,2021-05-27 19:35:50.990 +0200,2021-09-28 02:23:56.286 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1110,Twana,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the Twana, also known as the Southern Coast Salish, around the time 1860. This entry relies predominantly on information from William Elmendorf (1960), the principal ethnographic authority according to the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (Murdock and White, 1969). Elmendorf (1960) presents ethnographic data collected between 1939 and 1956, which aims to reconstruct an account of the Twana as they existed around the time of 1860; prior to significant cultural changes as a result of Euro-American influence. At this time, the Twana was comprised of a group of villages living in the Hood Canal area of Washington, United States of America. Winter villages each contained a single house group and were the primary economic and social unit. During summer, the winter villages dispersed into smaller units and focused on subsistence gathering (e.g., hunting and fishing) and food preservation for winter use. The Twana did not possess a formal village community political leader, but high-class men held prestige and influence among their communities. Although the Twana did not have formal political leaders, the people were united by a shared language and culture. Relations between village communities were important and involved ceremonial and religious activities. 

One of the most prominent aspects of Twana religious beliefs involved guardian spirits; these supernatural beings entered into helpful relationships with individuals and conferred special powers. Guardian spirits were acquired by following a set of ritual activities including a training period and vision quests. According to Elmendorf (1960), the guardian spirit complex was “one of the most important expressions of the Twana worldview” (p.481). Guardian spirits were generally classified in two categories based on their powers: shaman or curing/diagnostic vs. all others (which were then subdivided into specific categories such as wealth powers, war powers, ceremonial powers, or sea-mammal hunting powers). Shamanism was a specialization within the guardian spirit concept, and shamans received their powers after acquiring a shaman guardian spirit. Besides guardian spirits, Twana supernatural beings included spirits of the dead, as well as other spirits/entities. Public rituals and ceremonies were an important aspect of Twana life; these events took place in either an inter- or intra-community setting. Because Twana religion did not exist in a distinct sphere of their society and culture, this entry considers the Twana religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1845,1875,1256,577,Emily Pitek,2021-05-27 21:54:04.804 +0200,2021-08-31 20:29:41.751 +0200,eHRAF
1112,Xifang Helun 西方合論,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Xifang Helun 西方合論 is a text published in 1599 by Yuan Hongdao 袁宏道 (1568-1610). In it, he exhorts readers to adopt the practices of Pure Land Buddhism, desist from antinomian Chan (Zen) 禪 practices, and engage in moral self-reform. In addition, he answers criticisms of Pure Land Buddhism with reasoned arguments and scriptural citations.

Yuan himself was widely known in his own day. Despite his short life, he accomplished almost everything that a member of the literati élite aspired to. He passed the highest levels of the civil service examination at an early age, got a prestigious position in the imperial bureaucracy, gained fame as a poet and literary theorist, and participated in high-level conversations about the intellectual topics of the day, including Chan Buddhism. One of his most influential friends was the iconoclastic Buddhist layman and social critic Li Zhi 李贄(1527-1602), widely associated with the movement known as “Crazy Chan” (Ch.: kuang chan 狂禪). However, their relationship soured after ten years, and it was partly in response to the antinomian tendencies that Li represented that Yuan composed the Xifang helun.

Many of Yuan’s peers looked down upon Pure Land practice as a mere devotional exercise fit only for the peasant classes. Within the ten chapters of this work, Yuan sought to show that Pure Land had wide scriptural support in the most esteemed Buddhist scriptures, that great Buddhist intellectuals of the past such as Nagarjuna had supported it, and that it was consistent with the highest expressions of Buddhist philosophy. He also threw challenges back at Pure Land’s detractors: were they really as enlightened as they claimed? For example, to those who said Pure Land displayed a false dualism between purity and impurity, Yuan caustically asked: if you understand that the two are ultimately the same, can you jump into a latrine and swim around? If not, then maybe you need Pure Land practice. Finally, he advises adherence to all the moral practices of Buddhism such as a vegetarian diet and keeping the Five Lay Precepts.

The book was widely popular. Editors of the Jiaxing Buddhist Canon included it, the influential Pure Land monk Ouyi Zhixu 蕅益智旭 (1599-1655) included it in his Jingtu shi yao 淨土十要 (Ten Essential [Texts] of Pure Land). Decades later, a patron commissioned the painter Chen Hongshou陳洪綬 (1598-1652) to portray the initial public presentation of the Xifang helun in a painting called Elegant Gathering (yaji tu 雅集圖), completed in 1646 or 1647.

1113,The Double-Basilica at Thasos (Aliki),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The double basilica at Aliki is an elusive and unprecedented ecclesial complex on the island of Thasos. Its history as a structure in a seemingly constant state of expansion or reconstruction has led to much speculation, ambiguity and contradiction in analysis of its various architectural and archaeological programs and function(s). Notably, scholars have struggled to address various fundamental issues, from the chronology of its building phases, (contextual) influences from other structures on the peninsula, to the practices of the local Christian community. Therefore, this entry strives to illuminate the general questions and theories postulated by past research, proposes possible solutions and offers some avenues for future exploration and consideration of the site, with marked emphasis on the rationale for constructing the twin ecclesial structures and what the architecture of the site suggests vis-à-vis the early Christian community on Aliki, particularly in terms of baptism ritual(s) within the complex.",350,500,601,279,Robyn Walsh,2021-05-28 17:37:13.908 +0200,2021-11-10 17:40:12.031 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1117,Ancient Egyptian Book of the Earth – Tomb of Ramesses VI,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The sarcophagus chamber of Ramesses VI (Dynasty 20, c. 1145–139 BCE) in the Valley of the Kings, west of modern Luxor, was decorated from floor to ceiling, on all finished wall surfaces and three column faces, with scenes and texts from an ancient Egyptian cosmological work known today as the “Book of the Earth” (ancient title unknown). This “book” was in fact one ad hoc collection drawn from a stock pool of imagery relating to the subterranean regions of the Duat, where gods and the dead were believed to reside. In total, eight royal monuments from the later New Kingdom (Dynasties 19–20) included elements from the Book of the Earth, of which the version of Ramesses VI is by far the largest and most elaborate. After the New Kingdom, elements from the Book of the Earth began to appear on non-royal papyri and other mortuary equipment. Scenes belonging to the Book of the Earth depict a wide variety of chthonic entities, whom the sun god — and by extension, the deceased king — was believed to encounter during the nocturnal portion of his cyclical journey through the cosmos. The Book of the Earth divided its scenes of the divine realm into two large halves, designated by convention as “A” on the left (when facing the rear of the tomb) and “B” on the right. The Book of the Earth was paired typically with images of the sky on the ceiling directly overhead, which might depict either anthropomorphized constellations or the cosmos-spanning sky goddess. Such celestial images were inherently directional: In the tomb of Ramesses VI, the sky goddess appears with her day- and night-time forms back to back, with her head in the west and her feet in the east. Extending the directionality of the ceiling to the Book of the Earth scenes on the walls below it permits us to identify the “A” group, on the left, as the western half of the underworld, where the sun initially sets at dusk, while the “B” group, on the right, corresponds to the eastern half of the underworld, from which the sun ultimately rises at dawn. Other important themes include the union of the sun god with his counterpart Osiris, the punishment of the Damned, and the transit of the solar barque through the underworld, personified as a double lion or sphinx.",-1145,-1139,1260,948,Joshua Roberson,2021-05-28 20:26:05.876 +0200,2021-06-04 14:36:41.595 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1119,Karnak Temple (New Kingdom),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The temple of Karnak stands today on the East Bank of the Nile river, surrounded by the modern city of Luxor. The main temple precinct, a cult center dedicated to the ancient Egyptian god Amun-Re, is today defined by a trapezoidal monumental mud-brick wall. This likely encloses a larger area than the temple walls of the New Kingdom, as the precinct continued to grow and expand throughout the Pharaonic Period. The earliest evidence for cult construction on the site dates to Dynasty 11 and 12 (the Middle Kingdom); in the New Kingdom the temple was significantly reimagined and took on the form that characterized the rest of its active life, with a series of monumental pylons and grand enclosures. Other surrounding sites considered part of the larger suite of Karnak temples were also important ritual spaces in the New Kingdom, including temples at North Karnak (associated with the god Montu), East Karnak (associated with the god Aten and built in the early reign of Akhenaten), and South Karnak (associated with the goddess Mut, considered the consort of Amun-Re). A formal processional way linked Karnak to the Temple of the Goddess Mut and the temple of Luxor to the south, both of which also underwent important monumental construction phases during the New Kingdom. Karnak and the other Theban temples were connected by a series of religious festivals and processional routes at this time, and the architecture of all the (especially East Bank) temples should be considered as part of a larger, integrated ritual landscape. The Amun-Re temple experienced a frenzy of construction in the New Kingdom, with most kings of Dynasties 18-20 building (or at least inscribing) some structure at the site.  A formerly rather obscure god local to the area, Amun rose to prominence and was joined with the sun god Re. He became closely tied to kingship, and is depicted in New Kingdom reliefs at Karnak personally crowning the Pharaoh, perhaps explaining the lavish constructions gifted to him by the kings of the time. Alongside Memphis, Thebes – centered at the Amun-Re temple – was one of the two most important religious and political centers of the New Kingdom.  

Karnak temple is frequently referred to as Ipt-swt in the Egyptian language (“the most revered of places”) and the city itself (and the larger administrative unit it headed, called a nome) was termed Waset (“Egyptian Thebes” is a later Greek name for the town).",-1550,-1086,1262,880,Elaine Sullivan,2021-05-28 22:04:21.034 +0200,2021-07-10 20:22:14.375 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1120,Liji 禮記,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Liji 禮記, translated as ""Record of Rites"" or ""Book of Rites"", is a collection of essays on rituals and ritual principles written between the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.E.) to the Han Dynasty (202 B.C.E.-220). Scholars conventionally believed that this anthology belonged to the Confucian tradition and was recorded and compiled by Confucius’s disciples. The received Liji has been said to be transmitted by Dai Sheng 戴聖 (fl. 1th century B.C.E.) in the Han and called Xiao Dai Liji 小戴禮記 alternatively to differ from the Da Dai Liji 大戴禮記 transmitted by Dai Sheng’s uncle Dai De 戴德 (fl. 1th century B.C.E.). The Liji, the Yili 儀禮, and the Zhouli 周禮 were known together as Sanli 三禮. Nevertheless, the three Classics have different focuses. The received Liji has 49 chapters in total, and although they also touch upon various idealized rituals which were thought to be institutionalized in high antiquity, including sacrifice, wedding, capping, and funerary rituals, the Liji chapters concentrate on discussing the principles behind the ritual and social norms. For instance, the ""Daxue"" 大學 chapter detailed the steps through which one could successfully govern the world, while the ""Liyun"" 禮運 chapter illustrated how an ordered society could be achieved when propriety could be applied in reality.
Zheng Xuan’s 鄭玄 (127-200) commentary on the Liji, which we can now read from the Wujing Zhengyi 五經正義 recension in which Kong Yingda’s 孔穎達 (574-648) sub-commentary were also included, is probably the earliest surviving and most authoritative commentary among others, even though revisions and criticisms of Zheng Xuan’s commentary can still be found in our available materials.
Recent archeological excavations have discovered numerous manuscripts which are counterparts and variants of the chapters being incorporated into the anthology under discussion. The textual parallels of certain Liji chapters suggest that the chapters (or even sections) of the Liji had been circulated separately and independently before they reached their current form. For instance, both the Guodian and Shanghai Museum collections of the Chu bamboo-slips contain counterparts of a chapter entitled “Zi Yi” 緇衣 in the Liji. The excavated versions of the “Zi Yi” are different from the transmitted one. Putting aside the difference in their wordings and lengths, scholars have recognized that a major difference is their sequences.
That Liji chapters were first transmitted and circulated separately and that there was the difference in the textual sequence of certain received Liji chapters were also acknowledged by certain Daoxue 道學 (better known as Neo-Confucian) fellows, such as Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130-1200) in the Song Dynasty. Arguing that the “Daoxue” 大學 and “Zhongyong” 中庸 chapters of the Liji should be extracted from the anthology, Zhu Xi believed that both texts were as of equal importance to the Analects and the Mencius and that the four texts should be put together to form the Sishu 四書 (Four Books). Zhu Xi even rearranged the sequence of the “Daxue” and added a new sentence. Zhu Xi’s recension of the “Daxue” and “Zhongyong” had become the standard version for imperial examinations since 13th century when Zhu Xi’s teachings were accepted as state orthodoxy.",-551,1911,1263,944,HinMingFrankie Chik,2021-05-28 23:35:09.552 +0200,2022-01-25 22:22:04.280 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1123,Ancient Egypt - Tomb of Amenmose TT318,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The tomb-chapel of Amenmose is located in the ancient Theban necropolis, on the western bank of Luxor, Egypt, in an area called the Valley of the Nobles. It is found at the bottom of the hill of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna. Sheikh Abd el-Qurna necropolis is an area with the highest concentration of tombs of prominent personalities of the Eighteenth dynasty. The tomb of Amenmose (TT318) belonged to the stonemason of god Amun or worker of the necropolis of god Amun. His activities appear to have been linked to the temple of Amun, the main administrative institution of the New Kingdom. He lived during the reign of either Thutmose III or maybe Hatshepsut.
The monument, which is carved into the rock, has two rooms and is decorated with paintings, reliefs and hieroglyphic texts that need to be copied and preserved so that they do not deteriorate or are lost forever. These valuable pictorial and written records of human history, over 3500 years old, need to be published and disseminated to be made known widely. The decoration of the tomb of Amenmose consists of painted scenes, while the jambs, lintel and the southwestern wall of the passage that connected the transversal to the inner hall South Wall have remains of carved scenes and inscriptions.
Ritual scenes are depicted on its walls. Among the scenes that decorate the monument, it is possible to find the process of agricultural production at its various stages: soil preparation, planting, harvesting, gathering and threshing; the production of bread and preparation of wine and meat, hunting and fishing scenes, banquets accompanied with music played with the lyre and double flute; scenes of offerings in which Amenmose, his wife and son participate; the worship of the gods and goddesses, among others. These images are catalogued as ""scenes of everyday"". They are present in the tomb of Amenmose, as in other Theban tombs of the Eighteenth dynasty (1550- 1295 BC), constituting one of the greatest sources of information of ancient Egyptian society.",-1500,-1400,136,940,Andrea Zingarelli,2021-06-02 19:39:48.605 +0200,2022-01-03 20:24:16.147 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1124,The ancient Egyptian Book of Two Ways,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A composition that is part of the broad category of ""spells"" known to Egyptologists as the Coffin Texts. These are known mainly from inscribed coffins of the early second millennium BCE. They were intended to assist in the transfiguration of the deceased and their successful passage to the afterlife, although many spells probably had non-mortuary origins. The Book of Two Ways consists of the spells CT 1029–1185, and is most frequently found in a combined pictorial–textual form, where spells are incorporated into what is arguably a diagrammatic representation of an underworld realm with various architectural and topographical features. This representation occasionally features figural images of gods, ""demons"", and fabulous beings believed to inhabit the underworld. The composition is named for one of its sections, which depicts two meandering bands that have traditionally been interpreted as routes through the underworld. The spells encompass ritual utterances (in the first, second, and third person), short labels to images, and more extensive descriptions of images. Much of CT 1131–1185 comprises variants of CT 1029–1130; the numbering system was based on early typologies of the composition and methods of collating the Coffin Texts for publication. All coffins (or fragments thereof) that feature the composition belonged to members of the elite who held office in the region of the 15th nome of Upper Egypt (the Hare nome), and who were buried at the site of Deir el-Bersha. Many spells mention Thoth, who was associated with the nome capital Hermopolis.

1127,Anglican Church of Korea,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Anglican Church of Korea is a Christian denomination belonging to the Anglican Communion, the global family of churches with roots in the Church of England. Among the many Christian bodies in South Korea, the Anglican Church ranks among the smaller denominations, though it has experienced steady growth in recent years. The current membership numbers around 65,000 communicants. The Anglican Church is distinctive in incorporating both Roman Catholic and Protestant elements in its theology, organization, and worship. The church is divided into three dioceses, Seoul, Busan, and Daejeon, each headed by a bishop, and the three bishops rotate the national leadership as archbishop. Worship in the Anglican Church is similar to Roman Catholic practice, with ornate clerical vestments and said or chanted prayers. It also has monastic orders of monks and nuns. And yet, like other Anglican bodies, it is officially Protestant. The church does not recognize the authority of the pope and departs from Roman Catholic tradition in other ways, as in the ordination of women. Moreover, the Anglicans are different from both the Roman Catholics and Protestants in Korea in embracing more open and progressive views on such social issues as LGBTQ rights. In the past, church members have been active in the democratic movement, and one of the priorities of the church today is the reunification of the Korean peninsula. The first Anglican missionaries arrived in Incheon in 1890, under the leadership of Bishop Charles John Corfe. In laying down the church’s foundation in Korea, they established churches, as well as schools and hospitals throughout the country. The Anglican missionaries and clergy emphasized sensitivity to Korean culture. They built many churches in the traditional Korean style, and two of their bishops, Mark Napier Trollope and Richard Rutt, were pioneering scholars in Korean studies. During the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), the Anglican Church was unique among Protestant bodies in having both the Koreans and the Japanese, as well as the English, work together with equal rights. In 1923, the church established St. Michael’s Theological Institute to train its clergy; it later expanded to become Sungkonghoe University, a major institution of higher learning in South Korea. In 1924, the cathedral Church of St. Mary the Virgin and St. Nicholas, the only example of Romanesque architecture in East Asia, was erected in Seoul. The first native Korean priest, Mark Kim (Kim Huijun), was ordained in 1915, and the first Korean bishop, Cheonhwan Lee, was installed in 1965. From its founding, the Anglican Church in Korea had been under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

construction of the Hellenistic city of Dion. The previous riverbeds were definitely on the east of the Isis sanctuary,
but it is still unknown precisely at what distance.
The buildings of the sanctuary of Isis surround a central court that has an altar in the center and four
temples on the west side. The principal temple was built on a high podium and was accessible through five marble stairs. Two porticos stretch on the north and the south side, one on each side, with auxiliary spaces and rooms, both for the visitors of the sanctuary and for the priests, while the main entrance is situated on the east side. Most of the buildings have been dated to the Severian period.
The excavations also revealed previous Hellenistic phases of construction under the central temple of the
sanctuary. 
The sanctuary revealed a large number of sculptures, both statues, and reliefs, during its excavations. In total, the 19 sculptures, seven of which are inscribed reliefs, cover a broad chronological range from the Hellenistic times to the third century CE. Among these sculptures, there are representations of Greek divine figures, such as Aphrodite, Artemis and Poseidon.

Zhiyi made two sojourns to Mount Tiantai, a mountain in southeastern China, and asked in his will that the Sui Prince Yang Guang build a monastery there. The school was subsequently named after the mountain, which literally means “platform of the sky.” 

The Tiantai School was not formed by the time  Zhiyi died, but Guanding (561-632), one of his disciples, constructed a Tiantai lineage by connecting Zhiyi to the historical Buddha, an Indian figure who had lived centuries earlier. This is considered by modern scholars “a watershed in the history of religious ideas” in that it constitutes a defining element in the development of group identity and sectarian consciousness within Chinese Buddhism. 

The intellectual foundations of Tiantai took shape in a period when a long-divided China was transformed into a unified state. Zhiyi, originally from an elite family in the south, integrated Buddhism as philosophy popular among southern elites at the time, with meditation techniques that he inherited from his teacher Huisi (514-577), a northerner. As a result, Tiantai is characterized by a strong philosophical content and at the same time an emphasis on meditative practice; these are considered the two wings of a bird. 

Tiantai was deeply influenced by the Madhyamaka philosophy of Indian Buddhism and developed the Madhyamaka idea of Two Truths (i.e. the absolute truth and the conventional truth) into Three Truths (or the Threefold Truth): 1) all things are empty in the sense that they are produced through causes and conditions and therefor have no self-nature; 2) they do have tentative or provisional existence; 3) being both empty and provisional is the nature of everything, which is the Truth of the Mean. 

Tiantai believes that all beings can be divided into ten realms — the hell dwellers, hungry ghosts, animals, human beings, demigods, heavenly gods, voice hearers, pratyeka-buddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. In Tiantai thought, these are so interwoven and interpenetrated that they are “immanent in a single instant of thought.” In other words, in every thought-moment, all possible worlds are involved. For the same reason, after a doctrinal debate within Tiantai in the 10th – 11th  century, the idea of “inherent evil in nature” or “inherent inclusion” became orthodox. It is believed that human nature, as well as the nature of all beings, contains the nature of beings of other nine realms, which is to say, humans, buddhas, hell dwellers and so forth all have both good and evil in their nature. This idea distinguishes Tiantai not only from other schools of Chinese Buddhism, which consider the Buddha Nature purely enlightened and good, but also from mainstream Confucianism, which believes that all humans are born with a purely good nature. This feature attracted supporters to Tiantai in the late imperial era (16th - 19th centuries), who tended to challenge Confucian ideology. 

Like other schools in Chinese Buddhism, Tiantai as a religious group is not congregational and thus its organization has remained loose and its identity fluid. Except for about a dozen of eminent monks historically recognized as patriarchs in the Tiantai lineage, most monastics and lay Buddhists do not strongly identify themselves with any particular school and usually study under masters specializing in various schools. For this reason, Tiantai had been studied by modern scholars mainly as school of philosophy and doctrines. But this approach, equating Tiantai Buddhism simply with its philosophy, tends to eclipse the significance of Tiantai’s social network, its contributions to Buddhist rituals and communal life, and other important aspects that more and more scholars have been taking on in their research on Tiantai.",538,2022,1278,962,Lang Chen,2021-06-16 20:21:58.249 +0200,2022-05-24 20:47:43.372 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1135,Tiger Hill,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Tiger Hill was a major site for popular religion and Buddhist worship. As the supposed site of the tomb of King Helu of Wu 吳王闔廬/闔閭 (r. 514-496 BCE), one of the most powerful political leaders of the Eastern Zhou dynasty (771-475 BCE) this location was preserved as both as a historical monument within easy reach of his former capital city at Suzhou 蘇州, and as a site with significant local superstitions attached to it. These superstitions concerned the appearance of supernatural tigers at this place (hence the name): tigers that were believed to be transmutations of the precious swords buried with the great King Helu. Nothing is known of the history of this place from the time of King Helu to the Eastern Jin dynasty (317-429). At this time, Tiger Hill was donated by its two owners, the brothers Wang Xun 王珣 (349-400) and Wang Min 王珉 (351-388), to the Buddhist faith, and their residences became the East and West Temples. (All accounts of the founding of these temples, however, incorrectly date this event to 327). During the Tang dynasty, in the period 836-840, these two temples were destroyed, and replaced by a single foundation: the Yunyan si 雲岩寺 (Cloud Cliff Temple) or Yunyan chan si 雲岩禪寺 (Cloud Cliff Chan Buddhist Temple). A pagoda was added during the Sui dynasty and rebuilt in 978 (the present structure). By this time, Tiger Hill was well-established as the most prestigious religious site in the greater Suzhou area, and there was considerable competition among elite lineages and organizations to establish shrines and monuments there. As a result, there was almost constant construction and renovation underway at Tiger Hill, and any sheer rock surface is heavily inscribed with the calligraphy of distinguished visitors. By the Ming dynasty, Tiger Hill was well established as one of the most important destinations for internal tourism in China. Both secular and sacred structures continued to be erected until the Taiping Rebellion in 1860, when the site suffered severe damage. Rebuilt in 1871, worship would continue at this temple until 1945, when all the religious buildings except the Song dynasty pagoda were destroyed. Other parts of the site, however, were undamaged at this time. In 1961, Tiger Hill was declared a National-level Cultural Protection Unit (全國重點文物保護單位). During the Cultural Revolution, Tiger Hill was guarded by the PLA, and damage is thought to have been limited. Following restoration programs beginning in 1980, the site has been returned to something of its former glory, and in 2011, its importance for tourism was recognized by being designated an AAAAA tourist attraction.",-496,2021,1279,964,Olivia Milburn,2021-06-17 02:18:28.362 +0200,2021-09-28 02:01:56.216 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1136,The Fellowship of Goodness 同善社 (Tongshanshe),43,Religious Group (v6),"Tongshanshe, the Fellowship of Goodness, was one of the largest redemptive societies in China before 1949. It was also labeled as a counterrevolutionary huidaomen (会道门) group by the Chinese Communist Party. In Chinese, the term “huidaomen” is composed of three different words: hui, dao, and men. “Hui”, “Dao”, and “Men” refer to any organization, association, or society composed of people who share similar interests or religious ideas. It can be either religious or secular or even both. Essentially, huidaomen was never a unified, monolithic organization in Chinese society. It was more like a general category and a generic term the government used to describe all voluntary associations. The term “huidaomen” has its precedent in late imperial China under the name “White Lotus Teachings.” The White Lotus sect was originally a lay Buddhist movement initiated by Monk Huiyuan of Lushan in the early fifth century.  According to B.J. Ter Haar, the name “White Lotus” was used by non-elites as an autonym for lay Buddhist gatherings before the mid-fourteenth century.  From the sixteenth century on, “White Lotus” was more and more frequently used and finally became a label for all potentially rebellious groups related to religion. Ter Haar further points out that by the late Ming dynasty, Christianity, millenarian teachings, lay Buddhist, and even sexual techniques were all labeled “White Lotus.”  But people within such groups did not necessarily call themselves “White Lotus.” This label existed only in official propaganda. “White Lotus” was only a generic term without precise specifications. The government could use it as a political label for all the voluntary associations that had rebellious potentials. The PRC’s use of “huidaomen” came from the same logic of political labeling. In 2004, the Chinese Academy of Social Science published two-volume primary sources on huidaomen called A Collection of Historical Materials on the Chinese Huidaomen: Their Organization and Distribution across A Century. The sources of this collection mainly come from more than 3,500 local gazetteers published in the PRC after October of 1949. In this collection of sources, the compilation committee defines huidaomen clearly as “feudal associations that operated secretly in order to spread their religious teachings.”  The book points out that the term “huidaomen” began to be used since the early PRC when the new government noticed the widespread networks of secret societies in China. Based on the information provided by the more than three thousand local gazetteers in A Collection of Historical Materials on the Chinese Huidaomen and my own case study of Poyang County in Jiangxi, I accept a broader definition of huidaomen, as the Chinese Academy of Social Science does. Almost all voluntary groups in China were indeed labeled as huidaomen from the late 1940s onward in political campaigns. It is inappropriate to define huidaomen exclusively as religious societies. Tongshanshe was one of the largest nation-wide redemptive societies in China during the Republican Era. During the late Qing period, Peng Ruzun (1868-1950) of Yongchuan County in Sichuan Province (now Chongqing) who was a former follower of the Way of Anterior Heaven (Xiantiandao) established Tongshanshe. Peng advocated a secular way of religious practice that participants in the Tongshanshe could become immortals through self-cultivation without fasting or becoming monks. Such secularized and simplified religious practice was widely welcomed. In 1910, Peng left Sichuan and went to Beijing to preach. Peng’s trip to Beijing gained tremendous support from former aristocrats of the Qing Dynasty and the leading warlords, including Duan Qirui and Cao Kun. In 1917, during the warlord period, Tongshanshe officially registered at the Northern Warlords Government in Beijing. Tongshanshe also established its central headquarters in Beijing. The government then provided Tongshanshe with formal support in developing branches across China. By 1923, Tongshanshe had already established provincial-level organizations in all provinces in China.  In Beijing, Tongshanshe ran a publishing house that published a number of religious books on self-cultivation and morality. Tongshanshe also functioned as a charity organization providing support for funerals of ordinary people and mass education.  In 1925, Peng built another Tongshanshe headquarters in Wuhan and claimed that Tongshanshe had a membership of over one million people. The name “Tongshanshe” even became a “free-floating signifier” of similar self-cultivation groups which shows the exceptional popularity of Tongshanshe in China. According to my study, Tongshanshe was largely an elite-based religious organization. Tongshanshe members were primarily rich merchants and even local politicians. Such an elite base was in sharp contrast to many traditional sectarian groups in China which were more attractive to the marginalized groups. Tongshanshe embraced religious syncretism, similar to many new religious organizations since the late Qing. It had widely absorbed Buddhism, Daoism, and Chinese popular religion. But Tongshanshe was predominantly a salvationist group. According to Tongshanshe's teachings, humans were living in a morally degenerating society. Peng Ruzun claimed that the end of the world was coming -- only those who firmly believed in Tongshanshe's teachings would survive the final apocalypse. The interpretation of Tongshanshe's millenarianism was not unified. Tongshanshe in different regions responded to the ""end of the world"" in diverse ways. Many local Tongshanshe groups in Southern China absorbed local military forces and practiced traditional Chinese martial arts, believing that martial arts would protect people from the final apocalypse. Other people, possibly under Peng Ruzun's instruction, believed that a new emperor would be born in China and would defeat all secular political powers. Both the Nationalist Government before 1949 and the Communist regime after 1949 saw Tongshanshe as a leading counterrevolutionary religious organization. From 1927 to the end of the Nationalist regime in 1949 on mainland China, the Nationalist government banned Tongshanshe multiple times. Due to the Nationalist Government's weak control of rural society, however, such suppressive policies were not carried out effectively outside big cities. After 1949, the Communist Party launched waves of Anti-Counterrevolutionary Campaigns. Labeled as a leading huidaomen group, Tongshanshe organizations were fatally destroyed by such campaigns and basically disappeared on the mainland. Tongshanshe also established its organizations in Taiwan and many Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. It continues operating today.",1910,1951,1280,958,Yupeng Jiao,2021-06-18 07:56:20.693 +0200,2021-11-16 03:02:44.342 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1140,Early Medieval Confucianism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Early Medieval Confucians (Ru 儒) were individuals who were well-versed in the Five Classics (Wujing 五经) and their commentaries, as well as the Analects (Lunyu 论语) and the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing 孝经). They viewed the founders of their tradition as the Duke of Zhou (Zhougong 周公) and Confucius (Kongzi 孔子), which is why contemporaries sometimes called Confucianism ""The Teachings of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius"" (Zhou Kong zhi dao 周孔之道). Members of this group referred to their tradition using several other names as well, such as the Teachings of the Confucians (Rujiao 儒教), the Teachings of Confucius (Kongjiao 孔教), the Teachings of the Sage (Shengjiao 圣教), and Teachings of the Way (Daojiao 道教). Many early medieval Confucians believed in the existence of spirits and all agreed on the importance of sacrifices. However, offerings had to be made to gods (nature deities and ancestors) sanctioned in the Five Classics and worship could not be excessive. The most important religious rite was the emperor’s sacrifice to Tian 天 (Heaven) in the capital’s southern suburb. Of course, there were some Confucians, such as Fan Zhen 范镇 (ca.450-510), who denied the existence of spirits. Others, such as Huangfu Mi 皇甫谧 (215-282), thought that the deities of Heaven and Earth were vigorously surveilling human activities and manifesting auspicious and inauspicious omens to reward good and punish bad moral conduct. Early Medieval Confucians put a particular stress on perfecting themselves by behaving according to the Three Ritual Codes (Sanli 三礼): Book of Rites (Li ji 礼记), the Rites of Zhou (Zhouli 周礼), and the Book of Etiquette and Ceremonies (Yili 仪礼). Self-cultivation was inter-connected with social behavior: a Confucian cultivated herself/himself by fulfilling social roles and performing good deeds. Early medieval courts especially valued Confucians for their ritual knowledge and command of the Five Classics. As a result, they often served emperors as advisors on ritual matters, Erudies (boshi 博士) at the Imperial College, and as tutors to the imperial princes. For early medieval Confucians, the main purpose of government was to secure the welfare of commoners and enhance their moral fiber through the process of moral transformation (jiaohua 教化). This meant setting an example for others through one's personal conduct and establishing schools that taught the Five Classics and proper deportment. One did not have to hold public office to have a positive effect on others through moral transformation. Early Medieval Confucians frequently served in office, yet some, to maintain their moral integrity, chose to become recluses, such as Huangfu Mi. Oftentimes, they would then establish a private school at their residence. The loose social organization that underpinned medieval Confucianism was precisely the master-student networks created through schools. Early Medieval Confucians were by no means exclusivist. Several of them also embraced either Daoism or Buddhism. Although the inner chapters of Ge Hong’s 葛洪 (283-343) The Master who Embraces Simplicity (Baopuzi 抱朴子) are devoted to ways of seeking immortality, his outer chapters express a Confucian critique on social and political matters. Yan Zhitui 颜之推 (531-591) viewed Confucianism as the outer teachings, while Buddhism were the more important inner teachings. Nevertheless, other Confucians, such He Chengtian 何承天 (370-447) and Fan Zhen were vehement critics of Buddhism, while Sun Sheng 孙盛 (ca. 301-373) was well known for his criticism of Daoism.",220,589,1373,671,Keith Knapp,2021-06-24 20:47:56.552 +0200,2022-01-25 22:08:58.149 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1141,The Master of the Golden Tower (Jinlouzi 金樓子),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Master of the Golden Tower (Jinlouzi 金樓子) is a work of political, cultural, and literary thought written by Xiao Yi 蕭繹 (508-555), known posthumously as Emperor Yuan 元帝 (r. 502-555) of the Liang dynasty (502-557). Written over the course of its author’s life and likely intended to be continued beyond his untimely death, Jinlouzi consists of a series of chapters on topics ranging from the conduct of kings and their consorts, admonition for the author's sons, and funerary arrangements, to clever witticisms, book collecting, and tales of the marvelous. It is within these tales, part of Xiao Yi's chapter on ""Anomaly Accounts"" (zhiguai 志怪), that we get a glimpse of the author's interest in the supernatural, in those uncanny creatures and events whose veracity was often too epistemologically ambiguous to be included in standard histories. Writing these down in less formal contexts became something of a pastime for educated elites, as were the oral storytelling sessions whence those tales often came, giving rise to a milieu of tale writing that intersected with the miracle stories and hagiographies of the Buddhist and Daoist traditions, and which would have profound effects on the development of the literary genre of fictional narrative in subsequent centuries. Each of the chapters in Jinlouzi—fourteen in total in the extant text—proceeds in roughly the same manner, via citations from works past and present (including some of Xiao Yi's own previous writings) interspersed with the author's comments and reflections. In its form and scope, Jinlouzi belongs to the tradition of Masters Works (zishu 子書), a literary genre of long-form philosophical treatises with chapters on social, ethical, and political issues, often titled with the name or epithet of the author followed by zi 子 (""master""). Other books in this tradition include Liu An's 劉安 (179-122 BC) Huainanzi 淮南子 (The Master of Huainan) and Ge Hong's 葛洪 (282-343) Baopuzi 抱朴子 (The Master Who Embraces Simplicity). Xiao Yi’s work stands out in this tradition, as much for its relatively late date—the genre had lost some of its popularity beginning in the fifth century—as for its striking intimacy. In addition to the autobiographical preface (zixu 自序) that was a standard part of the genre, Jinlouzi contains many personal references to its author and his life, including lengthy biographies of both his father and mother, an entire chapter devoted to instructions and advice for his sons, an account of his personal book collection of 80,000 scrolls, and a discourse on the proper behavior of royal princes. Indeed, Xiao Yi seems to have written Jinlouzi with his position as one of the royal princes very much in mind, centering the majority of his work’s content on the concerns germane to life in that most exclusive echelon of elite society in the imperial palace. Xiao Yi was seventh son of the founder of the Liang dynasty, Emperor Wu 武帝 (given name Xiao Yan 萧衍 [464–549, r. 502–549]), and his older half-brothers were Xiao Gang 蕭綱 (503–551), who would later rule as Emperor Jianwen 簡文帝 (r. 549-551), and Xiao Tong 蕭統 (501–531), who is perhaps best known for his compilation of the literary anthology Wenxuan 文選. Xiao Yi finally took the throne after his brother Xiao Gang’s demise late in 552, but his was a short reign that lasted just over two years. His seat of power in Jiangling fell to armies from the Western Wei in 554, and he was captured and executed shortly thereafter. Before his death, he ordered that his massive book collection be burned, and thus Jinlouzi stands as a work that reflects much of the learning and thought of the sixth century elite, written by a prolific book collector who perpetrated what was perhaps the greatest bibliocaust since that of the Qin dynasty several centuries earlier.",502,557,1289,968,Dominic Toscano,2021-06-24 21:09:29.846 +0200,2021-09-28 02:26:02.062 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1143,Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The temple of queen Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari was a terraced ancient Egyptian temple of millions of years. It was dedicated to the cult of Amun, as well as Hathor and Anubis, Hatshepsut herself and her father Thutmose I also had their chapels here. Its construction started in the 7th year of the reign of Thutmose III and continued through all her life. It was situated in the valley at the foot of the mountain. The whole complex consisted of the Valley Temple, 1km-long processional alley and the main temple. The Hathor Shrine was a separate element, with its own architectural arrangement and a priest. The temple was oriented to the east, towards the 8th pylon in Karnak. It has undergone many architectural changes, although some elements have never been finished. Its architect was Senenmut, one of the queen's most trusted officials. In the late years of the reign of Thutmose III, the temple lost importance in favour of his temple built right next to it, on the south side. The decoration of the temple suffered many alterations, Thutmose III removed figures of the queen and her royal protocol or replaced them with those of his father, Thutmose II. During the Amarna period, almost all representations of gods and gods' barks were chiselled out. In the post-Amarna times, most of the gods' depictions were restored. In the Third Intermediate Period, the serious earthquake destroyed the Upper Terrace and the temple space began to be used as a graveyard for high officials and their families. During the Graeco-Roman period, the parts of the temple not damaged by the earthquake served as a place of the cult of Amenhotep son of Hapu and Imhotep, and a sanatory.",-1473,348,1211,881,Jadwiga Iwaszczuk,2021-06-27 16:53:07.972 +0200,2021-07-07 09:26:36.855 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1144,The Yijing 易經 (The Classic of Changes),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"One of the most influential texts in Chinese and East Asian history, the Yijing 易經 ( Classic of Changes) has long been known as “the first of the (Confucian) classics,” the most exalted of the five texts canonized in the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) in 136 BCE that formed the basis of the Chinese educational system until the collapse of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912 CE). The Changes originated as a divinatory text (usually referred to as the Zhouyi 周易, “Zhou Changes”) in approximately the 9th or 8th centuries BCE, one of many contending divinatory systems in the late Zhou period that scholars have only just begun to reconstruct using recently excavated texts. The basis of the Changes’ system is the “eight trigrams” (bagua 八卦), eight sets of three lines, each of which can be either broken __   __ or unbroken _____. Although several explanations have been offered for the genesis of these lines, for most of the text’s history they have been interpreted as representing the primary forces of the cosmos––yin 陰 and yang 陽––which combine in different patterns to structure every situation. These eight trigrams can be further combined into 64 hexagrams, each of which is composed of two of the primary trigrams. The divinatory system of the Changes involves randomly generating a hexagram, usually using yarrow stalks or coins, and then interpreting it in relation to a specific question or situation. The Zhouyi contains depictions of all 64 hexagrams along with their names, “line statements” (yaoci 爻辭), and “judgements” (tuan 彖) to aide readers in interpreting them. In the Han dynasty, the Zhouyi was combined with a set of texts referred to as the “Ten Wings” (shiyi 十翼). The Ten Wings are ten commentaries, written hundreds of years after the Zhouyi by multiple authors, which elucidate the basic text of the Zhouyi and articulate a moral and cosmological vision. These commentaries were typically ascribed to Confucius and shaped interpretations of the Changes throughout the imperial era (221 BCE – 1912 CE). According to the Ten Wings, the Changes provides its users with insight into the natural, impersonal patterns of the cosmos in order to allow practitioners to harmonize with those patterns and act appropriately in any given situation (Smith 2012, 3). Over time, thousands of additional commentaries were written by different authors under different historical, intellectual, philosophical, and religious circumstances. In all of these contexts, the Changes reflected the mentalities of its adherents, resulting in as many interpretations as interpreters and creating an intellectual tradition far more nuanced and complex than the intellectual categories familiar to most Sinologists. Indeed, this diversity is such that the editors of the Siku quanshu 四庫全書 (Complete Collection of the Four Treasuries) in the Qing dynasty claimed that “interpreting the Classic of Changes is like playing chess: no two games are alike, and there are infinite possibilities” (Smith 2008, 1). In addition, the Changes has exerted a formative influence on all aspects of Chinese culture, ranging from aesthetics to politics to law. It has further influenced the cultures of Vietnam, Tibet, Japan, and Korea, all of which have produced their own interpretations and transformations of the text. More recently, the Changes has spread throughout the globe and has been interpreted in relation to topics as diverse as modern psychology, mathematics, and biology. As a result, the transnational text of the Changes deserves to be thought of as “one of the great classics of world literature, on a par with religious classics such as the Bible, the Talmud, the Qur’an, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Lotus Sutra” (Smith 2012, 13).",-1554,2021,1290,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-06-28 22:12:46.141 +0200,2021-08-19 18:26:51.817 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1146,The Great Temple at Abu Simbel,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The rock-carved Great Temple at Abu Simbel was constructed under the Egyptian king Rameses II (reigned circa 1279-1213 BCE) and was dedicated principally to Re-Horakhty a manifestation of the sun god Re, with Amun-Re, Ptah and the deified Rameses II playing supporting roles. It lies in the far south of modern Egypt (in northern ancient Nubia) and was built over a period of approximately 20 years. It is unknown when the temple stopped operating—perhaps quite soon after the king's death—but by 600 BCE the entrance was already overwhelmed by sand and it was not reused as a Christian church. Together with the small temple—dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Rameses II's co-Great Wife Nefertari (see 'The Small Temple at Abu Simbel')—it was carved into blocks and reassembled on higher ground in the late 1960s before it would have been submerged under the artificial Lake Nasser created by the Aswan High Dam.",-1279,1968,1294,974,Nigel Fletcher,2021-06-30 11:37:28.892 +0200,2021-07-01 10:57:41.309 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1148,The Pyramid of Unas,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"In ancient Egyptian religious thought a pyramid was the same as the ben-ben, the mound of earth that came out of the dark waters of Nun, upon which the sun god alighted and created life. So, the pyramid was that same mound, but for rebirth in the afterworld, not birth for life on earth.
The building of pyramids started in the Third Dynasty, and continued until the end of the Thirteenth Dynasty, a period of slightly over a thousand years. The most famous pyramids, however, belong to the Old Kingdom, which lasted from 2686-2160 BCE. There were four dynasties that made up the period of the Old Kingdom, Dynasties Three to Sixth, and the pyramid of Unas belongs to the very end of the Fifth Dynasty. Unas was the last king of the Fifth Dynasty.
The pyramid was the most important structure in the pyramid complex built for the deceased king, because it actually contained his burial. The other structures in the complex were a Valley Temple, down at the small harbor where boats arrived, a causeway, a closed corridor which led up from the valley temple to the funerary temple, on the east face of the pyramid. The funerary temple is where the cult of the king was to be carried out for eternity. The ancient Egyptians believed that the living, the dead, and the divine, all had the same physical needs, and so the king was ""kept alive"", so to speak by the daily offerings at his temple.
There were a few other small structures or parts of a pyramid complex. On the south corner or side of the pyramid was a small subsidiary pyramid that scholars assume must have been for the soul of the king. There are also boat pits to contain the boats the the king will need for travel to and in his afterlife. All travel was done by water in ancient Egypt and so even the deceased and the divine cross the sky in boats. There were usually small pyramids for the wives of the king, but two of Unas's wives have mastaba tombs on the north side of the causeway, not pyramids.
The pyramid complex was laid out from east to west, so that the valley temple was in the east and the pyramid in the west, which was where the deceased went to join the afterlife. Pyramids of the Old Kingdom were always entered on the north side. After the king's body had been taken down into the pyramid and placed in the burial chamber, blocks of stone would be lowered into the corridor in the pyramid to seal it and protect it from being entered.
The corridor led down to a chamber usually referred to as the corridor chamber. Then on the west side of that was the burial chamber, and on the east side a tripartite chamber that is assumed to have been for funerary objects.
The pyramid of Unas is the first pyramid to have the religious texts known as the Pyramid Texts carved on the walls of the burial chamber and the corridor chamber. These spells were to help the deceased king into the afterlife to live in eternity. The use of Pyramid Texts might well reflect the growing importance of the god Osiris, the god of the dead, at this time.",-2345,-2315,1295,957,Lisa Sabbahy,2021-07-02 23:50:26.603 +0200,2021-07-19 19:10:29.316 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1149,Christianity in Tang China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christians in Tang China gave a Chinese name for Christianity: Jingjiao 景教, a term translated as ""the Luminous Religion/Teaching"" or ""the Illustrious Religion"" or ""the Brilliant Teaching"". Not a few scholars regard it as a ""Nestorian"" Church, a derogatory term used to call the Church of the East or East Syriac Christianity in the Western ecclesiastical traditions (Latin West and Greek East). The degree to which the Church of the East has to do with the Archbishop of Constantinople, Nestorius, who was condemned as a heresiarch during the Council of Ephesus (431), is a point that has been re-examined by a few patristic scholars. With the help of newly-discovered materials in Syriac, scholars such as James F. Bethune-Baker, Robert V. Sellers, Aloys Grillmeier, and Sebastian P. Brock began to question this ingrained preconception from the Western perspective. Scholars like Brock emphasize that the Syriac tradition, of which the Church of the East is a part, has a much earlier history than the so-called Nestorianism.

The story of Christianity in Tang China begins in 635 with the coming of Aluoben 阿羅本, a Persian波斯/Daqin大秦 monk who introduced his religion in front of the second emperor of the dynasty and paved the way for the spread of Christianity in the confines of the Tang empire. This story is recorded on the famous Christian stele discovered at Xi'an in 1623/5. The text of the inscription was composed by Jingjing 景淨, who was a priest and chorespiscopus of China. The stone was set in place in 781 probably in or near the Jingjiao temple in the imperial capital Chang'an (today's Xi'an). It proffers a brief history of Jingjiao in 146 years, which arguably echoes the rise and decline of the Tang empire. The presence of Jingjiao in the Tang period was also evidenced by Chinese official records, such as Tang Huiyao 唐會要 (Institutional History of Tang), and other Chinese documents by Buddhists or Daoists. The history of Jingjiao came to an end with the issue of the edict of 845, which initiated the persecution of Buddhism as well as other foreign religions including Daqin Jingjiao. However, historical documents of the 9th and 10th centuries mentioned that a few Jingjiao Christians still survived in China after 845.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, more documents and archaeological discoveries (like tomb epitaphs) have been found, especially at Dunhuang's Hidden Library. These documents not only confirm the authenticity of the stele but also enrich our knowledge of Jingjiao. The understanding of Jingjiao and the community of Jingjiao Christians, as shown in this entry, is built on the Xi'an inscription and these manuscripts, despite being fragmentary. These Jingjiao documents include Xuting Mishisuo jing 序聽迷詩所經 (“Book of Jesus-Messiah” or “Book of listening to the Messiah”), Yishen lun 一神論 (“Discourse on the One God”), Da Qin Jingjiao Sanwei mengdu zan 大秦景教三威蒙度讚 (“Hymn in adoration of the Three Persons and of salvation”), Zunjing 尊經 (“Book of Veneration”), Zhixuan anle jing 志玄安樂經 (“Book on attaining mysterious serenity and joy”), Da Qin Jingjiao Xuanyuan zhiben jing 大秦景教宣元至本經 (“Book of the proclamation of the highest origin of origins”), as well as Da Qin Jingjiao Dasheng tongzhen guifa zan 大秦景教大聖通真歸法讚 (“Hymn of praise for Great Holiness, attaining the truth, and returning to the dharma"").

In front of the stele and other Jingjiao documents, there was a community of Jingjiao Christians, who were mostly migrants of Iranian origin and spoke Persian or Sogdian. The bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) stele itself tells of their hybrid identity. On the one hand, Jingjiao was linked with the Church of the East in the Middle East. Syriac played a significant role in the theology and liturgy of Jingjiao. The hierarchy of the Church of the East is indicated on the Xi'an stele: both Chinese and Syriac names of the Catholicos Henanisho were engraved on the stele. On the other hand, the text engaged with the historical and religious contexts of Tang China by employing a few terminologies of the pre-existing Three Religions/Teachings (sanjiao, 三教), such as Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. This was the first attempt at transmitting the Christian ideas, such as Christology and the Trinity, in the Chinese language, more specifically in Middle Chinese. In the Jingjiao corpus, introducing the idea of the Only God, who Jesus Christ is, what the Messiah teaches were some major tasks of Jingjiao Christians.",618,906,1297,977,Dingjian Xie,2021-07-05 18:27:49.833 +0200,2021-10-18 12:48:36.037 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1153,Russian Orthodox Mission in Alaska,43,Religious Group (v6),"The first attempts to convert Alaskan natives to Russian orthodoxy were initiated by Russian fur trader Grigori Shelikhov (1747-1795) after he has founded a first Russian settlement at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak island in 1784. From the beginning of Russian colonization, Christian mission was part of the subjugation. The land taking was accompanied by a christianization of the landscape as many settlements got Christian names. Shelikhov’s missionary endeavor was nothing more than a crusade and therefore Kodiak natives resisted christianizing. By a decree of Tsar Alexander I in 1821, the Russian-American Company began to sponsor orthodox missionary efforts among Alaskan natives. Novo-Archangelsk became the seat of the bishop Inokentii Veniaminov (1797-1879). From the beginning, orthodox missionaries met the competition with Lutherans and therefore Veniaminov excluded Lutheran priests from his diocese. In order to secure loyalty from the Tlingits, the Russian Orthodox Church integrated natives into their missionary work. By 1845, Veniaminov founded a seminary for future native priests. Moreover, he encouraged missionaries to learn native languages and he himself edited an Aleut dictionary. In daily life natives often practiced syncretism, a symbiosis between orthodox and native beliefs in order to keep their religious self-identity under Russian colonial rule. After the Alaska Purchase in 1867, the number of converts decreased, but until the 21st century Russian orthodox parishes still exist.",1784,1867,1300,975,Eva Stolberg,2021-07-06 14:53:49.834 +0200,2022-11-08 23:42:29.940 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1154,The Cult of the Fox,43,Religious Group (v6),"The ""cult of the fox"" is not a cohesive religious group. Instead,  the name refers to a variety of relationships and interactions between humans and fox spirits in a range of accounts, most of the zhiguai 志怪 (""records of the strange"") genre. Accordingly, the cult of the fox can be considered part of Chinese ""popular"" or ""folk"" religion, itself a general term used to refer to various religious practices in China at the local level and outside of the major traditions of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. 

Fox spirits are known by many names, but are most frequently referred as huxian 狐仙. The cult is regional by nature and, in the 16th-20th centuries, was primarily located in the modern day provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Northern Anhui, and Jiangsu. These areas form the focus of this entry. In addition, there were sporadic mentions of the fox cult in Southern China and fox worship has been present in Manchuria from the 19th century to the present-day. Even further afield, fox worship can be found in both Korea and Japan, though a detailed study of those areas and the relationship of their worship to Chinese practices is outside the bounds of this entry. 

Generally speaking, there is no distinction made between huxian (""invisible fox spirits"") and living foxes as the latter are considered to be spiritual animals. In many instances, it is said that foxes are long-lived and that by cultivating themselves and learning secret arts over the course of their lifetimes they can become huxian. 

Because neither the fox cult nor the larger context of Chinese popular religion are closed, centrally-organized systems, huxian are thought to exist alongside a host of other human and non-human spiritual entities, including the ghosts of deceased humans, Daoist deities and immortals, gods and spirits from other popular traditions, and Buddhist Bodhisattvas and Buddhas. 

Within this array of spiritual entities, huxian are understood as liminal, and often subversive, figures, a trait that makes them perfect figures for negotiating and mediating between different forces and domains. Fox worship is thus highly personal in nature and humans can form a variety of different relationships with foxes. Accordingly, foxes are associated with complex family dynamics (often involving wives and daughters) and are frequently worshipped by marginalized groups such as prostitutes and entertainers. Most commonly, huxian are associated with spirit mediums, particularly female mediums, who have generally had little social status in the late imperial period, despite their services being sought out by all social classes. Although huxian can, at times, bring families wealth and prosperity (though not always via moral means), they are frequently understood as dangerous, vengeful, and even malign tricksters. Many huxian accounts describe them as possessing humans, seducing humans for sport, and even subjecting humans to forcible sexual encounters.

The sexual aspect of huxian has also led to their frequent association with female sexuality, conceived of as potentially dangerous to systems of patriarchal control. Indeed, the colloquial term ""fox essence"" (hulijing 狐狸精), which arises from fox cult practices, denotes the dualism of an enchanting woman's sexual potency and powers of lustful destruction in many literati works and popular lore up to the present. 

The liminal and sexual aspects of the huxian, as well as the potential for the personal concerns animating their worship to challenge established hierarchies, meant that their worship was frequently proscribed by the state. However, even suppressed, their worshiped served  as a vital source of support and efficacy outside of official religious channels, especially with respect to private or even criminal concerns.

In a number of cases, huxian are also domesticated and integrated into more conventional or orthodox systems. For example, stories about huxian brides frequently depict paragons of Confucian virtue who transform sexual and dangerous female huxian into demure brides. Similarly, huxian are sometimes associated with larger, more mainstream cults such as the Queen Mother of the West and even Guanyin, the Boddhisattva of compassion. Perhaps the most dramatic case is in the latter part of the Qing dynasty when huxian worship was used by state officials as a strategy for pacifying disturbances. As a result, huxian shrines were included in yamen offices and the huxian was even declared the ""great guardian of the official seal."" 

Huxian worship persists to this day in contemporary China. It continues to include spirit mediums and to occupy the marginal position that it has held throughout the centuries of the late imperial period.",1500,1950,1299,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-07-06 22:56:26.676 +0200,2021-11-05 01:01:27.646 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1155,The Pyramid Texts: Pyramid of King Unas (Wnjs),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Pyramid Texts is a modern name given to an Egyptian corpus of entextualized ritual utterances and religious texts that were inscribed on the walls within the burial chambers of royal pyramids in the later Old Kingdom. The corpus was fluid, altogether containing over 800 Pyramid Texts—individually called “utterances” or “spells”—although no source contains every Pyramid Text utterance.

The purpose of the Pyramid Texts as a whole was to ensure that the deceased passed safely into the afterlife to become an akh (ꜣḫ), or “effective spirit.” A large number of the ritual utterances in the corpus focus upon this transfiguration. Other utterances in the corpus represent mortuary and offering rituals, hymns to important deities, and apotropaic rituals for the protection of the tomb and the deceased.

This diversity of textual genres of utterances are evidence that the Pyramid Texts were compiled in part from diverse, pre-existing textual (and likely oral) sources. While many of the utterances originated in rituals composed and practiced specifically with the king as beneficiary, others have been demonstrated to have non-royal origins. This illustrates that the ancient editors of the corpus—likely high ranking priests and religious officials—drew upon a number of different sources when deciding which specific rituals and religious texts to incorporate into the Pyramid Texts corpus.

The first attested Pyramid Texts are in the tomb of King Unas (Wnjs, alternately romanized as Unis or Wenis), the last king of the Fifth Dynasty. The Pyramid Texts of King Unas are the best preserved of the Old Kingdom sources, but also only contain 226 of the ~800 total Pyramid Text utterances. The Fifth Dynasty was a time of great religous change during which the god Osiris (Wsjr) first appears in Egyptian religion. It is in the Pyramid Texts of Unas that Osiris first appears in a royal context.

After King Unas, the Pyramid Texts continued to be inscribed in the burial chambers of the pyramids of Sixth Dynasty kings, as well as some Sixth Dynasty queens. These later Old Kingdom sources added additional utterances and subtracted some as well, such that no two individuals’ tombs included the same repertoire of utterances. Although restricted to royal burials during the Old Kingdom, the Pyramid Texts were later revived and re-used throughout ancient Egyptian history in the tombs of non-royal individuals. Some utterances of the Pyramid Texts were also adopted into later mortuary corpora, including the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead.",-2375,-2345,1295,899,Brendan Hainline,2021-07-08 00:20:06.417 +0200,2022-03-25 19:14:10.922 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1156,Solovetski monastery,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Solovetski monastery is located 100 miles away from the Arctic circle on the Solovki Islands on the White Sea in Northern Russia and has been found in 1429 by the monks St. Herman and St. Zavvatii. The environment is uninhabited and remote, for the monks it was the ideal place for religious contemplation. St. Herman and St. Zavvatii inspired a debate on ascetic life in the Russian North in the 1430s and they served as a model for other monks. The problem was that some services of the orthodox church, i.e. performing the Eucharist, were restricted to priests. The archbishop of Novgorod, Ioan, in charge of the monasteries in the Russian North, sent a priest in order to spend Communion regularly. Most buildings of the monastery stemmed from the 1550s and 1560s. The monastery has four gates and eight towers, therefore it resembles a fortress. 300,000 acres of land were granted to the monastery by Ivan the Terrible. Most of the year, the place was isolated by thick ice, the monastery was only accessible between May and September. The monks were running some industries like salt-winning, fishery, forestry and hunting, mining of iron. In the mid-seventeenth century the Solovetski monastery had 350 monks and 600 to 700 servants and traders. The monastery had also an impressive storage of ancient manuscripts. Therefore, Solovetski monastery had an immense economic and cultural-religious significance in the Russian North and beyond. People of different social layer like landowners, merchants, and peasants went on pilgrimage to Solovetski monastery. After the Bolshevik October Revolution, the monastery became part of the Soviet labor prison system. During the atheism campaign most of the monks were murdered. In the first year of its establishment in 1923, there were 3,000 convicts, in the 1930s the number increased rapidly to 50,000.

1157,Ancient Egypt - The Tomb of Meryre II at Amarna (TA 2),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Meryra II was a high-ranking individual who lived under the reign of the 18th Dynasty king Akhenaten (1349-1332). His high rank and fundamental function in the court of Akhenaten are reflected in the titles he held: Royal Scribe, Steward, Overseer of the Two Treasuries, Overseer of the Royal Harem of the Great Royal Wife Nefertiti, and Favorite of Aten. His tomb is among 6 other rock-cut tombs of the Northern Group that occupy the west side of the northern east cliff of Amarna about 300 feet of the desert plain.

1158,Early Daoist text—Commands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao (Dadaojia lingjie大道家令戒),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This entry introduces one of earliest Daoist texts, the Commands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao (Dadaojia lingjie 大道家令戒). What the text upholds and criticizes, with the historical and social background of its composition, reflect percieved problems regarding certain aspects of contemporaneous practice in the face of community diaspora, from Hanzhong 漢中,a region of modern southeastern Shaanxi 陝西and northeastern Sichuan 四川provinces to the Wei 魏kingdom (220–266).

The Admonitions, which is deemed to be written in 255 CE, is the main part of a larger compendium known as the Commandments of the Celestial Master from the One and Orthodox Canon (Zhengyi fawen tianshi jiaojie kejing 正一法文天師教戒科經). This corpus contains the doctrines of the Celestial Master Movement (Tianshi dao 天師道), often regarded as the earliest Daoist community. Followers believe that the Celestial Masters was founded upon the relevations of Laozi 老子, a Covenant with the Powers that was both correct and unique in the world (Zhengyi mengwei 正一盟威) to Zhang Ling 張陵(fl. 142 CE) , the First Celestial Master, in the Swan-Call Mountain. So, Daode jing 道德經 that was said to be a work by Laozi was adopted as the primary text for believers’ physical and moral cultivation. The Celestial Masters’ base at the time was established in Hanzhong, as a theocratic state which was supported by twenty-four parishes (zhi 治), each of which was led by a libationer (jijiu 祭酒). However, after its leader, the Third Celestial Master Zhang Lu’s 張魯 (d. 216?) surrendered to the ruler of Wei, Cao Cao 曹操 (155–220), the community was forcibly dispersed. One group of followers was moved to Chang’an 長安, modern Xi’an 西安and its surrounding areas, and the other group was moved to Luoyang 洛陽and Ye 鄴 where is near modern Handan 邯鄲. Luoyang and Ye are not far, about 364 kilometers apart.

As part of the surrender, Zhang Lu, was granted the title “General Who Subdues the South” (Zhennan jiangjun 鎮南將軍) and relocated to Cao Cao’s Wei kingdom. Therefore, without a central authority, the power of the previous theocratic state in Hanzhong was somewhat thawed, leading to the system of twenty-four parishes being undermined. As a result, the theocratic state destabilized and the concern over the heterodox practices increasingly grew. The Admonitions was composed in order to rectify what was viewed as a decline in rules and corruption of doctrines. Given that it was written in the first person, some scholars have considered that the author would be Zhang Lu himself. However, such attribution seems dubious as Zhang Lu likely died before the Admonitions was written. Nonetheless, it is possible that the message was pronounced by a medium, perhaps one of Zhang Lu’s sons, in the voice of Zhang Lu that explains why the first person pronoun was adopted by the text. This speculation was first made by the Chinese scholar, Hu Shi 胡適(1891–1962) and then affirmed by Daoist scholars like Stephen R. Bokenkamp and Terry F. Kleeman. 

The text of the Admonitions describes what changes brought to the Celestial Masters after it relocated throughout the Wei kingdom and how to rectify the “incorrect practices” prevalent among the faithful. For instance, the Admonitions determined that since the fifth year of Grand Harmony 太和reign period (231 CE), those self-appointed libationers, whose promotions were not emanated from the “true pneuma”, violated the old regulations regarding the selection and appointment. The Admonitions cautioned that from the day of the release of the Admonitions, self-promotion was absolutely prohibited. Although the Admonitions was a criticism directed at the problems of the Celestial Masters, intriguingly, it ostensively eulogized the governance of the Wei and propagated the Confucian virtus that make it different from previous Daoist texts. It claimed that “the Wei, receiving [the mandate of] Heaven, drives away and exterminates [the evils].” So, the changes of the rhetoric can be seen in Admonitions when the leaders of the Celestial Master were assimilated into the authority. Despite little is know about the fate of the Celestial Masters once it left from Hanzhong, based on the Admonitions, a general picture concerning dramatic changes happened to the central organization, the religious specialists and the believers after Hanzhong diaspora can be sketched out.",200,500,1304,970,Wei Wu,2021-07-19 22:49:47.241 +0200,2021-10-29 05:38:24.843 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1160,Wuzhen pian 悟真篇,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Wuzhen pian (DZ 263.26, j. 26-30 and DZ 1017, j. 18, “Essay on the [Immediate] Awakening to Truth.” Also translated as “Chapters on Awakening to Perfection.” Its preface is dated to 1075, and its postface is dated to 1078) is a seminal Daoist inner alchemical work that underpins inner alchemy as the essential method for immortal cultivation. Inner alchemy (neidan, which literally means internal cinnabar, 內丹) refers to a range of esoteric teachings and practices derived from diverse theories including but not limited to correlative cosmology, laboratory alchemy (also known as outer alchemy, waidan, 外丹) and the teachings of Yijing 易經 (Book of Changes). Unlike the laboratory alchemy practitioners, who aim to achieve immortality by consuming magical potions made of minerals and herbs, those who practice inner alchemy focus on meditation. In meditative practices, they visualize the human body as a cauldron that refines the internal vital forces including essence (jing 精), pneuma (qi 氣), and spirit (shen 神) to produce an internal elixir, which will help them transcend. 

Wuzhen pian’s attributed author, Zhang Boduan 張伯端 (987?—1082), was worshipped as the founder of the Southern Lineage (Nanzong 南宗) of inner alchemy. The work was read as a commentary on the Zhouyi cantong qi 周易參同契 (Token for the Kinship of the Three According to the Zhouyi, DZ 999 and DZ 1004)—the earliest Chinese treatise on laboratory alchemy and granted equal importance in the teaching of inner alchemy. Most sections in Cantong qi were written as tetrasyllabic or pentasyllabic rhymed verses. A few other sections adopt the Sao style or prose style. 

Influenced by Cantong qi, Wuzhen pian also adopts the form of poetry. However, most sections in Wuzhen pian were septasyllabic quatrains or regulated verses, which are poetic forms that became dominant in the Tang dynasty (618—907). It also includes a section of song lyrics (ci 詞), a genre that became mainstream in the Song dynasty (906—1279). The Wuzhen pian’s adoption of the new poetic forms not only reveals the author’s mastery of poetry but also exemplifies the Daoist treatises’ achievement in introducing new contents to the literary tradition. 

The Wuzhen pian originally comprised eighty-one verses, which are divided into three sections: the first section consists of sixteen septasyllabic regulated verses that focus on the idea of “two times eight” mechanism, which embodies the dichotomy of yin and yang that functions with hexagrams; the second section includes sixty-four septasyllabic quatrains that incorporate the concept of the hexagram in the Book of Changes and the last pentasyllabic poem eulogizes the ideal of the Great Unity (taiyi 太一). Later, two additional sections were added: one section comprises twelve pieces of song lyrics following the tunes of Western River Moon (xijiangyue 西江月); the other contains thirty-two poems that elaborate on cultivation through Buddhist subjects. 

According to Zhang Boduan’s summary in the postface, the contents range from the teachings about “the ranking of vessels, the weight of medical ingredients, and the control of fire-phasing” to the method for distinguishing “the superiority and inferiority, existence and nonexistence, and auspicious and ominous.” The text’s highly esoteric and symbolic language indicates that oral instruction by a master was required during the learning process. Inevitably, its obscurity also led to various interpretations, stirring much debate among later commentators. While Wuzhen pian includes certain guidance for sexual techniques, commentators tended to disapprove of such contents. Instead, they emphasized the teaching of inner alchemy and the text’s relation to the Book of Changes. 

Two sets of Wuzhen pian’s inner alchemical concept were considered essential in later receptions. First, it inherited the theory of dual cultivation of nature and life (xingming shuangxiu 性命雙修) from the Zhong-Lü tradition, a Daoist meditative tradition that was active during the late Tang and regarded refining one’s nature (xing 性) and prolonging life (ming 命) as equally important. Second, it absorbs the theory refining essence, pneuma, and spirit, which was promoted by the Daoist master Chen Tuan’s 陳摶 (871—989), making these elements the key components for producing the internal cinnabar. 

Although the alleged author Zhang Boduan was active during the eleventh century, Wuzhen pian did not gain much attention until the mid-twelfth century. During the 1160s, many commentaries begin to appear, and the text itself becomes available in many editions. The edition that collects the earliest commentaries is a five juan version titled Wuzhen pian jizhu 悟真篇集註, which is mentioned in Zhizhai shulu jieti 直齋書錄解題, one of the most influential private book collection catalog composed by the Southern Song literatus Chen Zhensun 陳振孫 (1179－1262). Some major commentators and compilers include Weng Baoguang’s 翁葆光 (c. 12th century), Xia Yuanding 夏元鼎 (c. early 13th century), and Chen Zhixu 陳致虛 (b. 1290). The Taoist Canon: A Historical Companion to the Daozang edited by Kristofer Schipper and Franciscus Verellen provides a comprehensive list of Wuzhen pian editions and inspired works. 
About the later transmission of the treatise, the Wuzhen pian probably influenced the Northen Lineage of inner alchemy, which was represented by the Quanzhenjiao 全真教 (Teaching of Complete Perfection). Louis Komjathy argues that the Quanzhen tradition merged with the Southern Lineage on the eve of the fall of the Song dynasty. It is very likely that the Quanzhen tradition also engaged the inner alchemical theories established by Wuzhen pian.",1075,1078,1378,936,Wanmeng Li,2021-07-21 20:52:22.315 +0200,2021-11-12 20:00:37.598 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1162,Lingbao dafa,43,Religious Group (v6),"Lingbao dafa 靈寶大法, the Great Rites of Numinous Treasure, also known as Duren dafa度人大法, the Great Rites of Salvation, is an aggregate of Daoist ritual practices. In the Daoist Canon, certain scriptures, such as the Great Rites of Shangqing Lingbao (Shangqing Lingbao dafa上清靈寶大法), classified into the Lingbao Daoist tradition have comprehensive descriptions and instructions for the practice. By using series of techniques like methods (fa 法), incantations (zhou 呪/咒), talisman (fu 符), and statements (shu 疏), it first applied to self-promotion to accommodate the body and mind with the Dao; and then, it was put to use in public ritual performance for universal salvation and expel demonic forces. 
The Lingbao dafa is a production of a combination of many new exorcisms and therapeutic methods in the Song-Yuan time (12th-14th century). Continuing the mediation practices in Shangqing 上清 [Supreme Purity] revelation, the Lingbao dafa used meditation techniques like visualization, concentration, and inner observation for the inner body promotion. The Shenxiao 神霄 [Divine Empyrean] tradition was borrowed by the Lingbao dafa in terms of its exorcism through the Thunder Rites (leifa 雷法). Attached to the view of deliverance in the Scripture on Salvation (Duren jing 度人經), it built on the traditional Daoist Retreat ritual (zhaiyi 齋儀) to formulate many salvation approaches, mainly practiced in the Yellow Register Retreat (Huanglu zhai 黃籙齋).In the Lingbao dafa, the most distinctive ritual performed in the Yellow Register Retreat is the Liturgy of Salvation of the Deceased through the Alchemical Refinement (liandu 鍊度儀). Because the Lingbao dafa featured in absorbing and transforming rituals from different branches of Daoism, Buddhism, and popular religions, it is hard for scholars to identify the exact relationship between the Lingbao dafa and other Song-Yuan new methods.
Although the movement of Lingbao Daoism appeared as early as the 4th century CE, the organized practice of Lingbao dafa was not formed until the 12th century. It was popularized in Southern Song China in the lower Yangzi River Basin, however, its spreading was not limited to Zhejiang 浙江, Jiangxi 江西, and Jiangsu 江蘇, but also as south as Guangdong 廣東. The Lingbao dafa, unlike many conservative religious ritual performances, was a very popular practice among both religious specialists and non-religious. All people without caring for their social, political, and economic background could be a practitioner of the Lingbao dafa, even when they still kept their other beliefs with them in Buddhism, Confucianism, local beliefs, etc. Ritual masters well known for their practice or compilation in the Lingbao dafa trace back to the Ning Quanzhen 寧全真 (1101-81, also known as Ning Benli寧本立), 王契真 (fl. ca. 1250), 金允中 (fl. 1224-1225), 林靈真 (1239-1303, also known as Lin Weifu 林偉夫) and so forth. Moreover, the Daoist master Lu Xiujing陸修靜 (406-477), due to his contribution in the composition of liturgical texts and normalization of early Daoist Retreat, his work on the early Lingbao tradition is a fundamental source when examining the Lingbao dafa. All in all, the Lingbao dafa was a medley of many new Song-Yuan Daoist methods; it witnessed the rapid growth of Daoism in the aspect of self-cultivation practice and public ritual service, thus, a valuable material concerning the Daoist ritual history.",400,1400,1307,969,Bingxia Bian,2021-07-27 05:47:53.940 +0200,2021-10-14 05:25:03.042 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1164,The Sanctuary of the Egyptian Gods at Gortyn,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"It was 1914 when G. Oliverio unearthed the first parts of the temple dedicated to the Egyptian deities. The entrance of the temple is west while at the south side there is a space with more constructions being part of the same complex. On the architrave above the entrance, an inscription reveals the name of the woman who, along with her two children, are the founders of this temple. 
The temple is small, with very simple architecture. On the inside of the cella, there is a podium accessible through its south side by three small steps. Four marble statues were found close to the podium, three of them had evidentially fallen off there. They are identified as the statues of Isis, Serapis, and Hermanubis while the fourth statue might be one of the donors. There is also a small staircase descending to an underground construction. The area was reused in the following centuries under different contexts as the excavator mentions the presence of tombs in the northern part of the temple one of which held an important number of byzantine coins.",100,300,1309,895,Dafni MaikidouPoutrino,2021-07-28 20:01:40.352 +0200,2021-08-06 18:18:12.305 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1170,Chongyang Lijiao Shiwu Lun 重陽立教十五論,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Chongyang lijiao shiwu lun (Fifteen Discourses by [Wang] Chongyang to Establish the Teachings, DZ 1233, abbr. Chongyang shiwu lun, Lijiao shiwu lun, or Shiwu lun) comprises fifteen short essays on the basic tenets of the Quanzhen order (Complete Perfection全真). Quanzhen is today the main official branch of Daoism in China, which originated in Northern China during the late twelfth century, under the Jin dynasty (1115-1234). It contributes significantly to the conceptualization of inner alchemy (Neidan 內丹), a system of doctrines and physical and spiritual practices to prolong life and pursue immortality, using alchemical terms that originally applied to making elixirs. The text has been held up as the representative expression of the early movement, and also serves as a manual for aspiring Quanzhen adepts and a general introduction to foundational Quanzhen religious praxis. As the title indicates, the text is attributed to the founder of Quanzhen, Wang Zhe (王喆1113-1170), who was known within the tradition as Wang Chongyang (Redoubled Yang 重陽), or by the honorific title, Chongyang Ancestral Master (Chongyang Zushi 重陽祖師). He composed a large number of poems related to inner alchemy, which laid the foundation of Quanzhen theory. After a long period of self-cultivation, Wang Zhe developed his own doctrine, traveled from his hometown of Shaanxi to Shandong, and accepted seven disciples, known as the Seven Perfected (Qizhen七真), each of whom established his or her own lineage. These seven would go on to form the early Quanzhen order. There is no evidence to prove that Wang Zhe himself created this text, but it clearly originated in the context of early Quanzhen and may have been composed by Wang or early generations disciples, maybe during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The Chongyang lijiao shiwu lun is divided into fifteen titles, which follow three main discursive areas: The first is the guidelines for the daily life of Daoists (1-6), who should build the temples and live there for group cultivation, travel in search of teachers and truth, study the classics and knowledge of medicine, practice with other Daoists. The second area is the practice of inner alchemy (neidan 内丹) (7-11). It describes specifically the method of meditation and encourages Daoists to practice Xingming shuangxiu性命雙修 (integrate cultivation of inner nature and life-endowment). In the spiritual sense, it requires the Daoist to keep the mind calm, to control their emotions, and to not be influenced by the environment. In the physical sense, it asks for the regulation of the energy in the body so as to prolong life. The third area is the theory of divine immortality of Quanzhen (12-15). Quanzhen practice does not pursues physical immortality, but rather spiritual immortality. However, while on this world, the body is still seen as the carrier of the spirit and therefore also requires cultivation. Through the bodily practices of neidan, Daoists can become immortal, and their spirit will transcend this mundane world to be united with the Great Way. On the whole, this text presents self- cultivation as the Quanzhen way of life, while explaining the religious worldview, spiritual orientation, and training regimens of the early Quanzhen movement. It has been widely studied and repeatedly translated as a manifesto of Quanzhen teaching, and it continues to occupy a central place in contemporary Quanzhen monastic communities.",1200,2021,1313,976,Wanrong Zhang,2021-08-07 19:47:17.571 +0200,2021-11-01 15:06:56.785 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1172,Twofold Mystery (Chongxuan 重玄),43,Religious Group (v6),"Chongxuan 重玄 (“Twofold Mystery”) is a Daoist teaching developed by early medieval Daoist monastics; the most prominent was Cheng Xuanying 成玄英 (fl. 631–655). The name Chongxuan derives from the fact that the Daoist thinkers, like Cheng Xuanying or Li Rong 李榮 (fl. after 650), used their commentaries to the Daode jing 道德經, and specifically to the expression xuanzhi you xuan玄之又玄 in the last sentence of the first chapter, to develop their own version of the four steps of continued negation (also called si ju 四句, or tetra lemma), which had become known in China predominantly with Buddhist Mādhyamika teachings, as an approach to realize Dao conceptually.// The earliest traces of Chongxuan thought can be found in writings and anecdotes from Daoists active at the courts of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-589 CE), it became popular in the early 7th century during the Sui 隋 (581-618 CE) and Tang 唐(618-907 CE) dynasties in the capital Chang’an. Furthermore, presumably because of individual monks travelling and spreading the new teaching, it spread also in Sichuan. Early 7th century Chang’an saw fierce competition and heated court debates between Buddhists and Daoists. Multi-level interactions between Buddhists and Daoists, from the reading of each other’s texts, to the participation in public debates, to the struggle for imperial support and patronage, was most probably the immediate background of the development the intellectual innovations of chongxuan teachings.// Interaction and competition between Buddhists and Daoists gained an important political dimension in the Tang dynasty due to the imperial clan’s claim that they, the Li 李 family, were descended from Laozi 老子, whose surname was also said to be Li 李. This claim was an opportunity for the advancement of Daoism, but it required that Laozi (associated in his divinized form with the Celestial Masters tradition dominant in the north) be the principal deity. This was potentially problematic because Daoism, as it was proposed by the clergy of the capital Chang’an, seems to have relied much on the southern tradition of the Three Caverns (a synthesis of the Shangqing 上清, Lingbao 靈寶,and Sanhuang 三皇 traditions), which considered the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement (Yuanshi Tianzun 元始天尊) to be the highest deity.// To resolve the clash between these two pantheons, Chongxuan theorists turned to the most distinctive feature of their teaching, the use of the logic of the tetra lemma (otherwise known as the four-fold negation from), which they had adapted from the Madhyamaka Buddhist tradition. Combining this mode of logic with the Two-Body theory (a Daoist adaptation of the Buddhist theory of the Three Bodies of the Buddha), Chongxuan theorists were able to argue for the logical interpenetration of the Dao, apparently separate deities, and the sage. In doing so, they redefined Laozi and the Heavenly Worthy as “response bodies” (yingshen 應身) of the Dao and thus unified the pantheon, making sure Laozi could be treated as the highest deity.// This interpenetration also enabled Chongxuan figures to transfer seemingly anthropomorphic characteristics, such as wisdom and compassion, to the ultimate entity of the Dao, which is inherently devoid of any specific characteristics. They thus defined the Dao as a compassionate entity that actively worked for the salvation of all beings and thereby responded to Buddhist critiques that Daoism did not offer the same type of soteriological benefits as Buddhism.// In fact, Chongxuan theorists developed a sophisticated soteriological model in which individuals could cultivate themselves and return to the Dao, thereby becoming immortal sages. Sages, moreover, were thought to deliberately return from the Dao to the mortal plane (much like a Buddhist Boddhisattva) in order to actively work for the salvation of all entities. They did so, it was thought, because they were motivated by the same type of compassion as the Dao.",500,700,1317,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-08-19 19:13:01.151 +0200,2022-03-14 22:57:18.398 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

As this is an ongoing project, our research is constantly increasing the general knowledge and information about Heliopolis, a major cult centre of Ancient Egypt. It is located in the modern suburb of Matariya northeast of Cairo. Heliopolis was active throughout the Pharaonic history of ancient Egypt, and dedicated in particular to the different manifestations of the solar gods, Khepri, Ra-Horakhty, and Atum, though there were also elements dedicated to aspects of Hathor and Osiris.

1174,Temple at Busayra,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Temple of Busayra is located in the foremost city of the Kingdom of Edom — Busayra. The temple is located atop the acropolis on a prominent mountain spur within the highlands of southern Jordan. This area was excavated by Crystal-M. Bennett between 1971–1974 and again in 1980.
There is some ambiguity in its identification as a temple, as very little material culture was found within the complex that would definitively identify its interpretation as such, a factor that was compounded by the nature of its excavation, poor preservation, and the length of time between its excavation and eventual publication. For this reason, while ultimately accepting a temple interpretation, the author of its final publication suggests that this interpretation must remain tentative (Bienkowski 2002: 94–95). 
Nonetheless, on the basis of its architectural form, this complex closely mirrors Temple Complex 650 at Tel Miqne and other comparable temple complexes of the late Iron Age. Likewise, its interpretation as a temple has been made more certain by the identification of the structures in adjacent Area C as a palace. This spatial layout at Busayra in the Kingdom of Edom then appears to follow a broader Iron Age Levantine pattern of large temple complexes adjacent palatial structures on the acropolis of capital cities, displaying the close association between political power and religious ideology.
There is no explicit data that can identify the deity of focus in the temple with certainty, though it can be hypothesized with a fair degree of certainty that the deity was Qos (and a consort?)

1175,Religion in Northern Hejaz,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the religions in the northern Hejaz and neighboring regions during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages and later (ca. 1500-300 BCE), the first time when there is firm archaeological and epigraphic evidence of local cultic practices. During this period the northern Hejaz shared strong economic and cultural links with the southern Negev and southern Transjordan, and the whole area can be considered a large ""cultural province."" The region is predominantely characterized by aridity and desert landscapes. As such, human habitation was traditionally based on nomadic pastoralism, while permanent settlements were restricted to the local oases, such as Qurayyah, Tayma and Dedan. The limited evidence of the local religions is restricted to archaeological and epigraphic data found in those oasis settlements and at the ""Midianite"" shrine at Timna Valley; rock inscriptions found in the desert; and the information provided by written sources external to the region, including Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian inscriptions and (problematic) biblical references. The local religions can be identified as polytheistic, although data is conspicuously absent regarding the existence of a pantheon of gods and about religious beliefs or sacred scriptures. The evidence of local deities is patchy and biased towards the epigraphic inscriptions of hegemonic oasis towns and external imperial powers. The earliest cultic practices are attested at the small Late Bronze shrine of Hathor at Timna Valley (14th-12th cent. BCE), where the cultic assemblage was interpreted as ""Midianite"" because of its cultural connections with the region of Midian in north-western Arabia. Biblical scholarship has seen in the biblical tradition of Moses' stay at Midian evidence of the Midianite worship of Yahweh, but the dating and interpretation of these texts are contested. At Tayma, a rectangular temple functioned during the early Iron Age (ca. 12th-10th cent. BCE), but it is not until king Nabonidus' stay at Tayma (553-543 BCE), when there is evidence of the worship of deities, particularly Babylonian Marduk and Zarpanitu. Local epigraphic inscriptions attest the introduction of the worship of Aramaean deities Salm, Asima and Sangila during the 5th cent. BCE, before and during the Lihyanite rule at Tayma. Several late Iron Age temples were excavated at Dedan, places where the local Dedanites worshipped gods such as Gadd and 'Ara'il; during the later Lihyanite period, deities included Dhu-Gabat, Ba'al-šamin, Han-'Uzzai and 'Aglibun.",-1500,-300,1320,997,Juan Manuel Tebes,2021-08-20 21:59:40.463 +0200,2021-08-27 00:29:40.558 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1176,Shijing 詩經 (Classic/Book of Odes/Songs),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Shijing 詩經 (Classic/Book of Odes/Songs) is the earliest Chinese poetry anthology, contains 305 odes from the early Western Zhou (eleventh century BC) to the middle of the Spring and Autumn period (sixth century BC). There are also six other sheng 笙 (reed pipe) odes listed in the table of contents with only titles. It has long been called Shi 詩 (Odes) or Shisanbai 詩三百 (Three Hundred Odes) until receiving the title of Shijing after its canonisation in the Western Han dynasty. After the canonisation, Shijing had long been a part of the study of Confucian classics instead of literature, for nearly two millennia until the end of the imperial era.

The Shijing is divided into four main sections: (1) guo/bangfeng 國/邦風 (airs of the states), xiaoya 小雅 (minor court hymns), daya 大雅 (major court hymns), and song 頌 (eulogies). Feng includes 160 odes from the 15 groups of the odes of the states. Ya 雅 includes 31 major and 74 minor odes of the states. Song includes 40 odes. Shijing’s prosodic pattern is dominantly (ca. 92%) a four-syllable line.

There is a close relationship between the Shijing and performance in early China. These odes served originally as word texts for chanting, performing with instruments, singing, and singing to the accompaniment of dancing. The differences in musical features are regarded as a base of the division of the sections. Feng has generally been defined as local airs, bearing musical features of various geographical regions. Ya was also defined as proper, the music of the central states. Song was music used exclusively for sacrificial offerings in ancestral temples.

A few of the odes include the names of the composers. Some pieces are attributed to historical figures, but most of the odes are anonymous. The content of the pieces included the voices from a variety of backgrounds, ranging across men and women, commoners and nobles, farmers and soldiers. The topics range from daily life (courtship, marriage, agriculture) to royal activities (battles, feasts, sacrifices).

There were two theories on how the odes were collected but neither of them is confirmed: (1) The Han dynasty historical record Hanshu 漢書 (History of Han) claims that the Zhou court had an office known as the caishi zhi guan 采詩之官 (ode collecting office), which was charged with collecting odes from various parts of the Zhou empire by recording odes sung by people. (2) The Guoyu 國語 (Discourses of the States) and the Liji 禮記 (Records of Rites) state that the officials and musicians presented odes (composed by themselves or collected from various places) to the court. Despite the theories, it is certain that the odes had gone through a process of polishing, arrangement, and editing therefore the current form is somewhat uniform in form and language.

During the early Han dynasty, there were three interpretative lines of filiations of Shijing study enjoyed positions at the Imperial Academy and imperial patron, namely Lu 魯, Qi 齊, and Han 韓. Another line of filiations, the Mao tradition received such status only briefly under Emperor Ping (r. 1 BC-6). There is no decisive evidence showing the differences between the lines, instead, the lines shared some common grounds: (1) attempted to assign individual odes, or group of odes, to specific historical circumstances; (2) attributed to the odes a secondary layer of meaning in the more spiritual realm of ethical and political philosophy. Despite the long period of being out of power, the Mao Shi 毛詩 and its attached daxu 大序 (major preface) and xiaoxu 小序 (minor preface) became the orthodox interpretation and recension of the text after Zheng Xuan 鄭玄 (127–200) wrote the Mao Shi zhuan jian 毛詩傳箋 (A Commentary on the Mao Shi). The Mao tradition eventually eclipsed all other three interpretative lines so that their interpretations and recensions of the Shijing have not survived except in fragments. The Qi tradition had died out during the third century and Lu the early fourth. The Han tradition has one work escaped from vanishing - Han Shi waizhuan 韓詩外傳 (Outer Commentary on Han Interpretative Line of Filiations to the Odes) - was no longer being taught at least before the sixth century. The recension and interpretative texts of the Mao tradition later became mandatory texts for imperial examinations. That is, the transmitted version of the Shijing after the Han dynasty became confined to a sole interpretative tradition: the Mao Shi. The transmitted Shijing was preserved only intact in the interpretative tradition of Mao. This was the only case where this happened amongst the Five Classics and the much later Wujing zhengyi 五經正義 (Corrected Meanings of Five Classics) compiled by Kong Yingda 孔穎達 (574–648) in Tang dynasty and Thirteen Classics (shisan jing 十三經) in Ming dynasty.

The following listed some major excavated manuscripts for the study of Shijing. The sequence arranged chronologically to the estimated date of texts:

(1) the Anhui University 安徽大學 obtained a collection of ancient manuscripts dated ca. 330 BC. Among the collection there is a set of written Shi, making it the earliest version of Shijing by now. The slips of the Anhui Shi manuscripts are all numbered consecutively at the tail of the front side of the slips, from 1 to 117. As 24 slips are missing today, a total of 93 slips remain, carrying 57 odes. All of the odes are from the guofeng, thus the Anhui Shi has slightly more than one-third of the 160 odes of the ‘Airs of the States’ of the transmitted Shijing. Anhui Shi demonstrated a geographical western bias of the states. Not one of the eastern states and only one of the central states of the transmitted guofeng is present in the Anhui Shi. The sequence order of the states also differs remarkably from the received Shijing. See Dirk Meyer and Adam C. Schwartz, The Songs of Royal Zhōu and Shào: Shī 詩 of the Ānhuī Warring States Manuscripts (Berlin: De Gruyter, forthcoming). 

(2) the Shanghai Museum acquired in Hong Kong a large collection of Warring States period (ca. 300 BC) texts written on bamboo strips. One work, titled “Kongzi Shi lun” 孔子詩論 (“Confucius’ Discussion of the Odes”) by the editors from the museum, contains what purports to be Confucius’ interpretation of certain Shijing pieces. The Shi lun is, for now, the earliest discussions of the odes which differ fundamentally from all other transmitted and excavated interpretations. See Ma Chengyuan 馬承源, ed., Shanghai bowuguan cang Zhanguo Chu zhushu 上海博物館藏戰國楚竹書 (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 2001).

(3) two versions of the “Ziyi” 緇衣 (“Black Robes”) text which has a number of Shijing citations. One from Guodian 郭店 (Hubei province) and dated ca. 300 BC, the other again in the Shanghai Museum. ""Ziyi” is a chapter of the transmitted Liji 禮記 (Records of Rites). The citations and interpretations from such manuscripts play a vital role in comparing them with the numerous citations of Shijing in early China. See Martin Kern, “The Odes in Excavated Manuscripts,” in Martin Kern, ed., Text and Ritual in Early China (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2005), 149-193.

(4) two versions of the “Wuxing” 五行 (“Five [Forms of] Conduct”) which has a number of Shijing citations. One from Guodian, the other with an elaborating commentary from Mawangdui 馬王堆 tomb no. three near Changsha 長沙 (Hunan province; tomb closed 168 BC). See Martin Kern, “The Odes in Excavated Manuscripts,” in Martin Kern, ed., Text and Ritual in Early China (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2005), 149-193.

(5) in a tomb at Shuanggudui 雙古堆 (Fuyang 阜陽, Anhui province; tomb closed 165 BC), 65 odes from the guofeng and 4 odes from xiaoya written on 170 wooden strips were discovered. The fragments contain many variants that cannot be found from the transmitted interpretative lines of filiations. This version of Shijing is important particularly for the study of interpretative lines as it is dated at the time that interpretative traditions were flourishing and started to secure their imperial positions. See Hu Pingsheng 胡平生 and Han Ziqiang 韓自強, eds., Fuyang Han jian Shijing yanjiu 阜陽漢簡詩經研究 (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1988).

(6) over 1200 broken bamboo slips of Shi were retrieved from the main burial chamber of the archaeological site of the Mausoleum of Marquis of Haihun (Haihunhou 海昏侯) near Nanchang 南昌 (Jiangxi province; tomb closed 59 BC). Compared to the findings listed above, the preservation condition of such a set is worse. The original sequence is lost and many characters are damaged. Given the extent of the damage, the arrangement of the slips is inevitably confined under the shadow of the transmitted Mao recension. Despite the adverse condition, the discovery is phenomenal for the study of Han interpretative traditions as the only recorded Shi teacher of the Marquis of Haihun was a teaching master of the Lu interpretative line of filiation. The Haihun Shi is thus being regarded as the first and complete recension of the long lost Lu Shi.

1178,Modern Mystery School (MMS),43,Religious Group (v6),"Modern Mystery School (MMS), formerly known as the Rocky Mountain Mystery School (RMMS), is variously described as a spiritual path, a spiritual business, and a spiritual lineage. It was founded in 1997 by Gudni Gudnason and is headquartered in Toronto and Tokyo. MMS emerged in Japan at the height of the ‘spirituality boom’ and the proliferation of spiritual therapeutic techniques that are often associated with the eclectic categories of Western esotericism or New Age. 
MMS teaches that there are seven Mystery Schools in the world where esoteric knowledge is transmitted in a continuous linage for thousands of years. While these Mystery Schools are closed and shrouded in secrecy, MMS advertises “no more secrets” and provides open initiation through an ascending spiritual syllabus. 

The course material is remarkably ecumenical, drawing from Kabbalah, Theosophy, Wicca, Mikkyo, Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity, ancient Egyptian cosmologies, Norse mythology, Tarot and Reiki (among others). Tibetan ritual objects (purbha) and concepts (Shambhala) are central to ritual practice and MMS eschatology, as are ritual swords based on knighthood from European classical antiquity. Workshops and seminars are offered at both MMS headquarters and in hundreds of spiritual salons (saron). 

Upon completion of one of seven initiatory steps (Adept, Healer, Ritual Master 1, 2, 2.5, and 3, culminating with Guide), initiates are awarded certifications and are empowered by MMS to practice and teach specific modalities. This system of spiritual credentialism, which allows students to become teachers (called Healers or Guides) who enlist their own paying clients, complicates traditional ideas of 'the religious' and blurs the distinction between belief and business. For more recent theorization of the exchanges of spirituality and materiality, see BBB under 'Online Sources'. There is an ongoing debate, playing out on social media, traditional print media, and various online forums, about the business model of MMS (see 'Online Sources' for a sample). 

MMS teachings are diverse and have flexible canonicity based on Mr. Gudnason revealing new modalities and making eschatological prophesies. There is no formal canon of scripture, although the Hermetica and Kabbalah are central. ‘The Cherubim’s Flames’ is a booklet of ritual incantations and mantras published by MMS and used by initiates. MMS primarily gives oral teachings, available in seminars, following in the tradition of the Mystery School for thousands of years, as described by Mr. Gudnason. Prominent teachings include both the universal realization of humanity’s oneness as Galactic Beings and the self-realization of our own individuality. 

Through guided workshops with a focus on aesthetics, self-branding and self-based leadership (Knowing Thyself), initiates (especially in Japan) are encouraged to increasingly individualize: to discover their unique “channeling contract” with a specific deity (the Channeling School is only available in Japan); to be given a personalized Ritual Master name by a lineage Ipsissimus during the 2nd-step Ritual Master initiation ceremony that speaks to their unique mission on Earth; and to “find joy” through reconnecting with sources of daily pleasure. Guides are encouraged to embrace the ""Royal Life"" by discovering their unique embodiment of divinity and their truest self-presentation. This can include beautifying interior designs of homes and spiritual salons, an overall material upgrade in the quality of life, and fashion makeovers (Mr. Gudnason practices “Sacred Dandyism”; Mrs. Gudnason has a fashion brand; and several Japanese Guides actively promote their physical self-transformation as an aspect of Being Royal through the NEW LIFE online magazine). Initiates are also encouraged to realize their cosmic significance as part of En-sof  (""The Divine Light"") in spreading Light, combating Darkness, and helping to usher in the future of balance, peace and harmony (Shambhala).

1180,Batak Traditional Religions,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry covers practitioners of the Batak Traditional Religion, a system of practices that has been typically referred to as a traditional belief (aliran kepercayaan) by the Indonesian government as opposed to a formally recognized religion (agama). However, the Batak traditional religion has gone through various local iterations, focused on the worship of royalty as god, millenarianism, modern reforms, and a re-application of an appeal toward traditional cultural understandings. The traditional Batak religion is also often described as a form of Hinduism that is heavily localized, specific to the ethnic context of the Batak people, or Batak Hinduism.",1600,2020,1325,520,William Noseworthy,2021-08-31 06:01:06.432 +0200,2021-08-31 06:02:14.458 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1181,Numinous Cliff Mountain Temple (Lingyan shan si 靈岩山寺),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Numinous Cliff Mountain Temple (Lingyan shan si 靈岩山寺) stands outside the city of Suzhou 蘇州, dominating the waterway that debouches into Lake Tai at Xukouzhen 胥口鎮. This mountain-top site was originally the location of a summer palace, the Guanwa gong 館娃宮 (Lodging Beauties Palace) constructed at vast expense for King Fuchai of Wu 吳王夫差 (r. 495-473 BCE) for his beloved favorite Xi Shi 西施. Xi Shi, one of the four great beauties of ancient China, was presented to the last king of Wu by his greatest enemy, King Goujian of Yue 越王勾踐 (r. 496-465 BCE), to seduce him to his doom. After the fall of Wu in 473 BCE, this great palace was destroyed. The history of the site is obscure until the Eastern Jin dynasty, when Lu Wan 陸玩 (278-341), a member of the distinguished Lu family of Wu Commandery, constructed the first Buddhist temple here. In the Liang dynasty (502-557), the Bodhisattva Zhiji 智積菩薩 (Sanskrit: Pratibhanakuta) is said to have manifested himself here to spread the Buddhist faith. In honor of this, numerous stupas were erected on this site from 503 onwards. In the early Song dynasty, the temple became a Chan Buddhist institution (having previously been a Luzong 律宗 temple), only to be temporarily rededicated as a popular religion foundation honoring Han Shizhong 韓世忠 (1090-1151) at the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty. Han Shizhong had played a key role in the founding of the Southern Song dynasty, as general in command at the battle of Huangtiandang 黃天蕩, during which he held off a massive assault by Jurchen forces for 48 days, allowing the Song court and countless refugees to cross the Yangtze River in safety. Even though the temple soon returned to Chan Buddhist worship, the name of the temple in the Southern Song dynasty still commemorated Han Shizhong, who is buried at the foot of the mountain. The Song dynasty also saw the construction of a magnificent pagoda at the temple. Numinous Cliff Mountain Temple underwent cycles of neglect and restoration throughout the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, only to suffer almost total destruction during the Taiping Rebellion of 1850-1864. The temple was subsequently rebuilt, but in 1926, it became a Pure Land Buddhist institution, and received its present name in 1932, as chosen by Master Yinguang 印光 (1861-1940). In 1966, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the monastic community was forced to leave, and the buildings were abandoned, but after 1976, restoration began. The temple has officially been active again since 1980 and continues to the present day. In 1990-1991, a program of restoration returned the Song pagoda to its original appearance, and the temple complex remains a popular pilgrimage site as well as receiving the occasional tourist.",-494,2021,1326,964,Olivia Milburn,2021-08-31 16:25:03.760 +0200,2022-02-18 09:00:05.427 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1182,Huainanzi 淮南子,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"(1) Huainanzi 淮南子 (lit. Masters of Huainan) is an encyclopaedic cosmological treatise dating from the early Western Han 漢 (205 BC–9 AD). The text was produced at the court of the kingdom of Huainan 淮南. The finer details of the text’s composition process, as well as the identity and role of a possible author, remain the subject of debate among scholars. The text was presented to Emperor Wu of Han 漢武帝 (r. 140–87 BC) in 139 BC by his own uncle and second king of Huainan, Liu An 劉安 (c. 179–122 BC), under the simple title of Neishu 内書 (Inner Writings). The occasion is described in Liu An’s official biographies in Sima Qian’s 司馬遷 (d. c. 86 BC) Shiji 史記 (Records of the Grand Historian) and Ban Gu’s 班固 (32–92) Hanshu 漢書 (Book of the Han), as well as in Gao You’s 高誘 (c. 168–212) preface to his commentary to Huainanzi.

(2) The Huainanzi comprises of twenty-one treatises (xun 訓), normally called “chapters”, each of which encapsulates a thematic body of knowledge. Their content ranges from proto-science, metaphysics, and cosmogony to the more practical milieus of military strategy, ritual practice, and statecraft. By Huainanzi’s own explicit claim in its postface “Yaolüe” 要略, its cycle of treatises synthesises, subsumes, and renders obsolete all other conceptual projects, past, present, and future, in order to formulate a perfect, complete articulation of the world. The ruler who digests this cosmological schema will master the fundamental workings of the realm and beyond, making Huainanzi the ultimate ruler’s manual.

(3) Many scholars have attempted to give full expression to the unitary nature of the cosmology put forth in Huainanzi. Michael Puett argues that it is a “phenomenology” that pushes the notion of “a monistic cosmos” to “the point when absolutely everything is seen as fully and inherently linked – not just seen as undifferentiated, but as even so linked that the very distinction of differentiated and undifferentiated is obliterated.” (“Violent Misreadings: The Hermeneutics of Cosmology in the Huainanzi,” Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities 72 [2000]: 40.) Benjamin Wallacker states that, in it, “[e]ach unique phenomenon is both part of and equal to the great unity of the cosmos.” (The Huai-nan-tzu, Book Eleven: Behavior, Culture, and the Cosmos [New Haven: American Oriental Society, 1962], 10.) It is my personal interpretation that Huainanzi’s diverse chapters are given to the formulation of a fractal cosmology, thereby achieving within limited text space a schema that is theoretically infinite in scope, application, and inter-connectedness.

(4) Four of the most crucial features of Huainanzi’s cosmology are “resonance” (ganying 感應, lit. “affecting and responding”), qi 氣 (vital breath, energy-matter), shen 神 (spirit, the numinous), and dao 道 (the Way). Resonance refers to the ability of separate entities to affect each other remotely, without any apparent transaction of physical force. The cosmic medium through which resonance is carried is qi; all forms, from the mythical to the mundane, are coalescences of qi. More rarefied coalescences of qi are associated with shen, a term that is variously used in reference to specific spirits and gods; to spirits and the supernatural in general; and to “the numinous” as a general, nebulous aspect pervading the world. Dao corresponds to reality at its most rarefied, referring to something like “ultimate reality” or “reality as it really is,” before and beyond the bewildering frenzy of qi coalescences. “Dao” also suggests the force that gives motion and direction to reality, with its frenzy of qi coalescences.

(5) Huainanzi’s cosmological model extends to the delimitation of moral and other norms. However, I would argue that these norms must always be understood as artefacts of the text’s overarching cosmological project. In other words, what norms are posited are done so as a reflection of their contextual application within this wider schema and their utility in its articulation, and must not be isolated from this precise context.

(6) Huainanzi’s ambitious claim to cosmological comprehensiveness has proved controversial on a number of interconnected fronts. First and foremost, scholars have not always been convinced that there is unity and consistency of thought across the text’s chapters. The present consensus is that the twenty-one chapters build upon one another, establishing the text as a conceptual whole through sequence, at least. The claim that Huainanzi might demonstrate a unity thought has sat uneasily alongside the text’s traditional affiliation of “miscellaneous” or “eclectic” (zajia 雜家), per the ideological categorisation rubric of the Han imperial librarians. This claim is also, in the view of some scholars, implicated in uncertainties regarding the identity/ies and number of the text’s author(s). Some scholars, moreover, have convincingly argued that any reconstruction of Huainanzi’s cosmology ought to be tempered by the wider political contexts of the text’s production, about which much remains tantalisingly uncertain. Contemporary Huainanzi scholarship unfortunately remains in a less advanced state than that of many other equivalent texts, and so many of these concerns are yet to be explored in-depth through the dialogues of multiple studies.

(7) Huainanzi had a notable impact on premodern thought in China. Throughout the premodern period, the text impacted proto-scientific thought from the natural philosophy of Wang Chong’s 王充 (27–100) Lunheng 論衡 (Discourses Balanced) to the Song 宋 (960–1279) encyclopaedia Taiping yulan 太平御覽 (Imperial overview of the Taiping period). The text was an important source within religious and philosophical Daoist discourse, with Liu An entering an evolving pantheon of Daoist “immortals” (xian 仙; see Ge Hong’s 葛洪 [283–343] hagiography “Huainan wang” 淮南王 in Shenxian zhuan 神仙傳 [Biographies of Deities and Immortals], Wenyuange siku quanshu 文淵 閣四庫全書 vol. 1059, 253–311 [Taipei: Taiwan shangwu yinshuguan, 1986], 284–5.) However, as far as is known, there is, either during the Han or shortly after, no organised religious group whose form or practices are directly associated with the text or take the text as scripture. Any database questions referring to religious groups should be understood in this context.

(8) During the modern period, Huainanzi has remained consistently understudied relative to other early texts. After a series of Japanese critical translations appeared in the 1910s and 1920s, there were no major developments for several decades, until translations and studies of individual chapters began to appear in Western languages from the late 1950s onwards. The first complete critical translation in a Western language was a French edition released in 2003 as part of the Collection Bibliothèque de la Pléiade.",-140,220,1327,1009,Corina Smith,2021-08-31 21:13:05.300 +0200,2022-01-26 22:18:05.467 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1183,Religion at Nippur in the Ur III period,43,Religious Group (v6),"Nippur was the unrivaled religious capital during the period dominated by the kings of the IIIrd dynasty centered at Ur in nowadays southern Iraq. As the city of the supreme god Enlil it can be considered as the ""Mesopotamian Vatican"" latest since the Akkad period (c. 2350 BC). The centrality of Nippur at the border between Akkad (North) and Sumer (South) might have triggered the factor of importance of the site. During Ur III times large scale construction programs at the East-mound of the site with the temple of Enlil as well as that of Inanna underlines the importance of Nippur during this period. As Ur III period is considered as a kind of ""Sumerian renaissance"" it was important for the state ideology to venerate the Old Sumerian gods. Probably building on an ancient custom, the kings of Ur were crowned to be kings of Sumer and Akkad at Nippur. 
Reconstructed with the help of the Puzrish-Dagan (modern Drehem) texts which were excavated illegally at a site nearby Nippur, the ritual calendar can be reconstructed. Each month a festival was celebrated which was often related to a specific god as, for example, the gu4-si-su (sum.) festival of the second month (c. April/May) which was dedicated to Enlils son Ninurta who was also known as, lugal gu4-si-su (sum.), ""king of the Gusisu"". One of the most important local religious celebrations was the festival at the nearby site of Tummal (modern Dlehim) with a boat procession to the ancient cultic center of Enlils wife Ninlil. Additionally, festivals related to agriculture like  the seeding (fourth month, sum. shu-numun) were also common. Other important gods at Nippur were the healing goddess Gula/Ninisina in the local form of Nintinuga (sum. ""Lady who revives the dead""). Her temple was probably localized by excavations at the northern West-mound.",-2100,-2000,1936,1012,Bernhard Schneider,2021-09-02 01:18:34.211 +0200,2023-04-24 11:46:08.917 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1185,Religion of Roman Palmyra,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Tadmor-Palmyra, an ancient city located in an oasis in the middle of Syrian dry steppe (commonly known as Syrian Desert), has a long occupation history from the Bronze Age to modern times. Double naming shows the city’s multicultural background. Tadmor is the original Aramaic name of the place, while Palmyra was used by Greeks and Romans. These two names are not exactly a translation. Pliny the Elder in his Historia Naturalis described Palmyra, that it was situated between two empires: Roman and Parthian and grew up on the rich soil. Being between two empires required great diplomatic skills, which the Palmyrenes mastered in their long distance trade, sending caravans to Spasinou-Charax, ships to India and Arabia, etc.
The trade and particular situation of Palmyra on the geopolitical arena, being long independent, resulted in urban development and the appearance of monumental architecture: columned streets, theater, monumental tombs (tower-tombs, hypogeas and funerary temples) and temples. Palmyra also had an advanced epigraphic culture. The city provides about 3000 inscriptions of different sorts: honorific, funerary, religious, etc. written mostly in the local dialect of Aramaic, but also many texts in Greek and only a few in Latin. The city provides an important material culture: epigraphical, iconographical and archaeological remains concerning the gods and their worship. About 40 divine names and titles are known through the written sources from Palmyra. Palmyrenes show themselves in the sources as multicultural society worshipping the deities of various origins: Mesopotamian, Phoenician, Aramaic, and Arabic. The divine protector of Palmyra was Bel, the Lord of Universe and Fate (of Mesopotamian origins), having the largest temple in the city, the ruins of which were destroyed in 2015 by terrorists. It hosted not only a temple devoted to Palmyrene gods, as it was labelled in the inscriptions, but later also a church and a mosque. The temenos was until 1930’ literally a house of Tadmoreans, where a modern village was located. Second in size, was the temple of Ba’alshamin, the storm god. Beside these two, there were also temples of the goddess Allat, of the god Nabu (or Nebo), of Arsu, of Belhammon and Manawat, of Rabbaseire, of Yarhibol, of Aglibol and Malakbel (so-called Sacred Garden) and of Atargatis. However, the latter was never discovered and is only attested in the inscriptions. In the Late Antiquity, Palmyra was a bishop's seat and had at least 6 churches.",-44,272,1363,1014,Aleksandra KubiakSchneider,2021-09-02 11:30:01.562 +0200,2023-03-02 02:11:02.814 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1186,Shrine at Horvat Qitmit,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The site of Horvat Qitmit is located in the semi-arid Beersheba-Arad valley of the northeastern Negev in the southern Levant. Dating from the 8th through the early 6th century BCE, this site was located within the southern geographic range of influence of the Kingdom of Judah to the north, based at Jerusalem. Nonetheless, the majority of the material culture from Horvat Qitmit shows strong parallels and similarity to that excavated in southern Transjordan, in the Kingdom of Edom. For this reason, Horvat Qitmit has often been called an “Edomite” shrine. In fact, recent research has demonstrated the cultural diversity of this northeastern Negev region that was located along a major east-west trade corridor that connected the Mediterranean Sea to Judah, Edom, and Arabia to the southeast. Due to these trade connections as well as the mobile agropastoral subsistence nature of the region, the “Edomite” material culture at Horvat Qitmit in fact represents persons established within, and local to the region. In addition to travelers and other mobile groups, this “Edomite” subset of the local populace frequented this shrine for generations. The primary deity worshipped at Horvat Qitmit was likely the deity Qos (קוס), as is attested in the inscriptions at the site. Qos is primarily known at this time as the foremost deity of Edom. There is evidence for at least one additional deity, a goddess (Astarte or Asherah?) attested in statuary, who may have been understood as the consort of the weather-type deity Qos. The site was eventually abandoned in the late 7th or more likely early 6th century BCE, at a time contemporary to the settlement collapse of this region that was in large part associated with the imperial Neo-Babylonian invasions of the southern Levant.",-800,-586,1342,842,Andrew Danielson,2021-09-03 01:08:02.590 +0200,2022-01-21 22:27:01.864 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1187,Sanctuary at Tell Damiyah,43,Religious Group (v6),"Tell Damiyah, a small settlement mound overlooking the confluence of the Jordan and Zerqa rivers, is the location of a late Iron Age building (ca. 700 BCE) with evidence for various Iron Age religious practices and artefacts. Hence, it was interpreted as a sanctuary. It is difficult to ascertain which deity/deities were worshipped here due to the lack of written data or and/or for example statues of deities. There is, however, potential evidence for the cult of Asherah/Astarte. Among religious objects encountered in and around the sanctuary building are anthropomorphic ceramic statues and both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines, and the building itself contained two separate altars/podia.
Exactly which Iron Age kingdom (e.g. Israel, Judah or Ammon), if any, Tell Damiyah belonged to remains ambiguous, although ceramic traditions from nearby contemporary sites such as Tell Deir 'Alla point to closer contact with the region of Ammon, rather than the areas west of the Jordan River.",-850,-700,1331,996,Diederik Halbertsma,2021-09-03 11:09:05.845 +0200,2021-09-06 10:41:33.831 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The site of its original location (a sanctuary) is unknown as the stele was looted and dumped on the side of the road in the area of Marmarini to the northeast of Larissa in Thessaly, Greece. The inscription details the rites and regulations for behaviour at the sanctuary in which the stele was erected. The inscription provides details concerning the sanctuary, as well as a festival to an unnamed goddess. The text provides information concerning a festival to an unnamed goddess, with other subsidiary deities such as Artemis Phylake. The cult described by the inscription seems to have had a lot of Near Eastern features (names of calendar months, proscription against pork, rituals from Near Eastern traditions, etc.).

1189,Yādiya/Sam'al,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kingdom of Yādiya, based at the city of Samʾal (modern Zincirli Höyük), was founded sometime in the 10th century BCE. Though the city’s history stretches back to the Early Bronze Age, it was destroyed during the Late Bronze Age and remained unoccupied until it was resettled at the foundation of the kingdom. The kingdom’s cultural practices are particularly notable for their combination of traditions otherwise known from so-called Aramean and Neo-Hittite polities. The kingdom also incorporated elements of Assyrian culture derived from interactions that began during the reign of Shalmenser III in the mid-9th century. Later, the kingdom became a vassal of Tiglath-Pileser III in the late 8th century. At the end of the same century, the kingdom was abolished incorporated into the Assyrian empire as a province.
Primary sources attest to a heterogeneous population in Yādiya. An early inscription describes two social groups (called mškbm and the bʿrrm) in a conflict that was resolved through the efforts of the king. The distinction between these groups remains unknown. While there is evidence for speech communities utilizing Semitic (particularly Samʾalian) and Indo-European languages (particularly Luwian), there is no direct evidence for these groups acknowledging ethnic or other social divisions between them. The royal family of Yādiya, for instance, primarily composed royal inscriptions in Semitic languages and sometimes took Semitic names, but Luwian names were somewhat more common. 
The pantheon of Yādiya may have been vast, and a broken inscription from the site makes mention of “the thousand gods,” making it the sole Iron Age polity known to have continued the Hittite tradition of referring to their pantheon in that way. More specifically, various kings are known to have been devoted to personal deities (such as King Gabbar’s tutelary deity Baʿal-Ṣemed), but the dynastic god was Rakib-El. Based on comparative evidence from the surrounding region, this dynastic god may have been a storm-god. Other storm-gods were worshipped as well, however, chief among them Hadad whose primary cult place may have been Gerçin. The Katumuwa inscription further mentions a Hadad of the Vineyards and a Hadad the Host as though they are separate deities, but the precise relationship between them is unknown. The same is true for Resheph and Arq-Resheph. Apart from these, the Yādiyans revered a mix of deities known from other Levantine and Mesopotamian sources, including the sun-god Shamash, the moon-god of Haran, and Baʿal-Ḥammon as well as the goddesses Kubaba and Nikkurawas. It is theorized that Kubaba may have been the consort of Rakib-El, but this is not confirmed by the epigraphic evidence. 
The best understood of Yādiya’s rituals were devoted to the royal family. These included but were not limited to mortuary feasts performed on a semi-regular basis. These were carried out in large ceremonial plazas on the acropolis, and in the royal necropolis at Gerçin. In the 8th century, such rituals were extended to non-royal elites as well and carried out in household contexts. Candidates for temples have not been extensively studied, so possible temple rituals remain mysterious.",-920,-713,1333,1015,Timothy Hogue,2021-09-04 20:20:29.308 +0200,2022-01-20 02:39:53.172 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1190,Ancient state of Urartu,43,Religious Group (v6),"Urartu developed from a series of small chiefdoms spread out on the Armenian Plateau, and had its capital established by Sarduri I on the Eastern shores of Lake Van during the mid 9th century BCE. From what today is the modern city of Van, the royal dynasty created by Sarduri ruled until the first half of the 6th century BCE. At one point the main antagonist of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Urartian territories stretched from Lake Sevan to the southern shore of Lake Urmia, and as far West as the sources of the Euphrates. Urartu’s core topography sets it apart from most states of the ancient Near East. Lake Van lies 1,680 m above sea level, and the mountains rise abruptly from the southern and western sides of the lake. This particular part of the Armenian Plateau is an area of intersecting mountain chains, characterised by the presence of depressions separated by highland areas. The result of this particular topography is a series of irregular pockets of land. The expansion of the Urartian state is characterised by the need to secure arable land and resources. Mostly known for their metalwork and their fortifications, Urartians had a well established religion with Haldi  at the head of the pantheon. Although most Urartian temples and inscriptions are dedicated to him, there are dozens of other gods mentioned in the texts.  Teisheba and Siuini, both wider spread in the Ancient Near East, are the most important deities after Haldi. Unfortunately, as with most archaeological datasets, our understanding of Urartu is limited. The belief system centred on Haldi is closely connected to the royal family and the elite, and we do not know to what degree it permeated the rest of the society.",-850,-580,1334,1011,Dan Socaciu,2021-09-07 18:31:16.394 +0200,2022-04-21 14:26:39.549 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1196,K’iche’ (Quiché),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the K’iche’ living in the town of Chichicastenango, Guatemala, around the time of 1930. The principal ethnographic authority, Bunzel (1952), indicated that at this time, Chichicastenango remained relatively isolated from intensive industrialization, European Colonialism, and Christianity. Although the arrival of European (primarily Spanish) colonists brought elements of Catholocism and political changes, the traditional K’iche’ cultural and religious beliefs and practices remained. Consequently, K’iche’ religious beliefs were somewhat syncretic, blending and incorporating aspects of Catholocism with traditional beliefs. Bunzel (1952:163) described that the Church and State are one in Chichicastenango, and “the problems of the individual soul, of life and death, sin and salvation, the relationship of man to the supernatural and to his own conscience are worked out through other institutions. The Church is primarily political--a state temple in which the rules and their surrogates discharge their religious obligations to the commonwealth.” In addition to church officials, the chuchqajau serves as a religious practitioner and specializes as a professional diviner, performing ceremonies for pay. These ceremonies occur during major turning points in life, such as baptism, marriage, and death. Other events in life have ceremonial aspects as well, such as building a house, planting and harvesting, and selling land. Ceremonies typically include a feast for the officiating individual and offerings to supernatural beings (Bunzel, 1952:84). Larger, communal ceremonies occur during fiestas, which mark significant holidays and are important to religious, social, and political aspects of K’iche’ culture. Because religion permeates all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with K’iche’ society itself.",1910,1940,1343,577,Emily Pitek,2021-09-20 17:03:19.237 +0200,2021-09-30 17:04:46.669 +0200,eHRAF
1197,Atheism in the Soviet Union,43,Religious Group (v6),"After the October Revolution of 1917 the Soviet Union was the first state which put atheism on its political agenda. An educational system and propaganda machinery were established to promote atheism in order to form the new, anti-religious Soviet man. Soviet Marxism was the ideology that intended to replace former religious beliefs such as Christian orthodoxy, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and Shamanism. The Soviet state followed the categorical imperative that the human world is based on scientific-rational facts and values and not on the belief in supranatural powers. Furthermore, the Communist party claimed to be the highest moral authority in the state and religion presented a threat. In daily life, the Bolsheviks were eager to replace religious rites and feasts by Communist. On the long run, Communism should be a substitute for religion. It was Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Communist Party who proclaimed that communism as an ideology and not religion refers to objective truth. In Soviet history there was a strong tendency to propagate the Communist ideology as religion. It has the messianic ambition to liberate the proletariat in Russia and elsewhere in the world from the yoke of capitalist exploitation. Contrary to religion, the new ideology promised a classless society based on equality. The Bolshevik concept of liberating the (world) proletariat and creating a future, classless world contained a quasi-religious, eschatological aspect. The Bolsheviks pursued the aim to destroy traditional religions. The high tide of atheism was immediately after the October Revolution and continued until the late 1930s when religious buildings were destroyed, priests, mullahs and other religious representatives were purged. During World War II, the repressions were released and in a wave of Soviet patriotism religion was upgraded. After the war until the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet state, despite its fundamental atheist character, sought for a coexistence with religion.",1917,1991,669,975,Eva Stolberg,2021-09-23 17:06:26.158 +0200,2021-11-08 11:26:44.880 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1198,Yazılıkaya Hittite Rock Sanctuary,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Yazılıkaya is an open-air Hittite rock sanctuary located near the Hittite capital Hattusa in central Anatolia. It was one of the most important monumental remnants of the Hittite empire. The sanctuary was built between a group of rock outcroppings, some reaching 12 meters in height, where one large and one smaller opening (Chambers A and B) served as its open-air halls. Excavations of the site revealed the existence of a multi-room building complex that once stood in front of the sanctuary and controlled access to its chambers. The site was in use from at least 1500 BCE, but gained particular significance after the carving of the reliefs in the thirteenth century. 

The main group of reliefs in Chamber A portrays sixty-three deities. The male deities on the left wall and the female deities on the right wall are depicted in separate processions, which lead to a central scene on the wall across from the entrance, where the two processions meet, headed by the two supreme deities of the Hittite pantheon, the Storm god and the Sun goddess. Most of the deities are accompanied by hieroglyphic labels, although many of these are illegible because of erosion. The labels identify the deities with their Hurrian rather than their Hittite names, which demonstrates the strong influence of Hurrian cultic traditions on the Hittite court in the thirteenth century. Thus the Storm god is labeled as Teššub and the Sun goddess is Hebat. Chamber A also has a well preserved 2.60-meter-high relief of Great King Tudhaliya IV.

The smaller Chamber B has fewer but better preserved reliefs, including another relief of King Tudhaliya IV, this time depicted in the embrace of his personal protective deity Sharruma. Both reliefs are accompanied by Tudhaliya's royal “cartouches.” Other reliefs of Chamber B are the 12 gods of the underworld shown in a procession and the 3.5-meter-high sword shaped relief of a somewhat mysterious Sword god, possibly representing Nergal or another underworld deity,

The specific function of the sanctuary is not securely determined, but Chamber A was likely a ritual site during periodic cultic festivals, while Chamber B probably served as a memorial or mausoleum for king Tudhaliya IV upon his death.",-1500,-1200,1344,1019,Tayfun Bilgin,2021-09-28 20:41:57.417 +0200,2023-04-22 03:38:11.526 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1199,Tiv,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Tiv are a group of people who have historically lived in what is now the Northern Provinces of Nigeria, along the Benue River. The first recorded contact between the Tiv and Europeans occurred in 1852, and the British began occupation in Tiv lands around 1906 (Bohannan, 1998). More consistent contact with the British started around 1911, at which time Dutch Reformed missionaries arrived, followed by Catholic missions in the 1920s and U.S. Protestants in the 1940s (Bohannan, 1998). More substantial changes to Tiv social and political structure as a result of the British administration occurred in 1934. This entry focuses on the Tiv living in the Benue Province of Ethiopia around the time of 1920. Although the Tiv had contact with missionaries, their influence was minimal and Tiv religion maintained its traditional practices.   According to the principal ethnographic authorities, Bohannan and Bohannan, “the total field of Tiv religion does not form a single, complete, or closed system of thought” (1953:81). Rather, several important concepts are associated with one another, such as tsav [ability/witchcraft potential], akombo [magical emblems and associated ritual], and mbatsav [individuals with tsav, who can utilize akombo]. No formal priesthood is present, but diviners are utilized, and mbatsav are capable of carrying out rituals.

The excavator, Anthi Batziou-Efstathiou originally interpreted it as a house but later proposed that the building was the city of Demetrias' official Metroon (sanctuary to the Mother of the Gods), which is supported by the royal stamps on its rooftiles.

1203,Book(s) of Daniel,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book(s) of Daniel depict a complex set of texts and traditions revolving around the figure Daniel, a Judean youth in the imperial courts following the Babylonian Exile (586 BCE). The earliest texts were composed in different languages (Aramaic, Greek, and Hebrew) and later preserved in distinct versions (Old Greek, Masoretic text, fragments from Qumran, and the Greek Theodotion). The texts also feature different genres, such as narrative court-tales set in the Babylonian, Median, and Persian imperial courts, as well as revelatory or apocalyptic visions. Based on the eight manuscript fragments discovered at Qumran and the prevalence of Danielic themes in the New Testament, it is clear that the book(s) of Daniel were widely circulated and had significant influence on early Jewish and Christian literature. Tropes such as the succession of empires and the everlasting dominion of the Most High (Dan. 2 and 7) would become central to later apocalyptic literature such as the book of Revelation, 4 Ezra, and 2 Baruch. 

Although the court tales have earlier origins likely in the Persian period, the first-person visionary accounts attributed to Daniel date to the persecutions of the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes (d. 164 BCE). It was also during this time period that the Aramaic and Hebrew traditions underwent their final redaction, culminating in what now resembles the Masoretic text. In the Greek traditions, there remain three additional court-like tales that are otherwise unattested. Although certainty on the matter cannot be established, linguistic features suggest that the tales may not have been originally composed in Greek but rather Hebrew or Aramaic. Each of the three tales—Bel and the Serpent, the tale of Susanna, and the Prayer of Azariah and the Hymn of the Three—relates to the character Daniel, some in more pronounced ways than others. Like the rest of Danielic literature, the date and provenance of these expanded tales are widely debated but they likely emerged during the second century BCE or earlier.",-586,100,1349,1024,Megan Remington,2021-10-04 17:19:32.734 +0200,2021-10-04 17:19:32.734 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1207,Female alchemy Tradition,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Female alchemy (nüdan 女丹) is a textual tradition of Daoist meditation and physiological exercises for women which emerged in China in the seventeenth century and developed throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  It is part and parcel of the much older inner alchemy (neidan 內丹) tradition, which advocates the possibility to achieve immortality through the progressive refinement of the body, aided by meditation, breathing, visualization, and massage exercises. This process has the aim of reversing the normal course of life that ends with old age, decay, and death, with a rejuvenation enacted through the transformation of bodily fluids into energy. This refined energy concentrates inside the body to form an embryo of immortality that is subsequently released through the top of the head. The neidan process had been formalised (within the Daoist tradition) for an un-gendered audience of practitioners as early as the Song (960–1279) dynasty. It involved three steps, the transformation of jing 精(seminal essence or essence) into qi 氣 , the trans- formation of qi into shen 神  (spirit), and the transformation of shen into xuwu 虛無  (nothingness). 
Until the emergence of nüdan in the late Ming and Qing dynasties, neidan was considered a genderless practice, available to men and women alike, though there was, for social and historical reasons, much less participation by women. In the Qing dynasty, this non-gendered process was adapted and applied to a specific female audience, and nüdan was born. The first individual nüdan texts started appearing at the end of the Ming dynasty, and the first full-fledged collections appeared in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is still practiced in China today. 
 These scriptures were often, but not always, transmitted through spirit writing at a lay Daoism altar from a god or goddess.
Differently from neidan, nüdan adapts its theory and practice specifically to the female body. Unlike a man, a woman needs first and foremost to refine her exterior form, her bloody and impure constitution, and her sexual characteristics. This attention to her exterior form directly relates to the structure of the female cosmological and physiological body that is yin and impure in nature. Blood (xue 血) is the central element of female physiology, and what needs to be transformed. The physical starting point for female practice is the qi cavity, a point between the breasts; through breast massage and visualisations, the blood that regularly descends from the qi cavity to the uterus, or sea of blood (xuehai 血海) in the form of menses, is sent upward in a backwards motion. in the traditional alchemical refinement triad jing-qi-shen, it stands in for the essence jing, resulting in a slightly different (female) triad, xue-qi-shen. 
Practitioners achieve the thinning and eventual disappearance of the menstrual flow, a process called Beheading of the Red Dragon (zhan chilong 斬赤龍). When this happens, other sexual characteristics change: the breasts shrink and the body becomes more androgynous. At this point, the woman has completed the first stage of the practice, the more gendered xue to qi. Once the female bloody constitution is transformed, and the gender and external sexual differences almost eliminated, the woman, having reached a state of pre-puberty or androgynity, can progress towards the final goal of immortality in the same way as the man.",1550,2021,1352,896,Elena Valussi,2021-10-07 22:51:39.412 +0200,2022-03-29 17:52:51.582 +0200,Mapping Religious Diversity in Modern Sichuan
1210,Mende,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mende have historically lived in Western Africa; this entry focuses on the Mende living in the vicinity of the town of Bo, Sierra Leone around the time of 1945. At this time, a section was the basic political unit and consisted of several towns and villages. A section chief held political leadership of each section, and a paramount chief led the chiefdom as a whole. Secret societies, namely the Poro and Sande, served crucial roles in transmitting social norms, rules of conduct, and performance of ritual activity. The secret societies held a close connection with certain spirits and rituals, and embodied supernatural power. The chief, although a secular figure, “acted as general patron of the more important secret societies, such as the Poro and the Sande, and was expected to sponsor the various ceremonies called for in connection with the ancestral cult and related forms of worship and propitiation” (Little, 1951:182). Supernatural beings, in addition to ancestral spirits, included non-human spirits, and a supreme high god who created the world but is said to not have an active role in the day-to-day life of humans.

1211,Religion in Samuha during the Hittite period,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Šamuḫa was an ancient cultic center and regional capital in the Hittite state. Thanks to recently excavated texts, Šamuḫa can be securely identified with an archaeological site near the village of Kayalıpınar on the Kızılırmak river, in Yıldızeli district, Sivas province, Turkey. Šamuḫa was occupied since at least the early Middle Bronze Age, and it was an important site in the Assyrian trade network. Šamuḫa was an administrative center in the border region during the reign of Telipinu (ca. 1500 BCE), and served as the de facto capital of the Hittite state during the reign of Tudḫaliya III (ca. 1370 BCE).
Unfortunately, we have very little information about religion in Šamuḫa prior to the Hittite period. Our knowledge of the local religious practices has increased dramatically since excavations began in Kayalıpınar in 2005. As throughout the Hittite state, their religion was polytheistic and pluralistic. Hittite texts frequently record multiple variants or local hypostases of an archetypal deity (e.g. the Storm-god of the city of Nerik). The Hittites revered anthropomorphic gods as well as natural features (such as rivers and mountains), and sometimes even divinized artificial objects. Deities worshipped in Šamuḫa came from Anatolian, Hurrian, Syrian and Mesopotamian cultural backgrounds, including divinities of local importance, major deities of the Hittite state (such as the Sun-goddess of Arinna), and gods adopted from foreign cultures.
The most important figures in the local pantheon of Šamuḫa were female deities. The original patron deity of the city was a goddess named Abara. During the Hittite Empire period (ca. 1350-1200 BCE) Abara was superseded in importance by the goddess Ištar, who was most often referred to by the Hurrian divine name Šawoška. One hypostasis of Ištar called the Goddess of the Night was brought to Šamuḫa from the region of Kizzuwatna (classical Cilicia), most likely during the reign of Tudḫaliya I (ca. 1400 BCE). The Goddess of the Night was closely associated with the Elamite goddess Pirinkir. Another important goddess in the city was Ištar of the Field of Šamuḫa. Ištar of Šamuḫa was the patron deity of the late Empire period king Ḫattušili III (ca. 1280 BCE).
The pantheon of Šamuḫa also included multiple hypostases of the Storm-god, such as Teššob of Šamuḫa, the Storm-god of Lightning, and Teššob of Aleppo, along with his consort Ḫebat of Aleppo. The recently discovered cultic inventory text KpT 1.36 mentions a previously unknown deity named the Glorious Sun-deity of the Field.",-1600,-1200,1356,1033,Timothy Leonard,2021-10-11 15:47:27.535 +0200,2021-10-18 17:41:10.752 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This placement was especially meaningful because it kept this god of craftsmen close to both the Industrial District and the commercial center. According to the Roman traveler Pausanias, Athena, goddess of craft, was worshiped alongside him and present in the cult statue. This Doric temple was built mostly of marble, and its sculptural decoration featuring a centauromachy (frieze) and the labors of the Athenian hero Theseus (metopes) emphasized the eastern end that was most visible to those in the Agora below. The Hephaisteion notably provides evidence of the landscaping of sanctuaries; planting pits and vessels dating to the third century BCE were excavated throughout the precinct.

1214,Temple at Tel Arad,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Temple of Tel Arad is located within the military fort of Arad in the semi-arid Beersheba-Arad valley of the northeastern Negev in the southern Levant. The site of Tel Arad itself was originally excavated by Yohanon Aharoni and Ruth Amiran from 1962–1967. A final report for these excavations was never published, though substantive preliminary reports were published by Herzog (2002) and Singer-Avitz (2002). As a result of early excavation methodology, subsequent building atop the site, and slow progress toward publication, the exact dating of the Temple has been contested. The temple was originally understood as in use from the 10th through the end of the 8th century BCE (Stratum XI–VIII), a period of 350 years (Herzog et al. 1984). However, a re-evaluation of the stratigraphy and material culture have clarified that it was only operational in Stratum X and IX, a period of 50 years spanning from the middle to the late 8th century BCE with its termination appearing to predate the invasion of Judah by the the Assyrian Empire under Sennacherib in 701 BCE (Herzog 2002: 14, 49–50). During the 8th century BCE this region and the fort of Tel Arad were under the sway of the Judahite administration based in Jerusalem. As such, and while we lack specific textual or inscriptional data dating to this period, we may postulate that certain features of Judahite religious practice as indicated within the Hebrew Bible were also present in the Temple at Tel Arad. Thus, it is more than likely that the deity of the focus in the Temple at Arad was Yahweh (and a consort?). The temple measures 12 by 18 m and comprised nearly one sixth of the available space within the fort, demonstrating its importance to those within. The temple presents a tripartite division with an outer courtyard containing a large altar of unhewn stones for animal sacrifices, a main hall (hêkāl) with its interior walls surrounded by stone benches, and an innermost sacred area (dĕbîr). Inside this room was a standing stone (maṣṣēbah) on a small platform. Incense altars from the site bear evidence of the burning of frankincense and cannabis (Arie et al. 2020). The Temple at Arad was decommissioned at the end of the 8th century BCE, with its ritual cancellation resulting in the removal of the majority of material culture from within it. The lack of destruction suggests it may not have been the target of a series of religious reforms (2 Kings 18) as was previously assumed (Herzog 2010). Nonetheless, subsequent the cancellation of the temple, the worship of Yahweh became increasingly centralized in Jerusalem.",-750,-705,1361,1039,Kristina Shishkova,2021-10-12 20:56:13.663 +0200,2021-12-16 02:10:31.278 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1216,Mawangdui (tombs),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Between 1972-1974, three elite Western Han 西漢 (202 BCE - 9 CE) burials were scientifically excavated at Mawangdui 馬王堆 (186-168 BCE), in the eastern suburbs of present-day Changsha, Hunan. Although tomb M2 had been looted several times in antiquity, tombs M1 and M3 had not been disturbed prior to excavation.  These two burials were exceptionally well-preserved, containing not only a wealth of finely crafted funerary items (M1 contained 1400 burial objects and M3 over 1600), but also more than forty manuscripts on silk, wood, and bamboo. 
 
Named Mawangdui, meaning “the mounds of King Ma,” the site was long thought to have been the burial complex of Ma Yin 馬殷 (852-930 CE), the king of the small state of Chu during the Five Dynasties 五代 period (907–960 CE). However, in the 1950s, archaeologists surveyed the site and dated the complex to the Han period, but it was not excavated until 1971, when workers, digging an air raid shelter for the local hospital, accidently disturbed tomb 1,  and realizing the importance of the find, the government sent a team of archaeologists and scientists, who were experts at handling perishable materials to excavate the site. 

The three burials were all vertical pit-style structures with multiple compartments.  In tombs M1 and M3, the outer coffin chamber 槨室 is divided into five compartments: the inner chamber 棺室, in which four nested coffins 棺 were located, and four additional spaces surrounding it.  The burial is oriented north to south, head to foot. 

     
Based on three jade seals, archaeologists have identified M2 as the burial of Li Cang 利蒼 (d. ca. 186 BCE), the chancellor of the kingdom of Changsha 長沙丞相, and ennobled as the marquis of Dai 軑侯 in 193 BCE.  


Tomb M1 contained the exceptionally well-preserved remains of a woman in her fifties, who is identified as Li Cang’s widow, Xin Zhui 辛追, also known as Lady Dai.  It also contained a large T-shaped silk banner, of a type not seen before, three unusually decorated inner coffins, well-preserved embroidered clothing, brilliantly colored lacquerware, food, and more than one hundred tomb figures. 

Tomb M3 contained the burial of a man in his thirties, and according to an inscription on a wooden board found in the outer coffin, the burial date was 168 BCE. The occupant is apperently the relative of Li Cang, possibly his son.  According to received texts, a son of Li Cang, Li Xi 利豨, succeeded him as the marquis of Dai.  Although these texts record that Li Xi died in 165, later than the sealing of M3, some scholars have argued that M3 was Li Xi's tomb.  Tomb M3 also contained a second funerary banner similar to the one in Tomb M1. The outer burial chamber was decorated with painted silk cloths depicting processions and boating expeditions. In addition to lacquerware and figurines, M3's furnishings also included musical instruments and weapons.  Of special interest to scholars, were three maps, at the time, the earliest found in China, and a library of texts, written in clerical script on silk. 
The images depicted on the nested coffins and the silk T-shaped silk banner, which was found laid over innermost coffin in tomb M1, apparently represents the tomb occupant on her post-mortem spirit journey, and were probably intended to assist and guide the deceased on this journey.  These tombs are especially important for our undersatnding of concepts about the afterlife in southern China in the early Western Han period.",-186,-168,1364,892,Benjamin Daniels,2021-10-16 02:48:12.438 +0200,2022-01-22 02:36:33.795 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1217,Sanctuary at Tell Qasile,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Tell Qasile is a Philistine peripheral site and religious sanctuary dating to the Iron Age, consisting of three superimposed temples which demonstrate the growth and transformation of the religious centre. Tell Qasile provides unparalleled insight into the development of Philistine ritual architecture from Iron I-IIA and unlike the Philistine pentapolis (Ashdod, Ashkelon, Tel Miqne-Ekron, Tell es-Safi/Gath and Gaza), the site of Tell Qasile is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. The earliest Philistine sanctuary comes from 1150-1100 BCE (Stratum XII) which places it amongst some of the earliest examples of Philistine sacral architecture available. The temples of Tell Qasile were integrated into the town plan, structure and surrounding buildings and were not isolated or free standing temple buildings.

The main temple phases of Tell Qasile are labelled as Temple 319, Temple 200 and Temple 131. 

The Philistines were a group of the Sea Peoples, arriving to the coast of Canaan in 1200 BCE following the Bronze Age Collapse. The Philistines brought with them foreign religious, ritual and dietary practices, most likely migrating from the wider Aegean, Cyprus, Anatolia and Italy. The archaeological site of Tell Qasile and its finds are located in the Eretz museum in Tel Aviv, Israel. Little is known about Philistine religion, religious practise and deities, with the vast majority of research and discussion historically originating from the Hebrew bible and discourse of biblical archaeology. The Philistine pantheon may have consisted of three important deities throughout their existence: an Aegean goddess (possibly Ptgyh), Ashera (a Canaanite goddess), Dagon, Baal (son of Dagon). These deities were most likely not worshipped at the same time or period, but rather underwent a cycle as the Philistine cities became entwined with their local surroundings. Archaeology indicates that Philistine ritual activities may have included communal and elite feasting, votive offerings, animal sacrifice and the burning of incense.",-1150,-586,1365,1006,Madaline Harris-Schober,2021-10-18 05:35:15.959 +0200,2021-10-29 05:33:09.961 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The name Yiguan Dao, meaning the Consistent Way, comes from a phrase by Confucius in the Analects, 4:15, “My way has been consistent 吾道一以貫之.” Yiguan Dao has demonstrated its effort to evangelize the sanjiao tradition, namely, Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, although it is usually poised as the ultimate inheritor of the Five Teachings/Religions (the sanjiao plus Christianity and Islam). 
The origin of Yiguan Dao can be traced back to Luo Jiao, a sectarian religion created by 
Luo Qing (1442-1527) during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), which in turn attributed its ancestry to Taiping Dao, a Daoist sect involved in the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans at the end of the Later Han dynasty (25—220). Luo Jiao later evolved into several sects, and one of them was Xiantian Dao, which was suppressed by the Qing government in the early 19th century. In the 1870’s, Xiantian Dao further split into several independent sects, one of which later developed into Yiguan Dao (originally named “mohou yizhujiao”—religion for final salvation).
The founding of Yiguan Dao with its modern look is generally attributed to Wang Jueyi (1821-1886), who extensively reformed its teachings and rituals in the late 19th century and who is venerated as the 15th patriarch of the tradition. Under the leadership of Zhang Tianran (1889-1947), its 18th patriarch, Yiguan Dao enjoyed rapid growth during the 1930s and 1940s and spread to many provinces of the country. With the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Yiguan Dao was proscribed an illegal secret society and heretical cult and was eradicated from society as part of the antireligious campaign. At the meantime, however, it grew steadily in Taiwan for decades in spite of the persecution of the Kuomingtang government, a policy that was not abolished until 1987.
Yiguan Dao embraces an eschatological and soteriological philosophy and presents itself as the only way to salvation. The highest deity worshipped by the followers of Yiguan Dao is called Wusheng Laomu, or the Eternal Venerable Mother, and its worship hall is usually highlighted by the statue of Maitreya Buddha flanked by the statues of the monk Ji Gong and Avalokitesvara (Guan Yin). According to the eschatology and soteriology of Yiguan Dao, human history is divided into three eras: Qingyang Qi or Green Yang Era, Hongyang Qi or Red Yang Era, and Baiyang Qi or White Yang Era. While Dipankara Buddha and Gautama Buddha presided over salvation in the Green Yang Era and the Red Yang Era, respectively, Maitreya Buddha presides over the third period of salvation, the White Yang Era (from 1912 onward).
Yiguan Dao practitioners regard the initiation ceremony, called Qiu Dao (seeking the Dao), as the most important ritual, which involves the ""offering of the Three Treasures""—the saving grace from the Eternal Venerable Mother. The initiation ceremony articulates the exclusiveness of the membership of Yiguan Dao and only through this ritual can a new member be accepted into the congregation. The members of Yiguan Dao maintain a clear self-identification and call each other Dao Qin (fellows of Dao).  
Yiguan Dao followers generally believe that the corruption of humanity and natural disasters are associated with the end of the White Yang Era, which ushers in a final salvation. Thus, they emphasize the cultivation of Dao as the opportunity for repentance and purification. This moralizing doctrine paves the way for what scholars have called the “confucianization” of Yiguan Dao, as is clearly seen in its guiding principle: “Respect Heaven and Earth, hold courtesy toward deities; be patriotic to nation and faithful in engagements, cultivate morality and uphold rites; be filial to parents, honor teachers and masters, be trustworthy to friends, be in harmony with neighbors; rectify evil and approach good; be clear with five cardinal relationships and eight virtues.” In recent years, Yiguan Dao increasingly draws on Confucian notions to recruit young followers, and the Classics-Recitation Movement (Dujing Yundong) that has swept Taiwan and mainland China in recent decades is largely attributable to the campaign of Yiguan Dao.",1870,2021,1366,989,Yong Chen,2021-10-19 19:07:58.911 +0200,2022-03-15 19:32:55.896 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1219,Chunqiu fanlu,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The text Chunqiu fanlu  is a compendium of Chinese ethical and political thought traditionally ascribed to a pivotal scholar from the Former Han dynasty (206 BCE – 9 CE), Dong Zhongshu (c. 195 to 115 BCE.). Dong Zhongshu was a leading exegete of the Gongyang Zhuan (Gongyang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals), an early Han commentary of the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu ). The Chinese tradition credits him with an important role in the formation of “Han Confucianism“ as the state ideology during the reign of Emperor Wu (140 – 134 BCE). But, this view is radically challenged by contemporary scholarship. This lengthy, rich and comprehensive work consisting of 82 chapters (pian), of which 79 have survived, has been commented upon in China throughout history as one of the most authoritative texts of Chinese ruism (Confucianism.) However, in terms of its authorship, dating and even in its textual preservation, the CQFL is a rather problematic text. While there is no certain answer on the question on what parts of the CQFL can be authentically traced to Dong Zhongshu, some chapters certainly originate from different sources. Most of the recent scholars agree that the CQFL is a collection of heterogeneous material from early Han and even post-Han scholarly work assembled by an anonymous compiler. The text contains a great diversity of subject matter. Sarah Queen and John Major persuasively argued that the text is arranged according to the principles that guided its anonymous compiler. They singled out five units. The first unit, Exegetical Principles“, consisting of the first seventeen chapters represents the earliest and most probably authentic part of the whole compilation. These chapters interpret the principles of the Spring and Autumn Annals based on the Gongyang commentary. The “Monarchical Principles” (chapters 18-22) focus on the techniques for maintaining the power and authority of the ruler.  They establish a kind of naturalistic approach which seeks normativity in the realm of nature. The third group, “Regulatory Principles” (chapters 23 to 28) addresses the regulations the ruler should observe after receiving the Mandate of Heaven. The “Ethical Principles” (chapters 29 to 42) group discusses the fundamental virtues and ideas esteemed by ruist scholars, such as humaneness ren 仁, righteousness yi義, wisdom zhi 智, virtue de 德, the rectification of names zheng ming 正名, and filial piety xiao孝. The “Yin-Yang Principles” group focuses on the cosmology of yin-yang and the four seasons in relation to the ruler’s emotions, actions, and policies. “Five-Phase Principles” chapters develop the art of rulership based on Five Phase wu xing cosmology. “Ritual Principles” group, constituted of twelve thematically linked chapters, describes various aspects of ritual obligations and sacrifice from the perspective of the Gongyang commentary on the Spring and Autumn. The “Heavenly Principles” (chapters 77 to 82) contain some rather corrupted chapters grouped around the idea of Heaven as the source of political and moral principles. They correlate the way of Heaven with the physical cultivation and governing the country.

1220,The Cult of Chinggis Khan (a.k.a. Genghis Khan) in Mongolia,43,Religious Group (v6),"After Chinggis Khan (a.k.a. Genghis Khan) died in 1227, an assortment of his belongings were enshrined in his wives’ palace tents (sg. ordo, pl. ordos, hence the English “horde”), and according to Mongolian tradition, became the locus of his continuing worship through the last eight centuries. The cult seems to have reached an apogee of power and importance in the 16-17th centuries, when Dayan Khan, a descendant of Qubilai Khan (a.k.a. Kublai Khan) and his house consolidated their rule. The tent shrines of Chinggis Khan was likely already a state shrine before this time, though the Great Khan did not necessarily control it (this is the “cult” referred to in the title, to be distinguished from the newfangled worship of Chinggis Khan and the Eternal Sky emerging across Inner Asia in the last three decades, about which Charleux, 2010, provides a great sketch). Simulacra of this cult still exist, at a colossal tourist attraction in the Ordos region of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region (IMAR) of China. There, to this day, hereditary shrine-custodians known as the Darkhad Mongols propitiate to Chinggis Khan, his family, and his banners. Although the turbulent 19th and 20th centuries saw repeated looting and destruction of the shrine’s texts and treasured material relics, the Darkhad families managed to preserve the ritual programs and prayers in textual compilations known as the Altan Bichig (which means “Golden Writings”).",1227,2023,1409,960,Dotno Pount,2021-10-20 13:36:58.444 +0200,2023-07-25 15:54:17.554 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1221,Temple at Tell Deir 'Alla,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Tell Deir 'Alla, a settlement mound in the Jordan Valley, is the location of a substantial Late Bronze Age temple (ca. 1550-1185 BCE). The site finds itself along two important trade routes: one running north-south and one east-west. The partially excavated temple yielded numerous impressive finds indicative of Canaanite religious practices, as well as of far-reaching international connections with for example Egypt and Mesopotamia. Moreover, it yielded numerous inscribed clay tablets which appear to contain a Northwest Semitic script. Built in an Egyptianizing architectural style, it consisted of a central 'cella' (or holy of holies), as well as numerous adjacent rooms containing both religious paraphernalia and everyday vessels.
While the exact deity (or deities) the temple was dedicated to, as well as what exact rituals were performed within it, remain unclear, it is clear the temple functioned as an important centre for the wider region.
While its construction can be dated to around 1550 BCE based on pottery shapes, its sudden destruction must be placed sometime after 1189 BCE, due to a terminus post quem provided by a faience vessel bearing the cartouche of Pharaoh Tawosret (1191–1189 BC).",-1550,-1185,1368,996,Diederik Halbertsma,2021-10-21 12:43:39.133 +0200,2021-10-25 11:22:07.816 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1223,Toda,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Toda historically inhabited the Nilgiri Mountains of southern India; this entry focuses around the time of 1900. At this time, the Toda had been in contact with Europeans, and India was under British rule. However, according to the principal ethnographic authority William Rivers (1906) European influence had minimal effect on Toda religious beliefs and activities. The Toda social structure included two endogamous divisions: the Teivaliol and Tartharol, each with several subdivisions (clans). Political leadership was maintained by the naim; a governing council composed of five individuals from various clans. The naim also held functions in connection with religious activities, deciding when ceremonies would take place and regulating the ti (sacred buffalo and accompanying dairies and grazing lands). As a pastoralist society, the Toda relied heavily on their cattle and dairies. The cattle played a significant role in the daily aspects of life (e.g., subsistence, economic), and also featured prominently in religious beliefs and practices. Certain buffalo are considered sacred and are associated with sacred dairies, ceremonies, and are tended to by dairymen-priests. Organized in a hierarchical manner, each level of dairy had its own grade of ritual and priesthood, with an increasing need for ritual purity and elaborateness of rituals for daily tasks. The ti comprises the most sacred level and is maintained by the palol (dairyman-priest, religious practitioner) who is selected from the Teivaliol division. The main types of Toda religious ceremonies are those associated with the dairy and those accompanying life-cycle events. Because the Toda religion permeates almost all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Toda society itself.",1885,1910,1370,577,Emily Pitek,2021-10-22 16:07:06.208 +0200,2021-11-10 17:02:22.068 +0100,eHRAF
1224,Duren jing,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Duren jing 度人經, the Scripture on Salvation, is an abbreviation for the longest text in Daoist scriptures: Lingbao wuliang duren shangpin miaojing 靈寶無量度人上品妙經, the Wonderous Scripture of the Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure on Limitless Salvation. The text consists of sixty-one chapters divided by its function from saving the country to individual affairs. What we see nowadays is an expansion of the original one-chapter version text, Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Yuanshi wuliang duren shangpin miaojing 太上洞玄靈寶元始無量度人上品妙經 (P. 2606), collected in Dunhuang Library Cave. This Dunhuang version of Duren jing is now considered as the earliest form of Duren jing in 4th-5th century. The title points out that first, the function of this text focus on salvation; second,  the text was instructed by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement (Yuanshi tianzun 元始天尊); and third, this text is miraculous and empowered by supernatural forces, thus become a wonderous scripture.
The structure throughout the text is identical. Each chapter starts with an introduction of the secret revelation and marvelous efficacy by reciting the text; then, there is the original scripture repeatedly shows up in the middle of every chapter; finally, the third part is the Innumerable Sound of the Secret Language of the Great Brahman [Energies] of the Heavens (Zhutian zhong dafan yinyu wuliang yin 諸天中大梵隱語無量音), a heavenly hidden language incomprehensible unless translated to the profane sound of human beings. 
The original text appeared first around 400 CE, after that, many Daoist priests commented, explained the secret knowledge revealed in the text. During the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song (r. 1100-1125), the Daoist master Lin Lingsu 林靈素of Divine Empyrean school (Shenxiao 神霄) led the program of enlarging the original one-chapter Duren jing to sixty-one chapters. However, neither the one-chapter nor sixty-one chapters version was the ancient text when it first appeared in the late 4th to early 5th century. 
Research on the Scripture on Salvation was an active project in Daoist Studies because, in the first place, it is the longest text among all the other Daoist scriptures, what contents in it is rich, as the description on Daoist cosmology, pantheon, rituals, etc. Besides, the text reflects strong influence by Buddhist salvation thought, the style of Buddhist sūtra, and the Sanskrit language. It provides a large number of resources for the study of Buddho-Daoist interaction. In the end, the usage of Duren jing in various Lingbao ritual performances would be great materials for examining the social-religious activities of medieval to modern Daoism.",400,500,1372,969,Bingxia Bian,2021-10-22 16:31:08.902 +0200,2022-01-27 13:46:41.689 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1226,Tainaron,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The site of Tainaron, situated on the southernmost point of the Greek mainland, was the location of a sanctuary to the god Poseidon from the Classical-Roman period. The sanctuary functioned as an important place of refuge and asylum in antiquity, for the enslaved and elite alike. Six inscriptions survive from the site that provide evidence for manumission of enslaved persons to the god Poseidon, and several texts attest to the role the sanctuary played as a safe haven for asylum-seekers. The archaeological remains visible on the site today include Hellenistic masonry (rebuilt into a Christian church of the Aghoi Asomatoi) on the promontory, as well as various building foundations and cuttings near the shore. Archaeological exploration has been limited, and so the foundation of the sanctuary is unknown; the earliest written evidence of the sanctuary to Poseidon dates to the 5th century BCE. Tainaron was also the location of the mythical entrance to the ancient Greek Underworld (Hades), a quarry-site for red and black marble, and the gathering place for mercenaries in the final quarter of the 4th century BCE.",-500,500,1375,1045,Chelsea Gardner,2021-10-25 16:27:40.358 +0200,2021-10-25 16:27:40.358 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1227,Polytheistic Pre-Islamic South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"Although the Bronze Age in ancient South Arabia (modern-day Yemen) is still poorly understood, there is a wealth of archaeological and epigraphic data for reconstructing the region’s history from the beginning of the first millennium BCE onward. While epigraphs in the Ancient South Arabian script may date as early as the 11th century BCE, texts useful to reconstructing South Arabian history and religion only truly begin to emerge from the 8th century BCE onward. These epigraphs attest to a plurality of peoples and city-states who worshipped a variety of gods. Most important among these are the four kingdoms, Saba, Maʿīn, Qataban, and Ḥaḍramawt, the former three which occupied the western highlands of Yemen while the latter was concentrated further east along Wadi Ḥaḍramawt. Each of these kingdoms had its own language (Sabaic, Minaic, Qatabanic, Ḥaḍramitic) and religion, which consisted in worship of the common high god ʿAthtar in addition to a kingdom’s own patron deity (Almaqah for Saba, Wadd for Maʿīn, ʿAmm for Qataban, and Sin for Ḥaḍramawt) and a national pantheon of lesser gods. 
	The influence of South Arabian religion was not restricted to modern-day Yemen. As early as 700 BCE, Sabaic epigraphs, gods, and religious architecture appear in northeast Africa. This eventually disappears in the second half of the first millennium BCE, a time during which other South Arabian kingdoms notably began to expand. Ḥaḍramawt then ventured eastward into modern-day Oman, where it founded a trading port at modern Khor Rori south of Salalah in the Dhofar. In the western South Arabian highlands, a new kingdom called Ḥimyar emerged. Over the next centuries, these Ḥimyarites would gradually increase their influence until they finally conquered all of South Arabia in the late third/early fourth century CE. Under their hegemony, state-sponsored polytheism continued until at least 360 CE, to which the latest known polytheistic text dates. Following this, South Arabia adopted a new monotheistic religion, resulting in the polytheistic gods disappearing from the epigraphic record.",-800,360,1376,1010,Jason Weimar,2021-10-25 23:23:33.389 +0200,2021-12-10 02:05:54.348 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1228,Lesu,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the people of Lesu (the name for both village and its inhabitants) around the time of 1930. The village of Lesu is located on the east coast of New Ireland, Papua New Guinea. At this time, the village was the largest social unit within New Ireland, and each village functioned independently. Within Lesu were 15 smaller hamlets, each containing two to eight houses. Cutting across local divisions were two exogamous moieties, the Hawk (Telenga) and the Eagle (Kongkong), which were each subdivided into several matrilineal clans. The clan was the primary economic unit and basis of political structure; important old men formed an informal council that held governing authority. 
	Overall, Lesu religion appears to have been based primarily upon magical beliefs and practices. Although a belief in the afterlife was present, previously human spirits were not particularly involved with the day-to-day life of humans. Ceremonial activity centered around life-cycle events (such as birth, initiation of boys, first menstruation of girls, marriage, and death) and include dances and feasts. Magicians served as religious practitioners, specializing in a particular type of magic such as love, medicine, or rain. Magicians were not involved in a formal priesthood but were instead individuals who were paid for their services and held associated prestige. According to Hortense Powdermaker (1933), the principal ethnographic authority, Lesu religious beliefs and practices are “not embodied in any one institution (such as a church), but [are] instead diffused throughout all of life, and is an attitude as well as behavior” (p. 306). Because religion permeates all aspects of society, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1915,1940,1377,577,Emily Pitek,2021-10-28 20:49:38.548 +0200,2021-11-10 18:08:25.208 +0100,eHRAF
1229,Three Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Three Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) is a politically oriented ""patriotic religious association"" that was established in the early 1950s by a group of diverse but prominent Protestants. The movement's name stems from its core principles of ""self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation."" Strictly speaking, the movement is not a church, but rather a collection of Protestant churches that are affiliated with the movement and who register with the state through the TSPM. The organization aims to represent Protestant believers in China and engage with the Chinese state on their behalf. To that end, TSPM maintains committees at not only the national level, but also the provincial, municipal, and county/district levels. The TSPM works in partnership with the China Christian Council, whose remit is to deal with doctrinal and pastoral issues, and, together, they are referred to as the ""Two Committees"" (lianghui 两会).
 
This entry understands the TSPM through the lens of several, TSPM-affiliated churches in the city of Huanghaicheng, a pseudonym for a city of approximately 2 million people on China's eastern seaboard. The research informing this entry is Mark McLeister's extensive ethnographic work in Huanghaicheng, which has been continuing since 2009. Because of this detailed focus, there may be slight variations between the answers to the questions presented here and other TSPM-affiliated churches in different parts of China.

TSPM-affiliated churches are distinguished by their belief in a threefold yet single God (made up of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit), who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, who created the world, and who is purely good. As well, members of TSPM-affiliated churches believe in an immortal soul that can be rewarded in Heaven or punished in Hell after death and that Jesus Christ is the messiah who will return at the end of the world to save the faithful and create a “New Heaven and New Earth” (xintianxindi 新天新地).

TSPM-affiliated churches understand the universe in terms of a three-fold division between that which is “of God” shuling 属灵 (and Jesus and the Holy Spirit), that which is related to Satan (sadan mogui 撒旦魔鬼) and “evil spirits” (xieling 邪灵), and that which is “of the flesh” (shu ruoti 属弱体) or “of the world” (shushi 属世). Individual sins and sinful acts act lead to a kind of break or opening (pokou 破口) in one’s spiritual life that can allow evil spirits to influence and even dominate one’s life. Evil spirits are also thought to be capable of possessing individuals or “playing tricks” (kaiwanxiao 开玩笑) on them such as by preventing keys from working in locks or hiding one’s keys. 
 
Previous scholarship has tended to present TSPM churches as staid and austere, befitting the organization's image as a modern religion, while discussing ""household churches"" as forms of ""popular Christianity"" that deal with more sensorially and aesthetically rich forms of religious experience in a way that echoes other popular religious practices in China. However, detailed ethnographic work demonstrates that these two religious modalities are present within TSPM, with the more formal aspect featured in weekly Sunday sermons and the latter aspect more prominent in small prayer meetings among church adherents throughout the week. The latter aspect is defined in terms of ling’en 灵恩. Composed of the characters meaning “spirit” and “grace,” this term is the same as that used in “charismatic” or “Pentecostal” movements. However, its adherents understand it as referring to distinct forms of practices unaffiliated with those movements. In brief, ling’en refers to being filled with (or moved by) the Holy Spirit as a result of prayer. It is defined in sensorial and aesthetic terms and is associated with feelings of joy and peace that can easily move a person to tears. The gifts given by the Holy Spirit can also include the ability to exorcize demons, heal the sick, utter prophetic words, and speak in tongues. Although not possessed uniformly by church leaders, ling’en qualities are an important measure of authority within TSPM-affiliated congregations. The atmosphere of the prayer meetings that are the frequent site of ling’en experiences form a strong contrast to the staid atmosphere of Sunday worship services and may be considered a more personal and sensorially rich form of worship than the “public face” of TSPM-affiliated churches presented in Sunday services. Nevertheless, participants emphasize that such prayer meetings are “warm” rather than “hot” (renao 热闹), as the term renao is thought to be associated with activities that are “of the world” rather than “of God,” and, in some cases, even with evil spirits. 

Protestantism is one of China’s fastest growing religious movements and the complex array of interactions between the leaders and participants of TSPM-affiliated churches and the state has many potential implications in Chinese society, especially in relation to issues of state-religion interaction, as well as the role of the law in state actions.",1950,2021,1132,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-10-29 18:46:14.645 +0200,2022-10-27 20:59:42.578 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1230,Cult at the Athenian Agora,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"An agora was a communal space found in most Greek cities that contained religious structures alongside those with commercial and civic functions, but it can also be thought of as a quasi-religious space in its own right. Specific points of religious focus within the Agora in Athens include, for example, the Altar of the Twelve Gods, a temple to Apollo Patroos, an altar to Aphrodite Ourania, the crossroads enclosure, and the Metroon. In addition, the Archon Basileus, the official in charge of religious festivals, had his headquarters in the Stoa Basileus; a calendar for sacrifices was inscribed on a wall there. Religion was embedded within the political institutions, so when governing bodies met in a building like the tholos or bouleterion there were ritual actions to start the meetings. Images of gods and heroes were present in herms and monuments like that to the Eponymous Heroes. The area as a whole was marked by horoi (boundary stones) and those who could pollute it were banned (e.g., murders), similar to other kinds of religious space. Although the political roles of the Athenian Agora began to wain in the Hellenistic period and were transformed by the Roman, it was still used for religion, as we can see by the importing of temples from elsewhere in Attica presumably for use in Imperial Cult there.",-600,276,1379,1016,Laura Gawlinski,2021-10-31 02:30:49.944 +0200,2021-10-31 02:36:35.175 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1231,"Shenxiao 神霄 (""Divine Empyrean"") Daoism",43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry follows the approach of the scholar, David Mozina by addressing Shenxiao Daoism from two angles: a 12th century textual lineage and a contemporary practice in Hunan that identifies with that lineage. It does so in the hope of illuminating aspects of both lineages. However, it is important to emphasize that this does not imply direct historical continuity, but simply highlights apparently similar threads within Daoism’s religious history. To further clarify these two angles, each comment is contextualized with a note regarding time period and three different time ranges are used: 1117-1127 for the initial florescence of Shenxiao in the Song dynasty, 1990-2022 for contemporary ritual practices, and 1117-2022 for answers that pertain to both time periods or to works of the textual lineage that persisted for centuries. It should be noted that the 1990-2022 time-frame corresponds to the period of ritual revival in Hunan following the Cultural Revolution, though the practices in question may date to as early as the mid-18th century.// Shenxiao 神霄 (""Divine Empyrean"") Daoism is a branch of Daoism that emerged suddenly in the early part of the 12th century in the Northern Song dynasty during the reign of Emperor Huizong 徽宗 (1100-1118 CE). The emperor himself is often revered as the founder of Shenxiao.// Shenxiao’s emergence was part of the rise of Thunder Rites (leifa 雷法), Daoist rituals that began to appear in the tenth century and that relied on Thunder Deities (leishen 雷神) to accomplish various goals such as rain-making and exorcism. It is these Thunder Rites that are still practiced in Hunan province.// A key feature of the Shenxiao cosmology is that, although it envisions a bureaucratic cosmos similar to other Daoist lineages, it places great emphasis on the oaths that deities make with one another and with human ritualists. This emphasis on cooperation as opposed to simply bureaucratic hierarchy suggests a greater sense of the subjective agency of both deities and humans than other branches of Daoism. This emphasis extends to the practice of Thunder Rites wherein Shenxiao practitioners make oaths with Thunder Deities and cultivate the primordial qi of their “spirits” (shen 神) through Inner Alchemy in order to establish equitable partnerships with the Thunder Deities that empower their rituals. //The court ritual master, Lin Lingsu, is credited with the innovation of synthesizing inner alchemical techniques (neidan) with the exorcistic power of Thunder Deities. In 1115, Huizong appointed the ritual master, Lin Lingsu as the court's highest-ranking Daoist. Lin Lingsu won this position by claiming that there was a 9th layer of the heavens (the Divine Empyrean) that was inhabited by deities superior to those of the other layers (which were understood as the sources of the teachings of other Daoist schools). Lin Lingsu further claimed that Huizong was the incarnation of the highest Shenxiao deity, the True King Jade Clarity, Great Emperor of Eternal Life (yuqing zhenwang changsheng dadi 神霄玉清真王長生大帝) who had taken earthly form in order to bring the Dao to all parts of the world. Lin Lingsu further claimed that a number of other court personages and intimates of Huizong were also reincarnations of Shenxiao deities and that he, Lin Lingsu, was the incarnation of a celestial officer tasked with propagating Shenxiao rituals and texts.// Although Lin Lingsu eventually fell from favour, Huizong created a network of Shenxiao temples (the Divine Empyrean Palace network) and declared himself True Lord of the Dao. He thus seems to have fully intended that Shenxiao become the imperial school of Daoism and a crucial part of his theocratic reign. This network was abolished after Huizong’s reign in 1127 but Shenxiao continued to flourish well into the Ming dynasty, particularly through the work of prominent theorists such as the patriarchs of the Southern School, Wang Wenqing 王文卿 (1093–1153) and Bai Yuchan 白玉蟾 (fl. 1194–1229?). While aspects of Shenxiao ritual continued to be patronized by imperial favour during the Ming, its identity as a distinct tradition both inside and outside the court had already combined with other lineage forms. Although Shenxiao eventually faded as a distinct school, its influence and ideas have continued to the present-day, including in exorcistic ritual traditions, as well as in the rituals of practicing Daoist ritualists in contemporary Hunan province, as documented by David Mozina and other, ongoing research in the region.",1100,2021,1248,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-11-03 20:32:30.180 +0100,2022-09-23 20:50:24.048 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1234,Ashanti,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ashanti are an Akan people and have historically lived in south-central Ghana. This entry focuses on the Ashanti living in Kumasi state around the time of 1900, and largely relies on information from the principal ethnographic authority Robert Rattray (1923, 1927, 1929). At this time the basic social unit was the family group (localized matrilineage); various family groups came together under the head of one particular family to form territorial divisions or clans. Additionally, each individual belonged to one of two patrilineal exogamous divisions related to the concept of notoro. Ntoro is one of the two great elements in every individual, with bogya (blood) the other. While ntoro is transmitted patrilineally, bogya is passed through the female line. The ntoro divisions inform practices such as taboo observances and ritual activity. Key features of Ashanti religion (at the time this entry focuses on) include various supernatural beings, ritual objects, practitioners, and ceremonies. The supreme high god is known as Nyame, God of the Sky, Supreme Being of the Universe. Nyame is generally viewed as far removed from the daily life of the Ashanti but delegates some powers to other beings. Additionally, lesser deities are known as abosom, and ancestral spirits are known as samanfo. Other minor spirits, powers of nature, and beings such as fairies (mmoatia) and forest monsters (sasabonsam) are present. Certain objects are of religious significance, including obosom and suman. An obosom is a non-human spirit’s resting place, a shrine, usually consisting of a brass pan or bowl containing objects. Human spirits (ancestral spirits) are believed to inhabit objects as well, namely blackened stools. These stools were anointed during ceremonies and received offerings and sacrifices. Suman is the term to describe objects such as charms, amulets, talismans, mascots, or fetishes, which are imbued with supernatural or magical powers. Specialized religious practitioners are known as okomfo (priests). These individuals experience contact with a deity, and subsequently, enter a period of training before becoming an official priest of that particular deity. A variety of rituals and ceremonies were practiced, many of which centered around the propitiation of specific deities or ancestral spirits (such as formal clan leaders or royalty). Because religion was important to nearly all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1880,1910,1382,577,Emily Pitek,2021-11-11 18:13:06.678 +0100,2021-11-24 23:37:26.790 +0100,eHRAF
1239,Book(s) of Esther,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Esther is part of the Writings (ketuvim) in the Hebrew Bible. It is a court drama that, in two of its earliest editions, details an etiology for Purim, a Jewish holiday which is celebrated on 14 Adar (usually sometime in February or March in the Gregorian calendar). 

In addition to the Hebrew text, there are also two early Greek versions, the Alpha Text (AT) and Old Greek (OG), which were written during the Second Temple Period. Both the AT and OG have later Greek additions, which are additional chapters that elaborate on the story. It is likely that the additions came from the same source, since they have so much in common. The Old Greek version of Esther and its additions are found in the Septuagint (LXX).

Most 2nd Temple scholars agree that Esther is a fictional tale. That being said, while nearly every character is fictionalized, and many of the inner workings of the Achaemenid court are fictionalized or exaggerated for the sake of hyperbole, Esther still can tell us about some of the cultural tensions present at the time of its composition. The story also provides us with a possible setting for the invention of the holiday of Purim: the Jewish Diaspora.

Esther is unique in that it is the only book in the Hebrew Bible that does not mention the Jewish god. The Greek versions of Esther resolve this by inserting God’s name into the text. The Greek additions to Esther even flesh out some of the ritual practices in the Hebrew text to include prayer. 

The Hebrew and Greek versions of Esther follow the same basic outline. The setting is the court of Susa, the capital of the Achaemenid Empire. The story begins with an extravagant banquet hosted by the king of Persia. The king becomes drunk, and asks that his queen be brought before the court. The queen refuses, and is removed from her position as queen and banished from the court. After this, the king must find a new queen—so all the young virgins of the land are brought to the court, one of whom is Esther, a Jewish girl. Esther had been living in Susa with Mordecai, her cousin and caretaker. Mordecai also plays a prominent role in the story due to his political rivalries. 

After entering the king’s palace, Esther wins the king’s favor and is soon made queen. There are political tensions between her cousin, Mordecai, and Haman, who is second in command of the entire kingdom. Haman creates a plot to kill all Jews in the kingdom. Mordecai informs Esther of the plot, and she tells the king at a banquet that she hosts for Haman and him. Haman is executed, and the Jews are given free rein to fight back against their adversaries. In all versions but the Greek Alpha Text, the holiday of Purim is established by an official decree to commemorate Esther saving her people.",-400,70,1386,1052,Marilyn Love,2021-11-22 23:32:47.830 +0100,2022-01-31 23:32:09.233 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1240,Azande,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Azande are a people who have historically inhabited Central Africa, covering parts of what is now South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. The Azande are composed of distinct ethnic groups united by language, culture, and political systems (Gilles, 1999). Sociopolitical organization historically centered around various kingdoms, each led by members of the noble (Avongara) clan. This entry focuses on the Yambio chiefdom (located in Yambio, South Sudan) around the time of 1905. This entry primarily utilizes information documented by Edward Evans Evans-Pritchard (the principal ethnographic authority), who conducted fieldwork in Sudan from 1926-1930. Although the Azande had come under colonial rule at this time, Evans-Pritchard (1937) documented traditional Azande customs and beliefs that had not been subject to significant English and Arabic influences. Each household held a shrine to ancestral spirits, which received offerings and prayers. Ancestor worship was largely a household matter with no associated formal priesthood. After death, human spirits would travel to caverns at the source of streams to reside with Mbori, the omnipotent but remote supreme high god. Mbori was not associated with a specific priesthood, shrines/temples, or set of rituals, but would be invoked occasionally. Mbori did not communicate directly with humans, but would instead communicate through ghosts. A belief in witchcraft played a prominent role in many aspects of life. Evans-Pritchard (1937:9) described witchcraft as a “psychic [non-physical] emanation from witchcraft-substance which is believed to cause injury to health and property.” Witch-doctors are those who possess the specialized knowledge and supernatural ability to diagnose and counteract witchcraft. Various types of oracles were also present and played an important role in Azande life. Oracles were consulted for a variety of matters, which they addressed through specialized knowledge, techniques, and supernatural ability. Azande magico-religious beliefs and practices permeate almost all aspects of life; consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1900,1935,1387,577,Emily Pitek,2021-11-24 16:26:59.919 +0100,2021-12-04 18:00:37.370 +0100,eHRAF
1241,Taiping 太平 Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864) was a Christian-inspired and cataclysmic millenarian uprising during the Qing dynasty that claimed the lives of between 20 to 40 million people. This entry takes a slightly broader view of the rebellion by examining the Taiping movement behind it from 1837 to 1866.// 
 
The Taiping movement can be said to have begun in 1837 when its founder, Hong Xiuquan 洪秀全 - a failed civil service examination candidate who belonged to the Hakka sub-ethnic minority in Guangdong - experienced a series of dreams in which he was taken to Heaven to meet the one true deity and emperor of China, the Heavenly Father. He was told that China had originally existed as a monotheistic utopia before Qinshi Huangdi and subsequent emperors had been seduced by Satan into worshipping heterodox traditions such as Buddhism and Daoism. The Heavenly Father further proclaimed Hong to be a ""Heavenly King"" (tianwang 天王) and charging him with restoring China to its utopian state as part of the transformation of the world into a new global order of Christian nations that would be united in their worship of the Heavenly Father and subordinate to China under Hong's rulership.//
 
Understanding himself as Jesus' younger brother, Hong began preaching his new message and was driven out of his village to Thistle Mountain in Guangxi. There he became the leader of a religious group called the God Worshippers. The majority of its members were of the Hakka sub-ethnic minority. Literally meaning ""guest people"" (kejia 客家), Hakka were Han Chinese people who had been pushed out of the north by invasion and faced frequent conflict with the earlier Han Chinese settlers of Guangdong and Guangxi, known as the Bendi 本地, who resented their intrusion and pushed them to marginal lands. Hakka people formed the core of the Taiping movement and many of their practices, such as monogamy, mutual dependence, and a resistance to foot-binding, became features of the Taiping movement as a whole.// 
 
Between 1848 and 1849, Hong Xiuquan was absent from the God Worshippers. During that time, several shamans and spirit mediums, most notably Yang Xiuqing 楊秀清, became prominent within the group and initiated practices in which Jesus and the Heavenly Father would descend into spirit mediums and perform miracles such as speaking in tongues or faith healing. Although hesitant to endorse these practices, Hong did so upon his return and Yang Xiuqing acquired a place of prominence within the group as the voice of God.// 
 
The descents of Jesus and the Heavenly Father also resulted in iconoclastic attacks by the God Worshippers on local temples and other religious sites on Thistle Mountain, which intensified tensions between the God Worshippers and Bendi militias, resulting in numerous battles. Alarmed by the God Worshippers' clashes with the Bendi, Hong's denouncement of corrupt officials, and the loyalty of the God Worshippers to a transcendent deity over the emperor, the Qing state attacked them as a rebel threat in the winter of 1850.// 
 
Shortly thereafter, at the beginning of 1851, Hong Xiuquan proclaimed the inauguration of the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace and Equality (Taiping Tianguo 太平天國) and launched an all out rebellion against the Qing. The God Worshippers, now better referred to as the Taipings, invaded the central Yangzi river valley and succeeded in capturing the former imperial capital of Nanjing in 1853.//
 
Hong proclaimed Nanjing to be the ""New Jerusalem"" and from it the Taiping movement created a theocratic state that, at its height in 1856, governed 30 million people. The Taipings were organized into specialty groups of 25 families that each provided a specific service for the state. Men and women, including spouses, lived separately and all property was held in common by the state through the institution of the Sacred Treasury. A particularly notable feature was the egalitarian treatment of men and women. Hong banned practices such as prostitution, concubinage, foot-binding, and widow suicide and insisted that women have equal access to the military, government service, education, and property ownership.//
 
Plans to reform the Taiping state into an even more utopian mode were cut short when, in 1856, Hong moved against Yang Xiuqing, who had come to refer to himself as ""holy"" and Hong as merely ""eminent."" Hong's attack on Yang Xiuqing resulted in the deaths of 20,000 people, ended the practice of mediumship, and fractured the Taiping movement, turning its commanders away from utopian visions and a united campaign against the Qing toward preserving their own regional power bases.//

Despite efforts by Hong Ren'gan 洪仁玕, appointed prime minister by Hong Xiuquan in 1859, to reform the Taiping state according to a Protestant vision Christian material civilization, Hong increasingly reverted to the Confucian style of government that he had previously renounced. As Hong increasingly withdrew from government affairs, Qing troops besieged Nanjing, cutting off its food supply and eventually taking the city in 1864. Hong died at the same time, possibly by suicide, and the rebellion was declared put down that same year. Imperial mop-up operations continued, however, until 1866.//
 
The Taiping movement's radical utopian vision and the devasting impact of its cataclysmic uprising left behind a complex legacy for late imperial and 20th-century China, foreshadowing and, in some instances, even helping to inspire the movements and uprisings of the 20th century.",1837,1866,1388,708,Matthew Hamm,2021-11-25 20:21:22.429 +0100,2022-04-14 20:37:57.612 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1243,Shengjing zhijie,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Shengjing zhijie 聖經直解 was authored by the Portuguese Jesuit Manuel Dias (junior) 陽瑪諾 (1574-1659). It was an extensive work containing 14 volumes with an additional booklet functioning as its table of contents. The first complete set was published between 1636 and 1642. Many more reprints were continuously produced throughout the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was a vital text considered as ""Holy Scripture"" or ""Sacred Classic"" by Christian communities in the absence of a Chinese Bible. Also, it was an essential source for non-Christian scholars to learn of Christian tradition and worldviews.
 
Today, these reprints are kept in libraries all over the world. This book is a translation of the Gospel readings from Mass arranged according to the liturgical calendar, accompanied with different forms of annotations and commentaries. The body of Shengjing zhijie the text itself with Gospel readings and commentaries of different forms consists of two parts: the Gospel readings are framed in a section named “jing” (經); long commentaries upon certain select verses containing exegesis and moral admonitions constitute another section named “zhen” (箴). The zhen section follows the jingsection. And interlinear annotations running through the jing section keep the Gospel readings accompanied. All the Gospel readings are arranged in the order of the liturgical calendar. Such construction is displayed in advance as Shengjing zhijie also includes paratextual elements. There are in total two tables of contents: one is a list of Sundays, “Shengjing zhijie zhounian zhuri zhi mulu” (聖經直解周歲主日之目錄), corresponding to the body part in volumes 1–8 ; the other lists major feast days including fixed and movable feast days in a liturgical year in “Shengjing zhijie zhounian zhuri zhi mulu” (聖經直解周歲瞻禮之目錄), corresponding to volumes 9–14. Both indicate where (which folio in which volume) to locate specific Gospel readings for specific days. Besides, there is another paratextual element is the index named “zashi zhi mulu” (雜事之目錄), literally meaning a table of miscellaneous matters. This is a carefully designed functional subject index displaying 144 major concepts and subject matters on Christianity that are elaborated on throughout this text.
 
Shengjing zhijie must have enjoyed a wide and thorough reception in a long time. Although no breakthrough study has yet to precisely pinpoint its readership, it is known that this text was brought up in different contexts. Moreover, at least four editions had been approved and produced in different places in China during different time periods. And, more than a dozen of copies survived until today even after the confiscation of Catholic books when Christianity was banned in the Qing dynasty. Beyond the textual history of Shengjing zhijie, an obvious textual network centering on this text also existed. For instance, because the Chinese translation of Gospel verses made available in Shengjing zhijie, a series of several Chinese liturgical texts directly took those passages, and a Chinese version of Missal and a Chinese text on meditation were among those texts. They did establish a foundation for biblical, liturgical, and practice texts in Chinese for Chinese Catholics, although none of them received authority from Rome.",1636,1900,1420,1061,Yanrong Chen,2021-11-29 08:30:48.248 +0100,2022-01-22 00:18:27.995 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1245,"Tabernacle, The",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Tabernacle (Heb. mishkan), also referred to as the Tent of Meeting (Heb. ’ohel mo‘ed), was an ancient cultic tent dedicated to the worship of Yahweh described in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical text, the Tabernacle facilitated the worship of Yahweh during the Israelite sojourn from Egypt down to the early monarchic period in the southern Levant. As a movable cultic tent, the Tabernacle is said to have been brought by the Israelites from Mt. Sinai, where Israel’s patron god Yahweh commanded its construction, through the ‘wilderness wanderings,’ into modern Israel/Palestine via the crossing of the Jordan River, until it finally came to rest at Shiloh (modern Tel Shiloh/Khirbet Seilun). Prior to the narration of its journey, the Tabernacle’s construction is described in detail in the book of Exodus (25-31 and 35-40). Based on this text, the dimensions of the Tabernacle are estimated to be about 30 cubits in length and 10 cubits in width. The rectangular Tabernacle tent was the central piece of a much larger sacred complex enclosed by a perimeter fence measuring about 100 cubits in length and 50 cubits in width. In the fenced courtyard area of the complex stood a sacrificial altar and a large basin for ritual washing, with the entrance to the Tabernacle nearby. The Tabernacle consisted of two rooms, an entrance room which housed the menorah (a seven branched lamp), the table of showbread, and the incense altar. The entrance room was separated from the innermost room, called the Holy of Holies, by a decorated veil. Inside the Holy of Holies stood the ark of the covenant, and in the biblical tradition, the Holy of Holies was the dwelling place of the glory of Yahweh. In spite of its important in the biblical narrative, many modern scholars view the Tabernacle as an invented or imagined cultic space rather than a real historical cultic tent. This is due, in part, to the elaborate and expensive materials needed for its construction, as described in the book of Exodus. In this view, the Tabernacle represents a fictionalized or idealized cultic space which has been retrojected into antiquity by much later group of writers during or after the Judean’s exile to Babylonia. There are many others, however, who argue for the historicity, however limited, of a cultic tent structure like the Tabernacle within the cultus of ancient Israel. In this view, the descriptions in Exodus may represent later embellishments, but the existence of analogous cultic tents from Near Eastern religious traditions, both contemporary to and predating the biblical tradition, suggests that the biblical Tabernacle is based on a historical reality. But whether real or imagined, the Tabernacle as presented in the Hebrew Bible represents the primary cultic site for the sacrificial cult of Yahweh prior to the construction of the Solomonic temple in Jerusalem.",-1200,-1000,1391,1013,Brian DonnellyLewis,2021-12-03 21:46:31.867 +0100,2021-12-08 21:14:46.437 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1246,Shilluk,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the Shilluk around the time of 1910. At the time this entry focuses on, the Shilluk lived along the banks of the White Nile, in what is now South Sudan. Groups of several households formed hamlets, which were each led by a chief. The chiefs were directly responsible to the king, who served as head of both political and religious affairs. Shilluk kings are said to possess the spirit Nyakang, the founder of the Shilluk and first king. Three major components of Shilluk religious beliefs are Juok (the supreme high god, an otiose creator deity), Nyakang and his incarnation through kings, and ancestor worship. Throughout Shilluk terrority are 10 cenotaphs “tombs” of Nyakang, which are regarded as the homes of Nyakang. Similar shrines to deceased kings are also present. The attendants and priests of the royal grave shrines and cenotaph shrines of Nyakang are referred to as the bareth. The bareth were responsible for maintaining the shrine, receiving sacrifices, and officiating in ceremonies. Two classes of medicine men are present, including the ajuago (the good medicine man, who works for the good of the community and cures the sick) and the jalyat (the evil medicine man, who practices black magic).

1247,Exovedate,43,Religious Group (v6),"Exovedate was the term coined for a provisional government that attempted a Catholic state in the District of Saskatchewan by Louis Riel. Similar to movements that other scholars might call NRMs (new religious movements) and other 19th century sectarian movements, the group represented a new Catholic group that had separated from communion with Rome, part of a larger movement headed by Riel over the course of a decade. The group disbanded after a few months, but their actions have had a lasting impact on Canadian history and culture.

Heavily influenced by ultramontanism and millenarianism, the group believed that Louis Riel was a prophet of God, and that the Catholic Church, namely the Roman papacy, was in decline. The belief was that God would soon show a dramatic sign, signaling the moving of the papacy so that it may be restored in Canada by the French-Canadians and the Métis. The papacy would move from Rome to Mount Royal in Montreal, Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec). Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal, was thought to be the rightful pope. It was prophecized that this papacy would also become corrupt over time, at which point the papacy would move to St. Vital in Manitoba, where it would stay. 

The Exovedate sought to bring back the Mosaic Law as the foundation of its legal code, redistribute the land claimed by the Canadian government to various immigrant groups, convert all Jewish people to Christianity, and protect humanity from the evils of 'liberalism.' They believed this was all a to be done as a prelude to the Second Advent, which was prophecized by Riel to occur in 4209C.E.

Group membership was known for certain to be a few dozen people, consisting of the government officials that made up the Exovedate and a few others close to Riel. The group died out after the North-West Rebellion in 1885, with the execution of its leader, Louis Riel.",1885,1885,1393,1066,Patrick Miller,2021-12-06 01:15:04.555 +0100,2021-12-16 08:13:54.781 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1248,Religion in the Old Assyrian Period,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Old Assyrian period refers to the earliest attested period of the city of Assur in the north of modern-day Iraq, later the cultural center of the regionally dominant Assyrian empire. In the opening centuries of the 2nd millennium, Assur was a single city-state ruled by a representative council, whose economic engine was long distance trade in tin and textiles to Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). The extreme profitability of the trade led several generations of Assyrian merchants to settle full-time in the Anatolian city of Kanesh, where they established a community referred to as the ""port"" with its own representative body to govern the local Assyrian community. 

The Old Assyrian pantheon was largely identical with that of the rest of Mesopotamia, with the exception of the chief god of the city. The city-god of Assur bore the same name as the city itself (modern scholars sometimes use ""Ashur"" for the god in order to distinguish the two, but the native writing was identical); for the Assyrians, Ashur was the chief god of the larger pantheon. The Ashur cult and its large temple environs were the center of polity life at Assur, which seems to have lacked a palace for most of the period. Second to the Ashur cult was that of the goddess Ishtar Assuritum, who also had a large temple complex at the city. Smaller temples of other important deities existed, and certainly myriad gods had shrines within the larger temple complexes. While naturally the Assyrian merchants did not have monumental temple complexes in their Anatolian host cities, the evidence makes clear that shrines to the many Assyrian gods were established at Kanesh and elsewhere, and some Assyrians served as priests in the ""port"". 

What we know of religion in the Old Assyrian period is heavily circumscribed by our evidence, which comes predominately from the massive textual and archaeological corpus left behind by the merchants at the site of ancient Kanesh, supplemented by some archaeological evidence from the hometown of Assur itself. Consequently, what is commonly called “Old Assyrian Religion” is above-all the lived religious experience of a group of one thousand or so individuals comprised of Assyrian merchants and their networks of relations. Furthermore, the great bulk of written evidence is from a 30-year window circa 1895-1865. Therefore, even though our window into “Old Assyrian Religion” is narrow and incomplete, it is near-unique for the ancient world in its intimacy.",-1972,-1718,1394,1070,Trey Nation,2021-12-07 19:03:27.129 +0100,2022-03-03 15:25:28.769 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1249,Cult of the Egyptian Gods at Demetrias,43,Religious Group (v6),"Demetrias was an important port city for the Macedonians and during the period of around 217-168 BCE, Demetrias grew as a commercial and political centre, with the port of Demetrias becoming very “international” with many peoples from around the Mediterranean world coming to Demetrias. Starting from the 3rd c. BCE Demetrias became the home to many Egyptian deities (such as Isis, Serapis, Anubis, and Harpokrates). Maria Stamatopoulou suggests worship of the Egyptian gods probably started as private among Egyptian migrants, or possibly Macedonian soldiers who had served in Egypt, but that worship became public during the 2nd century BCE. The worship of the Egyptian gods in Demetrias is known primarily from inscriptions and funerary stelae. No cult sites, however, have yet been identified archaeologically and it is still impossible to determine the material characteristics of their sacred spaces. A Serapeion is attested from an honorific inscription, although a location is still unknown. Apostolos Arvanitopoulos also identified a sanctuary to Harpokrates, but this identification is heavily debated. Sofia Kravaritou mentions that intermarriages between Egyptian and non-Egyptian inhabitants of Demetrias could have been a factor in the growth of the cult, as Hellenised Egyptian names can be found on Demetrian painted grave stelae. By the Roman period it appears that the cults of the Egyptian gods were firmly entrenched with the society of Demetrias.",-294,14,1395,1007,Adam Wiznura,2021-12-08 17:40:19.474 +0100,2021-12-08 17:41:00.802 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1250,Hanbalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Hanbalism is one of the four Sunni schools of Muslim law, and adherents to this school are often known as the Hanabila, Hanbalites, or Hanbalis.  Hanbalis are Muslim legal scholars or theologians who base their views about God and humankind on the teachings of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE). Ibn Hanbal is said to have memorized tens of thousands of reports attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, called hadith. These reports, along with the texts embodying the practice of Muhammad's companions, called Sunnah, re the sources for moral, social, and devotional life. Hanbalis reject any rational, speculative interpretation of God’s will through the Quran and the Sunnah. They interpret God's will and nature through rigid literal interpretation, and believe that God’s will can be known with certainty.  Hanbalis won over the hearts and minds of scholars and common people alike in early periods of their formation, resulting in a social and political movement. Some Hanbalis served in high government posts and judgeships, even at times of contention with ruling authorities. The movement began and thrived in Baghdad, Iraq for well over five centuries, with some spells of adversity by Shi'i rulers, and a movement of some Hanbalis to Palestine and Syria, where the movement enjoyed two centuries of flourishing. Their popularity in the premodern reached a pinnacle during the fourteenth century, a time when the school thrived as a result of the works of Ibn Taymiyya. Though Hanbalism is a legal school that trains scholars, non-scholars may consider themselves adherents to the teachings of the legal school by subscribing to the teaching of the school or implementing them in their own lives, such as for devotion and worship. The legacy of Hanbalism in the premodern period continues through the modern period, when the movement was adopted in part by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.",850,1350,1396,1030,Christopher Prejean,2021-12-09 11:27:25.412 +0100,2022-02-20 09:26:10.883 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

According to Junod (1927a), at the time this entry focuses on the Tsonga were composed of a number of clans, which formed six groups, including the Ronga. The primary social unit was the family and household. Several local households formed a village (led by a headman) and several villages formed a clan grouping (led by a chief). The central feature of Tsonga religion was ancestral spirits, known as shikwembu or ancestor-gods. Ancestor-gods were generally of two categories: those pertaining to the family and those pertaining to the country. The ancestor-gods of the chief’s lineage were those pertaining to the country. A formal priesthood was not present, but certain individuals (eldest male in a household/lineage) were responsible for leading religious activity and conducting ceremonies. The main feature of such ceremonies involved propitiation of the ancestor-gods through sacrifice and offerings. Other magico-religious practitioners included those who used magic for evil (baloyi), those who used magic for the good of the community (wizards), medicine men, and divination specialists. Religious beliefs and practices permeated many aspects of society; consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1880,1910,1397,577,Emily Pitek,2021-12-10 22:03:42.937 +0100,2021-12-16 16:36:54.023 +0100,eHRAF
1252,Shedachenglun 攝大乘論,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Mahāyānasamgraha is an important work of the Yogācāra school in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism. It was composed by Asaṅga and interpreted by Vasubandhu. In the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), Buddhaśānta (come to China in 511) translated this treatise into Chinese, in two fascicles. However, this translation does not include the commentary, so the profound meaning was not revealed manifestly and therefore it was not spread widely. In 546, the 1st year of the Datong大同 Era of Liang dynasty (502-557), Paramārtha (Zhendi真諦, 499-569) came from west India to China. At the request of Ouyang Wei欧阳頠 (498-563), the regional inspector (cishi 刺史) of Guangzhou, Paramārtha made a new Chinese translation with the help of Huikai (慧愷, 518-568) and Fatai (法泰,?-?). His version includes the translation of Shedachenglun攝大乘論 (Mahāyānasamgraha, also referred as Shelun攝論 for short), in 3 fascicles; Shedachenglun shiqin shi攝大乘論世親釋 (Vasubandhu’s Commentary for Mahāyānasamgraha), in 12 fascicles. Because of the spread of this treatise, the Buddhist School of Shedachenglun (Shelunxuepai攝論學派, Mahāyānasamgraha School) flourished in the Northern and Southern dynasties (420-589) of China. A group of masters are called “the masters of Shelun” (shelun shi攝論師), because of their reputation of learning and propagating Shedachenglun攝大乘論and Shedachenglun shiqin shi攝大乘論世親釋. They included Fazhun法准 (?-?), Daoni道尼 (?-?), Zhijiao智敫 (?-601), Huikai, Zhijiao, Daoni, Fatai, Caopi曹毗 (?-?), Sengzong僧宗 (?-?), Huikuang慧曠 (534-613), etc. Modern scholars believe that they, though lacking a definite academic lineage, can be considered as a Buddhist school. During the decline of Shedachenglun popularity (7th century) in August of 568, the 2nd year of Guangda光大 era of Chen Dynasty (557-589), Zhendi, along with other 11 monks swore to propagate Shedachenglun and Jushelun俱捨論 (Abhidharmakośa) in China. Daoni and Jingsong靖嵩 (537-614) spread Shedachenglun in the south while Tanqian曇遷 (542-607) developed the theory of Shedachenglun in the north of China with a great impact. However, after Jingsong and Tanqian, the popularity of Shedachenglun declined gradually. That is partly because Shedachenglun is based on the thought of Vasubandhu (around 4-5 century), whose study relates to consciousness-only theory in many aspects. Vasubandhu’s theory had been circulated and venerated widely in India. Xuanzang玄奘 (602-664) propagated Vasubandhu’s theory after he return from India, where he travelled and learned for many years. In his later years, he composed the Chengweishilun成唯識論 (Treatise on the Establishment of the Doctrine of Consciousness Only), which, taking six sutras (Mahāvaipulya buddhāvataṃsaka sūtra, Saṃdhi nirmocana sūtra, Lankāvatāra sūtra, Mahāyānābhidharma sūtra, Mahāyāna ghana vyūha sutra, and Rulai chuxian gongde zhuangyan jing如來出現功德莊嚴經[Sutra on the Virtue and Solemnity of the Tathāgata’s Presentation]) as the fundamental basis, is a mixture of Vasubandhu’s Weishi sanshi song唯識三十頌 (Triṃśikā vijñaptikārikā, Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only) and the commentary of ten masters such as Dharmapāla (530-561) and Citrabhāna (around 4 century). In this way, Shedachenglun was merely one of those treatises, but not the only one to be venerated. Besides, Xuanzang provided a new translation of Shedachenglun, which is far better than the old translation, because he checked the terms and facts synthetically in order to make the translation precise and trustworthy. In the study of consciousness-only school, the old interpretations from “masters of Shelun” lost its significance gradually; therefore, the School of Shedachenglun became a lost study and went extinct finally.",525,650,1398,991,Wenli Fan,2021-12-11 02:15:33.068 +0100,2022-05-25 21:47:45.446 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1253,Damascus Document,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Damascus Document is a rule text of the Judean religious group associated with the Dead Sea Scrolls (a group commonly, though debatably, identified as Essene). It first came to light in the early 20th century when Solomon Schechter published two medieval manuscripts (10th and 12th c. CE) from the genizah (manuscript storeroom) of a synagogue in Cairo. After fragments of ten more manuscripts of the same work were discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls from Khirbet Qumran, it became obvious that the document had originated among the members of that movement. Since the oldest copies from Qumran (4Q267 and 4Q266) date to the late 2nd and early 1st centuries BCE, it seems likely that the document was composed or redacted in the mid-2nd century by the larger sectarian group (possibly the Essenes) and was then brought to Qumran by the particular expression of the group that lived there. In consequence, the text displays a trajectory of editing from more universally applicable to more overtly sectarian. In terms of content, the text mainly contains religious laws, based in part on interpretations of the Jewish Torah, intended to guide the life and practice of the group's adherents. These laws are comprised of two strata—one that presents a legal vision for the nation of Israel as a whole and one that specifically regulates the practice of the sectarian community. Across these strata, the laws deal with a wide variety of matters including, inter alia, marriage and sex, ritual purity, oaths and vows, Sabbath observance, food taboos, theft, interaction with Gentiles, and communal organization. The document also frames these laws with significant portions of text devoted to justifying the legitimacy of the laws and exhorting the sect's current members to live by them. According to the text, the laws were divinely revealed to the sect’s founders several centuries after the Babylonian invasion of Judah (early 6th c. BCE) through the instrumentality of a founding teacher. The text presents the laws as true interpretations of the Torah of Moses and encourages members of the movement to take an oath of return to this Torah. As adherents to these laws, the text styles the community’s members as a unique group of faithful ones who hold fast to God’s covenant during the “Epoch of Wickedness,” a temporary period characterized by societal corruption under the influence of a supernatural figure known as Belial. The text contains promises of reward to those who persevere in the way of life presented in the laws as well as warnings of destruction for those who depart from it. The Damascus Document thus provides an important window into the history of the Dead Sea Scrolls sectarian community, the community's vision of religious law, and its members' understanding of their own epoch in light of the eschaton.",-200,50,1399,1038,Bryan Elliff,2021-12-13 21:00:48.659 +0100,2022-01-10 22:36:08.116 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1254,Stoudios Monastery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Stoudios monastery was established in the early 5th century, and has been occupied for much of its existence since then. The church that remains is the oldest in Istanbul. This entry largely deals with the middle period of its history: from Sabas' and then Theodore's appointment as abbot in Byzantium's Iconoclastic period during the late 8th century; through to the Ottoman seizure of the city in 1453. It was occupied by different groups before and after who were no less interesting, but are less well documented.

This was one of the most important and largest monasteries in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople from Theodore's appointment through to the 13th century Latin crusade. It was a crucial institution in its own right within the Christian Orthodox faith. Theodore of Stoudios was made the hegemonous or superior abbot over the akoimetoi monastery in the late 790s by Empress Eirene and the imperial court. Theodore's typikon, rule of monastic life, stressed the value and virtue in labour, literacy, and charitable activity. This template would be reused by some Greek monasteries and the bulk of Russian Orthodox monasteries up to today.

The monastery enjoyed financial patronage, and at times imperial favour. The Stoudites would remain an independent voice in ecumenical voice in ecumenical and imperial politics. They worked towards self sufficiency across their wide estates and related monasteries outside the city, while the Constantinoplian estates were positioned along the triumphal or parade route for emperors returning to the city and their palaces further east along the peninsula. The monastery housed relics which drew visitors and pilgrims, notably of St John the Baptist, as well as leaving a lasting impression in Medieval Greek scribal traditions.

What is visible today are the exterior walls and some of the floor mosaics of only the main church or kathlokion; and to some extent the cistern beneath. It is open to the elements, unoccupied, and unpreserved.

1255,Julian Romance,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The anonymous Christian Syriac work chronicling the life of Emperor Julian (d. 363 CE), known as Julian the Apostate for his attempt to revive traditional Roman religious practices in the final years of the Constantinian Dynasty. The Julian Romance is the apogee of a Late Antique tradition of Christian works antagonistic to Emperor Julian such as the Hymns against Julian of Ephrem Syrus and Orations 4 and 5 of Gregory of Nazianzus. While its extant recensions date back to at least the sixth century CE, the work potentially incorporates sources near contemporary to Julian’s reign. The text is likely an original Syriac composition and survives most extensively in ms. London, British Library Add. 14641 and ms. Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale Syr. 378. An early Arabic translation also survives in ms. Arabic 516 at St. Catherine’s Monastery in Mt. Sinai, Egypt. The genre of the work remains a matter of debate among scholars. Nineteenth-century German orientalist Theodor Nöldeke was the first western academic to publish a study of its extant manuscripts and to render its title as roman. Scholars in the later twentieth century such as M. van Esbroeck and J. H. Drijvers, however, have defined it as a work of hagiography and religious propaganda respectively. Itself a composite text and consisting of three main sections, the work covers: the ascension and apostasy of Julian; his persecution of the Christians, especially of Eusebius, the bishop of Rome; his eastern campaigns against Shapur II; his the divinely incurred and miraculous death; and the ascension of Jovian and his restoration of the Christian Empire. Although apocryphal, the Julian Romance was the most popular and influential account of the life of Emperor Julian in semitic literatures throughout Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Scholars such as G. J.  Reinink have demonstrated the influence of the work on Syriac apocalyptic texts, especially the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius. Accounts of the life of Julian drawn from the Julian Romance also appear in a number of Arabic universal chronicles including al-Ṭabarī, Agapius of Hieropolis, al-Masʿūdī, and Ibn al-Athīr.",361,599,1401,1071,Glenn Maur,2021-12-15 21:27:10.742 +0100,2021-12-17 04:12:55.890 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1257,Ammonite Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Centered on the region around the modern city of Amman, Jordan, the tribally organized, agropastoralist society of the Ammonites (literally, “the sons of Ammon”) flourished during the Iron Age II (ca. 1000–500 BCE), and especially in the latter half of this period. Like other aspects of its culture, Ammonite religion shares much in common with the other cultures of the ancient Levant (Judah, Israel, Aram, Phoenicia, Philistia, Moab, and Edom). These shared traits include a state god, a variety of other gods and goddesses, a special place for the ancestors, public and private cultic areas, and indicators of adaptations from regional peers and from the major political powers of the day located in Mesopotamia and Egypt. While Ammonite religion shares much with the surrounding cultures, there are also unique features. One distinguishing feature of Ammonite religion is the state/dynastic god Milkom, whose name is probably an epithet for the god ʾEl, and who appears to be represented in a tradition of stone sculptures that have been found in the vicinity of Amman. Also unique is the probable temple to the moon-god at Rujm al-Kursi, which most likely reflects a local tradition of lunar worship influenced by the iconography of the Mesopotamian moon-god Sîn.",-1000,-500,1403,994,Craig Tyson,2021-12-16 17:45:03.199 +0100,2022-06-02 18:51:12.511 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1258,Religion in Judah,43,Religious Group (v6),"The population of ancient Judah had, as their supreme god, YHWH. The earliest texts did not use vowels. When later texts did adopt vowels, the name of YHWH was considered too holy to vocalize. Through a misunderstanding of scribal practices, modern scholars misread the name as Yehowah/Jehovah. Today, scholarlly reconstruction normalizes the name as Yahweh, though there remains some minor doubt as to its accuracy.
The people of Judah (Judahites, sometimes referred to as Judeans/Judaeans, though this better represents the region under later Roman occupation) were predominantly highland people who derived from the broader ethnic category of ""Canaanites."" Pastoralism and highland agriculture (vineyards, olive orchards, some grains, etc.) were the norm. Being situated in the southern Levant (eastern Mediterranean seaboard), Judah occupied an ancient crossroads and often felt the pull and dominance of Egypt and/or Mesopotamia. Judah, as a polity, only gained a firm identity during a period when those greater political centres had directed their attention elsewhere. The highlands also afforded Judah some measure of protection as well as isolation.
The official religion of Judah was centred on the capital city, Jerusalem, where there was the official temple dedicated to YHWH. As with other ancient temples, this temple was also a site for royal administration, and may have supported the local scribal culture. Priests oversaw offerings, including both animal and vegetative offerings, and prophets proclaimed their messages publicly. Festivals were most likely linked originally to the agricultural calendar, though later they became attached to the cultural memory of certain events in Judah's past. 
Two of the thorniest issues in evaluating Judah's religion are Judah's identity vis-à-vis Israel and the actual religion of Judahites obscured by the ancient sources, namely the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh/Old Testament (hereafter HB).
The HB presents Judah as having been part of Israel from its founding ancestors. Our earliest non-biblical sources, however, display two neighbouring kingdoms, Judah and Israel, with Israel being the more powerful. Modern historians often doubt that Judah had been part of Israel, but instead had later assumed Israel's identity when the kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in the late 8th century BCE. The HB comes to us via Judah, though undoubtedly some of the material originated in Israel. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle Judah from Israel in reconstruction. Many of the religious aspects assigned to ""all Israel"" (including Judah in the HB) may not have been practiced in Judah. According to the HB, Israel and Judah had formed what is often called the ""United Monarchy"" under Saul, David, and then Solomon, with ""all Israel (including Judah)"" being ruled from Jerusalem. After Solomon (c. 930 BCE), the HB says that the kingdom of (all) Israel, split into two kingdoms: Israel in the north, with capitals that changed with dynastic changes, and Judah in the south, centred at Jerusalem and housing the dynastic line of David. Therefore, studies of Judah as a distinct identity is sometimes given dates as early as mid-11th century BCE if including the HB's ""all Israel,"" or beginning from c. 930 BCE, when the HB says Judah and Israel split. Others, relying primarily on archaeology, will begin meaningful discussion in the 9th century BCE when we begin to see more non-biblical attestations to the kingdom of Judah.
The second issue, regarding sanctioned religion, is also obscured by the HB. The texts we have are the largest source of information about Judah, but they were curated and edited heavily by scribes of a certain theological position. There is evidence of difference beneath the surface. Archaeology, even more so, shows a wide variety of religious practices either not described in the HB or condemned therein. Various other gods received worship (Asherah, Baal, El, et al.), and other religious officials presided over other religious shrines (not in Jerusalem). Household religion and ancestor worship also seem to have proliferated in Judah. Of these aspects, however, we have less information and scholarship is usually suggestive rather than certain.",-1000,-586,1404,1072,Kurtis Peters,2021-12-17 20:33:59.334 +0100,2021-12-17 20:44:44.945 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1259,"The LuWang School, the School of Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming",43,Religious Group (v6),"Lu-Wang Confucianism is a part of Neo-Confucianism from the Song dynasty (970-1279) and onward. The main protagonists were Lu Xiangshan 陸象山 (1139-1192) and Wang Yangming 王陽明 (1472-1529). They reacted against the view of Cheng Yi 程頤 (1033-1107) and Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130-1200), who shaped the so-called Cheng-Zhu Confucianism, a position which would become recognized as orthodox. Lu-Wang Confucianism is also called ""The School of Mind/Heart"" (Xinxue 心學 Learning of the Heart) and Cheng-Zhu Confucianism the ""School of Principle"" (Lixue 理學 Learning of the Principle). However, they are not isolated from each other. They manifested rather two different approaches in an ongoing debate. Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan met and were corresponding on philosophical matters. Lu Xiangshan is accused by the Cheng-Zhu Confucians for being a Chan Buddhist. It is his emphasis on spontaneity, criticism of textual and ritual rigidity, which lays behind such criticism. Such discrepancy is however found within the Buddhist tradition as well and even within Chan Buddhism. Therefore, this criticism does not give justice to the Lu-Wang current. It only reveals the vast span of Neo-Confucianism, their ideas, and praxis.",1200,1900,2149,908,Johanna Liden,2021-12-18 12:48:08.848 +0100,2023-12-06 20:49:38.887 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1260,Qiṣṣat Dhī al-Qarnayn,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Arabic Alexander Romance attributed to Abū ‘Abd al-Malik, which recounts the life and conquests of Alexander the Great. The work casts Alexander’s campaigns as a proselytizing mission bestowed upon him by God to bring monotheism to the most distant regions of the world. Part of the Western-Arabic Alexander tradition, the text is closely related to the Aljamiado Rrekontamiento del rrey Ališandre and the anonymous Ḥadīth Dhī al-Qarnayn edited by Garcia Gomez. As noted by Faustina Doufikar-Aerts, its extant isnads date much of  the text to the latter-half of the 9th century, although Z. David Zuwiyya demonstrates further additions up to the mid-13th century. The text is also noteworthy for its potential use of a lost work of al-Masʿūdī, the thirty-volume chronicle Akhbār al-zamān, as a major source. It has been edited and translated by Zuwiyya based on two extant manuscripts in Madrid: Real Academia de la Historia Colección Gayangos 61 and Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid ms. 5378. The narrative of the text is the result of centuries of syncretism between the broader Alexander Romance tradition and Islamic exegetical literature and Christo-Islamic universal chronicles. The phenomenon is attributable to Alexander’s early identification with the figure of Dhū al-Qarnayn in Qur’an 18:83-102, which is itself a retelling of the seventh-century Syriac Christian Alexander Legend as edited by E.A. Wallis Budge. The Qiṣṣat Dhī al-Qarnayn presents Alexander as a fully Islamicized prophet guided by the angel Zayāqīl (a corruption of Raphael) and whose campaigns are explicitly religious, instituting forced conversions to monotheism for all conquered peoples. After capturing the Persian empire of Darius III and the Indian kingdom of Porus, Alexander then moves on to mythological realms, converting people such as the Tārish who have the faces of dogs and the bodies of geese, etc. He eventually enters the Land of Darkness in search of the Fountain of Immortality but is forced to turn back. Upon his return, he does not die in Babylon, but in the Holy City of Jerusalem. Throughout the text, Alexander is also continually identified with Muhammad by presaging his accomplishments. For example, Alexander rides the flying al-Burāq, circles the Kaʿbah, and smashes the idols found within the temples of those he converts.",850,1250,1407,1071,Glenn Maur,2021-12-21 00:30:12.332 +0100,2021-12-21 03:27:25.715 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1261,Anyang,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Anyang is a modern municipal in northern Henan province of China. In the late 19th century, an accidental discovery of inscribed oracle bones at Anyang led to the beginning of the archaeological excavations in 1929.  Nearly-a-century archaeological discoveries and inscribed oracle bones confirm that Anyang was the location of the ancient ruin of Yin, dated to 14th - 11th century BCE. For more than 250 years, Anyang was a political and religious centre of Shang Kingdom (ca. 1600 - 1046 BCE), the earliest known state that controlled the lands of Yellow River and Yangtze River valleys. Divinations by processing turtle shells and ox bones and then application of incised texts onto shells and bones after divining had been a major state affair exclusive to royal houses and elites.  Shang people worship the Di or God literally in English, as a supernatural being, thus the Heavily Above. The Di, or Heavily Above, could be represented by deceased kings, thus ancestral worships, as tradition of Chines ritual since prehistoric periods, was a core of Shane’s ritual endeavours. Shang ritual process for state affairs from wars to marriage, have produced oracle bones as documentation.

	Archaeologically, Anyang is well known for its abundance of ritual bronze vessels, that can be viewed in major museums worldwide.

1263,Judean/Yehudite Colony at Elephantine (Persian period),43,Religious Group (v6),"Standard encyclopedic introductions to a religious community generally begin with information on the group’s name, origins, and overview of its membership. This information, however, is highly debated among experts. Therefore, the current introduction begins with the points on which scholars are broadly in agreement. During the fifth century BCE, on the island of Elephantine (an island in the Nile near Aswan) officials of the Persian Empire oversaw a multi-ethnic /multi-cultural colony which centered on a military garrison patrolling the empire’s southern border. In the early twentieth century several Aramaic papyri connected to this garrison were presented to British amateur archeologists by local Egyptians. Since then, many more documents—papyri and ostraca— have been brought to light either on antiquities markets or through excavation. Most of these documents belong to the fifth century BCE (Van der Toorn, Becoming Diaspora Jews, 3-8).  
	The Aramaic documents from Elephantine which include official and personal correspondence, administrative documents, contracts, as well as a copy of the Words of Ahiqar and an Aramaic version of the Behistun inscription, shed light on a diverse community. Within the documents one can find individuals and groups described by a wide-range of gentilic adjectives as well as references to Egyptian, Persian, and Syro-Canaanite deities. Among those personal and group descriptors are a number of references to “yhwdyn” (singular “yhwdy”). Some documents refer to the “yhwdy garrison in Elephantine.” Among the deities, there are references to “YHW,” the deity of the biblical Israel and Judah described in the Hebrew Bible (there spelled YHWH). The documents even indicate that there was a temple to YHW. How to properly describe this group of yhwdyn who worship YHW at his temple is a matter of debate.
	With respect to the group’s name, scholars translate yhwdyn variously as Judean, Yehudites, and Jews reflecting their positions on the group’s origins, ethnicity in the ancient world, and when Judaism (or, more broadly, religion) emerges as a category. Concerning the question of the group’s origins, the documents from Elephantine only hint at potential answers. Scholars generally recognize that the group came from the Levant, but precisely where they came from in that region, when they came to upper Egypt, and under what conditions is a matter of conjecture. 
Regarding the religion of the community at Elephantine, scholars again are left to piece together the evidence. One highly fragmentary document, TAD A4.1 or ""the Passover Papyrus"" seems to be concerned with timing around a festival. Some scholars have connected this to the Feast of Unleavened Bread and Passover despite neither being mentioned in the papyrus. Other documents reference a temple to YHW and sacrifices offered there. Some of these documents are addressed to the governor of Yehud. This raises questions about the centralization of the cult of YHWH in Jerusalem. Documents from Elephantine also reveal that the priests of the Egyptian god Khnum with the support of a certain Persian official destroyed the temple to YHW calling into question the harmony between various groups at Elephantine.",-500,-399,1411,1025,Julianna Smith,2022-01-05 17:22:03.800 +0100,2022-01-14 22:06:57.042 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1264,Judeans in Babylonia,43,Religious Group (v6),"The term ‘Judean’ refers to people with origins in the southern kingdom of Judah, which, along with the northern Israelite kingdom, occupied a strategic position between the imperial powers of Mesopotamia (Assyria, and later, Babylonia) and Egypt. Assyrian king Sennacherib (704-681 BCE) vanquished the northern kingdom, and deported the vast majority of Israel’s population throughout locales in Mesopotamia and North Syria. Although he also deported a significant portion of the Judean population, as illustrated in wall reliefs depicting the siege of Lachish and recorded in 2 Kgs 18:14-16, Sennacherib maintained Judah as a political identity, albeit as a vastly reduced vassal state. The scattered redistribution of deportee populations across the landscape complicates the identification and study of Israelites and Judeans in Assyrian sources, as the few distinctively Israelite or Judean names stand in geographic and social isolation from others of the same background; it is thus difficult to trace their history and/or social and economic location.
The documentary situation is different with the population of Judah, deported to Babylonia in several waves: in 597 BCE, following Nebuchadnezzar’s capture of Jerusalem, which resulted in the deportation of the 18-year-old king Jehoiachin and his family (2Kgs 24:12-16); in 587 BCE, after destruction of the Jerusalem Temple; and in 582 BCE. Unlike their Assyrian predecessors, Babylonian kings (primarily Nebuchadnezzar) resettled their deportees as largely intact groups and resettled them in single locales, in many cases, in new settlements named for their places of origin. Some deported Judeans were settled in a town called Yahudu (“Judah”). Cuneiform administrative texts (promissory notes, receipts, business ventures, lists, etc.) from Yahudu and nearby locales, preserve personal names containing the name of YHWH in their construction, marking those individuals’ Judean background. The Yahudu texts date from 572-477 BCE, and predate the archives of the entrepreneurial Murašû family (454-405 BCE), which also include evidence of participation of Judeans in the land-for-sector economy, a system by which the crown granted lands to individuals in exchange for performance of military service and/or payment of taxes. Judeans identified as royal merchants appear in a small number of business documents, as well as in a few documents attesting to their service in or proximate to the royal court. As all of the cuneiform sources recording a Judean presence in Babylonia belong to the economic and administrative sector, direct information that they provide on the religious experience of this deportee population is limited.",-598,-447,1412,1064,Laurie Pearce,2022-01-06 20:09:57.143 +0100,2022-11-08 23:44:09.621 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The Mozi 墨子, also known as Mojing 墨經, is an text traditionally attributed to thinker Mo Di 墨翟. Very little is known about Mo Di.

The current edition is however of 53 chapters; Johnston (The Mozi, page xxvii) suggests that 18 chapters were thus lost between the Han and the Song dynasties (i.e., between the second and thirteenth century CE), but Bi Yuan 畢沅 (1730-1797 CE) annotated in the Lushi chunqiu 呂氏春秋 that “the book of Mozi originally had 71 chapters, today 16 have been lost” (Lushi chunqiu jishi 呂氏春秋集釋 15.363, 2009 Zhonghua shoji edition), suggesting that perhaps two more chapters were lost after the 18th century. Of these 18 chapters, there is only a record of 8 titles. No content has survived.

Little has emerged from ancient manuscripts that may help recovering missing steps in the formation of this text. Decades after the recovery of Xinyang 信陽 bamboo manuscripts (1957), Li Xueqin 李學勤 identified a handful of them as the Mozi. This content is not part of the received Mozi that we see today; it was recorded in an edition circulating until the Tang dynasty, but was later lost. According to preliminary introductions, the Anda University collection of manuscripts also include some passages related to the text of the Mozi (Huang Dekuan 2017). This confirms previous suggestions that at least part of the Mozi was composed during the Warring States era (453-221BCE), with then additional textual material that became part of what today is the Mozi. None of the authors of this text’s sections can be identified. 
___
As noted in the scholarship (Johnston; Goldin), a peculiar feature of the textual history of the Mozi is its “disappearance” from the Qin dynasty (221 BCE - 206 BCE) onwards, until the text become widely available as part of the Daoist Canon 道藏, published in 1447. The records of commentaries are scarce, and the commentaries themselves have not been preserved (Johnston xxvii). Following this publication, it took another few centuries for Chinese scholars to rediscover this work. The major studies of the Mozi date to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911 CE). The current shape of the text is due to the work of the above mentioned Bi Yuan. Because of the secluded life of the text, it is very likely that the remaining 53 chapters correspond quite closely to what was catalogued during the Han dynasties. ___ The current structure of the Mozi is divided as follows: A) the Core Chapters, 1 to 7; B) the eleven “core” doctrines, from 8 to 39. each doctrine at some point included three sections (labeled as 上中下). Of these 33 chapters, 25 only survive. C) the canons, 經 (two chapters); D) the explanations 經說, 2 chapters; E) three chapters, two referred as “the choosing” chapters, 取, and one named Geng Zhu 耕柱; F) four chapters in the form of dialogues, 47 to 50; G) the remaining chapters, eleven in total. 
___
In terms of its content, the Mozi represents a set of ideas that are often considered to be a response to values later identified as Confucian. A central theme in the Mozi is that of “impartial caring” 兼愛, that is to say, the idea that individuals should care for each other impartially, regardless of one’s relationship to one another. Human are those who promote what is good for the world, not for oneself or one’s family (仁人之事者，必務求興天下之利，兼愛下). The figure of Mozi was attributed frugality perhaps in light of the text’s arguments against lavish uses of music (非樂 in 3 chapters, of which one has been preserved), and in favor to moderating funeral rituals (節葬, originally 3 chapters of which one has been preserved) and expenditure (節用, two of three chapters have been preserved). The arguments are developed from the same logic: if something does not benefit all society alike, then the way in which it is conducted must be changed. For example, extravagant funerals should be encouraged if they enriched the poor, gave abundance, corrected perils and governed chaos (厚葬久喪實可以富貧眾寡，定危治亂乎，此仁也，義也). Because this is not the case, those in charge should discourage it. ___ Heaven is also a critical topic, which is addressed primarily in three chapters titled “Heaven’s Will” 天志. Heaven is also referenced in other sections of this work, but one ought not haste to find a unified conception of Heaven or other subjects, given that the “Mozi” almost certainly is the result of multiple hands. As it happens with many other ancient texts, it is more appropriate to talk of common themes shared across multiple chapters. On the basis of these three chapters, Heaven can be summarized as an entity that desires what is right over what is wrong (“Heaven desires righteousness and abominates unrighteousness, 天欲義而惡不義” Legge’s translation); it sets standard for ruling and proper government, and cares for all people, 天之愛天下之百姓. Because Heaven is unavoidable, one ought to take what it desires and wants as model, and act accordingly: “The will of Heaven to me is like the compasses to the wheelwright and the square to the carpenter, 我有天志，譬若輪人之有規，匠人之有矩.” Because of this, Kirkland has defined the Mozi’s view of Heaven completely subservient to the socio-political philosophy of this text.",-400,200,467,586,Maddalena Poli,2022-01-07 22:02:22.097 +0100,2022-02-24 22:47:54.417 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1266,"The Baoshan Cemetery, Jingmen, Hubei Province",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"In ancient China burial grounds and cemeteries were not only place of veneration and commemoration, but also sites of ritualized communication and social interaction between the world of the living and the unseen realm. The Baoshan cemetery 包山 is located in present Jingmen 荊門, Hubei Province 湖北, formerly the heartland of the Chu Kingdom 楚 (ca. 1050-223 BCE). It is one of the best-preserved nuclear family burial grounds for Chu nobility. Its location, spatial layout, burial structure design, and entombed contents provide a rare glimpse into the material, religious, and social worlds of the aristocratic elite in the late Warring States period (ca. 4th-3rd centuries BCE) in southern China. 

The Baoshan cemetery was discovered during the mandatory archaeological survey in this area—known for its rich cultural deposits—prior to the construction of the Jing-Sha railway in 1986 and was scientifically excavated in 1987. The Baoshan cemetery is located on a ridge—a typical topographical feature of the rolling hilly lands in the region and prized burial location of high-ranking nobles of the Chu Kingdom—that is about 16 kilometers north of the archaeological site (Jinancheng 紀南城) of the capital city (Qi Ying  郢 ) of the Chu Kingdom roughly from 400 BCE to 278 BCE. 

The Baoshan cemetery consists of four tumular tombs (M1, M2, M4, and M5) that were dated to the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Archaeologists have identified these four tombs to be the resting place for a family of two generations headed by Shao Tuo 卲  (b. ca. 356 BCE), who, until his death in 316 BCE, was Minister on the Left (which seems to be primarily in charge of civil administration including maintaining social order and regulating economic affairs for both the nobility and common households) at the royal court of King Huai of Chu楚懷王 (r. 328-299 BCE). Shao Tuo was buried in the largest and the only intact tomb M2 at the cemetery. The other three tombs had unfortunately but unsurprisingly been looted since the antiquity and were poorly preserved at the time of the excavation. Immediate to the north of M2, in the slightly better preserved M4, archaeologists unearthed another male skeleton of 25-30 years of age at the time of the death and entombed weapons, often used as a gender marker for males. Based on the location and remaining entombed goods, the tomb occupant of M4 was believed to be a son of Shao Tuo. No skeletal remains were found in M1 and M5 and the identities of their occupants are inferred—wife of Shao Tuo and wife of Shao Tuo’s son respectively—based on the location of their tomb in relation to M2 and M4 and the remaining entombed goods, especially the absence of weapons. 

In contrast, Shao Tuo’s tomb (M2) was not only richly furnished but also remarkably preserved, attested by 1,935 pieces/sets of exquisite grave goods and three types of manuscript texts written in the distinct Chu script using brush and ink on bamboo slips, which provide the critical information on the identity of Shao Tuo, his lifeworld, and the anticipated afterlife of the elite like him. These invaluable bamboo manuscripts are among the best preserved and scientifically excavated corpuses dated to the 4th century BCE in China. They include selected administrative documents of the Chu royal court and local governments of seven years (323-317 BCE), Shao Tuo’s personal divination and sacrifice records of three years (318-316 BCE), and funerary inventory lists prepared for his burial in 316 BCE. According to the divination and sacrifice records, Shao Tuo was a fifth-generation royal descendant of King Zhao of Chu 楚昭王 (r. 515-489 BCE) and a member of the influential Shao (a.k.a., Zhao in the received sources) lineage whose immediate ancestors—great grandfather, grandfather, and his father—and himself served in various high-ranking positions for generations in the Chu Kingdom. 

The Baoshan cemetery was located in an area (i.e., within 25 kilometers radius) where large-scale tumular elite burials like that of Shao Tuo were abundant, clearly separating them from the cemeteries containing small to medium sized tombs that dotted around the immediate vicinity of the capital city site (i.e., within 5 kilometers radius). Baoshan M2 had a man-made earthen mound of a remaining height of 5.8 meters above the ground at the time of the excavation, which the locals nicknamed Baoshan, or “Bump Hill,” and after which the cemetery site was conventionally named by the archaeologists. Underneath the burial mound, a reverse-pyramid shaped earthen grave pit was dug with a broad upper opening (31.9x34.4m) and 14-steps gradually going down to the narrower bottom (7.8x6.85m) of the grave pit, 12.45 meters below the ground surface. Baoshan M2 had one tomb ramp of 19.8 meters long facing east. The earthen steps and the tomb ramp serve architectural and pragmatic functions of securing the wall of the large pit from collapsing during construction and transporting grave goods during the burial. However, scholars who follow the traditional ritual prescriptions recorded in the transmitted sources also contend that the number of steps and tomb ramps, which are not specifically stipulated in the ritual compendia, is an indicator of social status subjected to sanctuary rules. It is debatable whether idealized ritual prescriptions were followed, or to what degree sanctuary rules were practiced, however, what becomes clear as more tombs of similar scales like Baoshan M2 have come to light through archaeological work, they exhibit certain common architectural features and spatial designs, suggesting shared funerary traditions and conceptualizations of death and the afterlife among the high elite of the time.  

A box-like burial structure (waiguo 外槨 “outer casket”), measuring (W)6.26x(L)6.32x(H)3.1m, large enough to be a good sized room, was built using 102 pieces of large and small timber logs inside a smaller earthen pit dug at the bottom of the larger grave pit. This burial structure was divided into five compartments, with the middle one containing the coffins of the deceased minister and the surrounding four compartments filled with objects that had been used in his life and things that were prepared for the afterlife, for example, the administrative documents from his office and blank bamboo slips as well as writing instruments, the latter of which are best understood to be for his continuous use in the afterlife. 

Shao Tuo’s burial was richly provisioned. It is especially worth noting the groupings of entombed objects in different compartments and how the interred funerary lists shed light on the design of the burial space that helps us gain unprecedented understanding of how death and the afterlife were spatialized and conceptualized by the elite like Shao Tuo of the time. Take the eastern compartment as an example. It was filled with bronze vessels, lacquerware, pottery containers, and bamboo baskets that seem to correspond to items in the funerary lists: “copper vessels from the grand kitchen” (dapao zhi jinqi 大庖之金器), “wooden vessels” (muqi 木器), “bamboo utensil baskets to be placed in the dining chamber” (shishi suoyi zhiluo 食室所以置笿), and “foodstuff for the dining chamber” (shishi zhi shi 食室之食). The eastern compartment therefore may have been conceptualized as the “dining chamber” for Shao Tuo to continuously enjoy his meals in the afterlife. Similarly, the northern compartment contains items that one would find in a study or office for a literate elite like Shao Tuo: a wooden low-table, a sitting mat, small bronze oil lamps, wooden attendant figurines, a zither, writing utensils of brush and scribal scrapper, and bamboo manuscript documents. Additionally, while the southern compartment was equipped with disassembled chariots and fittings, as well as weapons that were suitable to Shao Tuo’s elite social and economic status, the western compartment was furnished with, among other things, an exquisitely designed folding bed, two sword-wearing attendant wooden figurines, and remains of textile items. In the funerary lists, there was an entry on “items for traveling to relocate [to the afterlife]” (xiangxi zhiqi suoyi xing相徙之器所以行) in which a “foldable bed” (shouchuang 收牀), along with many types of shoes, caps, and kerchiefs were recorded. Lastly, the middle compartment was bolstered with a similar box-like but smaller wooden structure (neiguo 内槨 “inner casket”), in which three nested and exquisitely lacquer-painted coffins were placed. The body of Shao Tuo, layers of blankets and clothes, and personal items such as swords and jade ornaments were found in the inner most coffin that contained his body. The entombed objects and the funerary lists in Baoshan M2 together shed new light on the ritual process that Shao Tuo’s death and subsequent burial had initiated and the material world in which they were embedded. 

The most significant source of information about the religious world in which Shao Tuo lived are the divination and sacrifice records that were interred with him. It should be noted that similar divination records have been found in other tombs that also dated to the 4th century BCE in the broadly defined former Chu cultural regions in present Hubei and Henan provinces. Since the 1960s, at least 11 tombs from large-scale ones to medium sized have yielded such kind of records, some of which contained the same name of a particular diviner. This suggests that such divination was probably practiced by a wider circle of Chu elites. However, these entombed records greatly varied in numbers from several hundreds to one single slip, partly reflecting the status of the patrons, and partly due to their different degree of preservation. The records found in Shao Tuo’s tomb are by far the best preserved and thus most complete, giving us a fuller picture of not only the highly formulaic format but also the complex relations between the living world and the unseen realm of the spirits. The Baoshan divination and sacrifice records were written on 54 bamboo slips (67.1-69.6cm), containing 22 times of divinations and 4 times of sacrifices performed by professional diviners and ritualists on behalf of Shao Tuo in the last three years of his life (318-316 BCE). Shao Tuo’s diviners used similar methods—cracking (bu卜) and casting (shi 蓍)—that had been used for almost a millennium in the northern Shang and Zhou traditions. Unlike the Shang oracle bones that recorded terse information directly on the cracked turtle shells and animal bones, or referencing the hexagram interpretations as they are collected in the Changes of Zhou (Zhouyi 周易), the Chu divination and sacrifice was narrated on bamboo slips that focus on prescribing efficacious ritual actions to address the diagnosed problems believed to be inflicted by the spiritual world. It was common to have multiple diviners to perform repeated divinations on the same topic, usually on the same day, each proposing a course of ritual actions. For example, in the Baoshan records, a total of ten divinations were performed by five different diviners, each doing two rounds, not long before Shao Tuo’s death, in 316 BCE. However, as the Baoshan sacrifice records show, not all prescriptions were followed through and only selected proposals of ritual actions were carried out. The topics of divination and sacrifice in the case of Shao Tuo fall into two categories. As Minister on the Left at the Chu royal court, diviners periodically—more precisely in the case of Shao Tuo, annually, based on the interred three-year records—divined on Shao Tuo’s service to the king and his prospect of obtaining more noble titles. Then in early 317 BCE, Shao Tuo seemed to have developed some acute illness in his abdomen that prevented him from eating, and subsequently divinations on the prospect of his physical wellbeing became more frequent. Shao Tuo’s illness gradually progressed and then quickly worsened toward the end of 317 BCE, and he died less in a year, in 316 BCE. Although the concerns that initiated the divination varied, these highly formulaic records show that they shared the basic mechanism of addressing the issues of concern, that is, to communicate with a broad spirit world that included not only the former kings of Chu and lineage ancestors of Shao Tuo as well as family members who met unfortunate or untimely death, but also forces of the land, especially spirits of mountains and rivers. Similarly, sacrificial offerings in a variety of manners, as proposed in their respective divinations, were given by ritualists on behalf of Shao Tuo, sometimes at different locations depending on the recipients of the offerings. 

What remains unclear is why the bamboo manuscripts including administrative documents and records of divination and sacrifice found in Baoshan M2 were buried with the deceased Shao Tuo in his carefully constructed and deliberately curated tomb. One possible explanation is to consider the underlying conceptualization of burial at the time for elites like Shao Tuo, which may not be the place that marks the end of a narrowly defined physical or biological existence but a site for a broadly defined social life that continuously involves actors of both the living and the spiritual.",-400,-278,1413,36,Jue Guo,2022-01-14 19:58:13.582 +0100,2022-03-18 17:49:38.462 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1268,Monotheistic Pre-Islamic South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry treats the state religion of Pre-Islamic South Arabia from the second half of the fourth century CE until the region was absorbed by the Sassanians in the seventh century CE. During this time, the ruling Himyarites not only expanded South Arabia to its largest territorial extent ever, spanning from modern Yemen to lower Iraq and perhaps even to Palestine (Robin, 2012), but they also adopted a new form of monotheism, which was heavily influenced by but distinct from Judaism. This Judaizing Himyarite Monotheism worshipped a monotheistic deity called either Raḥmānān “The Merciful” or ʾIlān “God.” While details about this religion are sparse, Philostorgius provides some hints concerning its character. He records that Constantius II sent an expedition to Himyarites (called “Homeritae”) in South Arabia in what would be the time of Thaʾrān Yuhanʿim (324-375 CE). He describes the Himyarites as “of the Israelitish family” but notes that they sacrificed to various native gods. There were also Jews in the royal court, who are said to unsuccessfully oppose the Christian embassy, as Philostorgius alleges that the Himyaritic king converted to Christianity and built three churches. Yet during that time, public state sponsorship of polytheism did not cease in the epigraphic record. It is not until the reign of Thaʾrān’s son, Malkīkarib Yuhaʾmin (375-400 CE; Robin, 2012), that worship in the monumental display texts was almost unilaterally directed to Raḥmānān, with mentions of the old gods becoming almost extinct (yet, they still persist in the less public stick inscriptions; Stein, 2009). Explicitly Jewish inscriptions also begin appearing in fourth century CE; albeit, the exact relationship of South Arabian Judaism with other outside contemporary Jewish groups remains unclear (Hughes, 2020a). There is further uncertainty as to whether their God, who is twice explicitly called “The Lord of the Jews,” was originally identified via syncretism with Raḥmānān or if he was thought to be a separate distinct but still monotheistic divinity, who existed alongside Raḥmānān (Gajda, 2017). Regardless of this potential distinction, the name Raḥmānān does eventually get absorbed into local Christian and Jewish vocabulary as a moniker for “God.” During the fifth century CE, the state continues to sponsor Himyarite Judaizing Monotheism all-the-while tensions between Christians and Jews begin to rise. The Martyrdom of Azqir (Conti-Rossini, 1910) records a priest named Azqir being arrested for proselytizing. He was then brought to trial before the Himyarite king (who is not said to be Jewish) and the Jews on his court. The text ends with Azqir’s martyrdom, with the narrator noting that thirty eight Christians had received a similar fate during that king’s reign. In the sixth century CE, state sponsorship of Judaizing Himyarite Monotheism disappears as the Ethiopian Aksumites gradually gained control of South Arabia and installed a Christian king, Maʿdīkarib Yaʿfur, on the South Arabian throne in 519 CE. Around this time, the Christians began to persecute the Jews. When Maʿdīkarib dies a few years later in 522 CE, a Jewish prince named Yūsuf Asʾar Yathʾar (Arabic Dhū Nuwās) began a series of military campaigns seeking to expel the Aksumites and to burn their churches (Robin, 2012). This culminated in the slaying of the Martyrs of Najrān in 523 CE, wherein the Jewish King Yūsuf gained control of Najrān by artifice and then systematically kills the Christians. This event gave justification for the Aksumite King Kaleb to invade South Arabia, during which he killed Yūsuf and violently seeks vengeance on the Jews. South Arabia thereafter would remain under Christian control until it was eventually acquired by the Sassanians.",360,570,1414,1010,Jason Weimar,2022-01-17 21:41:21.189 +0100,2022-01-27 04:22:56.354 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1269,Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu 集神州三寶感通錄,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu 集神州三寶感通錄 is a collection of miracle tales completed in 664 by the Tang dynasty scholar monk Daoxuan 道宣 (596-667). Miracle tales record the accounts of monks, lay believers, patrons, of sacred places as well as religious objects, structures, and scriptures. These stories are didactic by nature, teaching of the supremacy of the Buddhist faith by recounting miraculous events related to acts of spreading the Teaching (hongfa 弘法) and defending Buddhism in the face of adversity (hufa 護法). After gathering sources for decades out in the field and in the libraries of the Ximing Monastery 西明寺, Chang’an, Daoxuan completed this text at the secluded Jingye Monastery 靜業寺 in the Zhongnan mountains near the capital. Daoxuan and Daoshi 道世 (d. 683) collaborated at Ximing, and many of the accounts that appear in the Record of Miracles, also appear in Daoshi’s great Buddhist encyclopedia, the Fayuan zhulin 法苑珠林 (A Forest of Pearls from the Dharma Garden). A quick glance at the sources used in the Record of Miracles reveals that the two primary outside sources used were the Mingxiang ji 冥祥記 (Records of Signs From the Unseen Realm; c.490) by Wang Yan 王琰 and the Gaoseng zhuan 高僧傳 (Biographies of Eminent Monks; c.530) by Huijiao 慧皎—two foundational texts in the biography and miracle tale tradition. Additionally, Daoxuan was an assiduous recorder of Buddhist history who did not fail to read official sources, especially the court histories such as the Wei shu 魏書 (History of the Wei), the Liang shu 梁書 (History of the Liang), and the Zhou shu 周書 (History of the [Northern] Zhou). He also took from sources concerned with local history, often referring to geographical works, gazetteers as well as local records.
The Record of Miracles is divided into five thematic sections distributed over three fascicles. These sections are (1) the miracles relating to Buddhist relics (Skt. śarīra) and the pagodas that mark their location (sheli biaota 舍利表塔) in the first fascicle; (2) the miracles relating to the discovery of numinous Buddhist images (lingxiang chuilong 靈像垂降) in the second fascicle; (3) finally, the miracles relating to holy monasteries (shengsi 聖寺), (4) numinous teachings (lingjiao 靈教), (5) and extraordinary monks (shenseng 神僧) in the third fascicle. The overarching themes of this text revolve around the tripartite classification of Buddhist religious life into different “Jewels” (Skt. triratna; Ch. sanbao 三寶), with separate sections of the text corresponding to separate aspects of the Three Jewels. Following this thematic schema, (1) the sections on relics, pagodas and images correspond to the buddhas; (2) the section on auspicious scriptures corresponds to the teachings; (3) the sections on holy monasteries and extraordinary monks correspond to the monastic community.",266,664,1416,1073,Nelson Landry,2022-01-18 04:10:30.466 +0100,2022-07-21 14:23:37.043 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1270,The Zhuangzi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This entry explores the creation and development of the Zhuangzi (Chuang tzu), purportedly written by Zhuang Zhou 莊周 (d. 286 BCE) and his followers. The text of the Zhuangzi is traditionally divided into 33 chapters--Inner, Outer, and Miscellaneous chapters--but these divisions were created after the author's death by commentators and editors. The Inner chapters are purportedly the closest to Zhuang Zhou’s original meaning. While it is unclear if a religious group or network existed during the early formation and transmission of the text, later centuries of transmitted materials and excavation sites reveal that the Zhuangzi was collected and read by elites and was considered a valuable Daoist text. Although later scholars of religion made a clear differentiation between “philosophical Daoism” and “religious Daoism,” of which the Zhuangzi belongs in the former, those are not historically accurate terms. In fact, the Zhuangzi was added to the Daoist canon (Daozang) relatively early (some say as early as the 5th century) but the earliest extant version (thus far) dates to 1445 CE and the Ming dynasty.

The central tenant of the text is the concept of the Dao as a Way or path to live one’s life in accordance with nature but unlike texts such as the Daodejing, the Zhuangzi is more interested in ways to pursue happiness and an ease or flow of the mind that can be realized by an individual with a change in perspective. Categorizations made by humans in an effort to understand the world around them are always inaccurate and prevent us from truly understanding the Dao.  Tapping into the Dao is the only way to truly live one’s life to the fullest. Making use of parables, stories, and humorous dialogues, the author(s) of the Zhuangzi expand the concept of the Dao posed by the Daodejing and how it relates to the internal world of the mind. Society and governments are not important to the Zhuangzi. The text focuses on  the ideal human as a perfect Sage, but such a learned individual is not exactly the same Sage as we find in the Daodejing. According to the Zhuangzi, the Sage is happy and freely wanders the cosmos and is integrated to it in mysterious ways. Breath (qi 氣) and essence (jing 精) are basic elements to life, and understanding how we can link such life-essentials to the Dao is part of the focus of the text. Such mystical elements found in the Zhuangzi set the stage for later Daoist schools to expand longevity practices and other forms of meditation. Cultivating one’s breath and essence can cause spiritual and physical transformations to a person, and in later periods of history, Daoist longevity techniques focused on how to transform oneself into an immortal using some of the concepts introduced in the Zhuangzi (e.g. fasting the mind xinzhai 心齋 and sitting in oblivion zuowang 坐忘).",-551,1911,1417,1053,Anna-Alexandra Fodde-Reguer,2022-01-18 20:59:02.089 +0100,2022-02-11 18:10:45.843 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1271,Command to Fu Yue 傅說之命,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"“Command to Fu Yue” 傅說之命 (Fu Yue zhi ming) is a Warring States manuscript part of the collection purchased by the Tsinghua University in 2008. The collection has been dated to circa 350 BCE. It has been published in volume three (2012) of the series. The manuscripts narrates the story of Fu Yue 傅說, well known in the ancient literature. According to the legend, he lived during the reign of king Wu Ding 武丁 (traditional dates 1250-1129 BCE), working as a laborer. One night, the king had a dream; in the dream, he is told that there is a sage in his reign, whose name and looks are revealed to the king. He thus produced images resembling what he had seen in his dream, and sent his aids out in his reign to look for Fu Yue, who was eventually found and brought back to court to become a crucial component of king Wu Ding’s reign. ___ The manuscript is divided into three sections, separated by a blank space; it may be argued that the three are in fact three separate compositions. Each one is titled “Command to Fu Yue” on the verso side. The first section narrates king Wu Ding’s dream, and introduces Fu Yue as serving a different lord. The flow of the narrative is interrupted by an act of divination whose pertinency has puzzled scholars. The first part ends with Fu Yue settling in the king’s court. The second part opens with Fu Yue again reaching Wu Ding’s court, another suggestion that perhaps these three sections are in fact three different stories. An exchange with Wu Ding follows, where the king exhorts Fu Yue to be diligent and a loyal servant. It also warns Fu Yue to be ready for difficult times. The passage uses famous metaphors found in the literature, and the language style is that of bronze inscriptions. ___ The third part is constituted entirely of king’s (likely Wu Ding, although the name of the king is never specified) invocations and commands opened by the formulaic “the King said” 王曰. Presumably, these statements are addressed to Fu Yue. As with the second part, the king exhorts his minister to be a loyal servant, not to yield during difficult times, and not disappoint Heaven. ___ The manuscript is most famous in relation to the Exalted Writings 尚書. Of the 25 “forged” chapters (see Shangshu entry in this database), three go by the title “Command to Yue” 說命 (divided in 上中下). Because of the tripartite division of the manuscript, as well as the closeness of the topic, the Tsinghua “Command to Fu Yue” has been identified as the “original” chapter of the Shangshu collection (Li Xueqing; Liao Mingchun). Push-backs against this secure and linear identification arrived soon after (e.g., Li Rui; Ed Shaughenssy); too much information is still missing about the production of these manuscripts and the formation of the Shangshu to make such definite claims. ___ By comparing the manuscript “Command to Fu Yue” to the “Command to Yue” chapters in the received Exalted Writings, several observations can be drawn, although these are more revealing of the fourth century CE intellectual environment that produced the “forged” chapters of the Exalted Writings. A striking difference is the way in which the interaction between Wu Ding and his minister Fu Yue is portrayed. In the circa 350 BCE manuscript, the king commands and orders his soon-to-be minister for loyalty and upright behavior to sustain government. Fu Yue utters a handful of words, and is otherwise not active (or even mentioned) in the narration; by reading the third part of the Tsinghua “Command to Fu Yue” especially, one imagines Fu Yue to be listening in silence. This is very reminiscent of bronze inscriptions, in which kings talk authoritatively to obedient, and for the most silent, ministers. ___ The fourth century CE “Command to Yue,”  instead, portrays Fu Yue as talkative, having a proper dialogue with the king. The production of the latter was most likely influenced by Warring States intellectual narrations on kings and ministers. During the Warring States, intellectuals and aspiring ministers (sometimes identified as the shi 士 class) become steady protagonists of literary works, likely a reflection of a new importance given to their social class in real-life politics. In these works, they are portrayed as having long exchanges with rulers, outmaneuvering their questions with rhetorical devices, hardly ever interrupted in their disquisition which, very often, are crowned by rulers’ praises. Here I suggest that whoever composed the “Command to Yue” in the fourth century CE was imagining their own ancient past on the basis of Warring States narratives and documents, that thus shaped the way in which minister-ruler interaction was portrayed. It remains to be explored what documents the author(s) of “Command to Yue” consulted. ___ For reference, the Tsinghua collection is a collection of manuscripts purchased by Tsinghua University in 2008.

1272,"*The Heart is what is at the center, *Xin shi wei Zhong 心是謂中",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"*The Heart is what is at the center (*Xin shi wei Zhong 心是謂中) is a short manuscript published in the eight volume of the Qinghua daxue cang Zhanguo zhujian 清華大學藏戰國竹簡 (2018). The 7 strips (around 44 cm long) are largely well preserved (only strip one and six are broken at the end), not numbered, and there are no cuts on the verso side that preserve their ordering. The sequence in which the editors put them is largely uncontested; Zi Ju argued that *The Heart is only one part of a longer text, but there is no evidence to support this claim. ___ The text is otherwise unprecedented; several scholars have noted that its content is reminiscent of other philosophical statements on the heart (Xin 心), its relationship to the body (ti 體), and  Heaven (tian 天) recorded in Mengzi 孟子, Xunzi 荀子, and other manuscripts such as the Guodian manuscript Xing zi ming chu 性自命出. Yet *The Heart also contains otherwise unseen statements, such as the idea that humans chan choose their destiny (取命). The text has no central argument, but is a collection of short statements about the heart. For example, it states that the  heart is positioned as the central organ, the one that makes decisions and is in this light compared to the ruler (jun 君). This has given rise to a series of readings of this text as a political composition and somewhat a precursor of the philosophy of fa 法 (generally translated as “legalist”) (e.g. Can Feng 2019), but more evidence needs be found to support such linear identification. __ Like with many other manuscripts that characterize Warring States collections, *The Heart is better explained as a model or perhaps a teaching tool, a text clearly part of the conversations ongoing in Warring States philosophical circles (Shen Jianhua 2019 mentions this in the conclusions, but does not elaborate on the subject). The author defines writings of this nature “performance supports.” ___ For context, the Tsinghua collection is a collection of manuscripts purchased by Tsinghua University in 2008.

1274,Russian orthodox mission in Japan,43,Religious Group (v6),"In the Meiji era when Japan took the path of modernization along Western patterns, the country became open to Christian influences. The Russian orthodox church began its missionary work with sending Nicholas to Japan. In contrast to the missionary activities of other (Western) Christian confessions, the history of the Russian orthodox mission to Japan presents a lacuna. The task of the Russian orthodox mission was not only to convert Japanese to Christian orthodox belief in competition to Western Christian confessions, but also to spread the Russian language and culture, and to seed a positive image of Imperial Russia among the Japanese population. It is worth mentioning that despite of all Russo-Japanese constraints in the Twentieth century, i.e. from the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/1905 and the dispute over the Kuriles after 1945, the legacy of the Russian orthodox mission in Japan is permanent. Until today there exists an independent Japanese orthodox community. The nucleus of the Russian orthodox mission was the Resurrection Church as part of the Russian consulate in Hakodate, opened in 1858 after the signing of the Treaty of Shimoda (1855) which initiated the diplomatic relations between Russia and Japan. The first task of the church was to provide orthodox services to the Russian diplomatic staff. This was the task of Nikolai (Nicholas) Kasatkin who arrived in 1861. From the very beginning Kasatkin showed a great affinity to Japan, he learnt Japanese and he thoroughly studied the Japanese culture. By this he gained a deep understanding of Japanese mentality and mores. Due to the animosity of the Japanese government toward foreign Christian missionaries in the 1870s, Kasatkin began to train native Japanese orthodox preachers. This was the beginning of the native Japanese orthodox community in Japan. In 1874 there were 900 Japanese orthodox believers, about 100 in Tokyo, about 300 in Hakodate, and about 500 in Sendai. Four years later there were 4,215 Japanese orthodox converts. The Russian orthodox church (ROC) showed a different approach to her missionary work in Japan than the Roman Catholics and Protestants. The ROC used native preachers to spread Russian orthodoxy. Additionally, the ROC aimed at missioning households, not individuals, as Japanese wives were attracted by religious education. In this way, Kasatkin founded a women school. The problem of the Russian orthodox mission in Japan was the lack of sufficient funding by the Russian imperial government. The Roman Catholics received twenty-six and the Protestants fifteen times more money for the missionary activities.",1861,1945,1419,975,Eva Stolberg,2022-01-20 10:35:59.580 +0100,2022-03-04 09:13:52.455 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1276,The Old Monastery of Baramus,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"North of the present Monastery of Virgin Mary of Baramūs in the Wādī al-Naṭrūn (the ancient desert of Sketis) there is a site, formerly known as Dayr Abū Mūsā al-’Aswad (Monastery of Saint Moses the Black). However, certain researchers argued that it could be identified with the Old Monastery of Baramūs. 
According to the hagiological tradition, this settlement was founded on the topos of the ‘Two Little Strangers’. By the end of the fourth century a laura already existed in its environs, which is regarded as one of the earliest communities organised in the desert of Sketis.
The excavations, which were carried out by a team from Leiden University (the Netherlands), under the direction of Dr. Karel C. Innemée, brought to light the remains of a monastic compound. So far, it seems that the nucleus of the compound is the church, which has been remodelled in five different phases. At the south-eastern corner of the site a square-shaped building was uncovered; it has been considered to have been a defence tower, dating back to the fourth/fifth century, namely the earlier period of the settlement. In the western part of the complex, as well as at the north-eastern corner, parts of the living quarters or cells of the monks have been discovered. The pottery finds suggest that these cells were not inhabited before the late sixth to seventh centuries. Throughout the site a ninth century destruction level is evident. This monastic complex was in existence until the sixteenth century.",380,1500,1150,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2022-01-22 16:20:54.665 +0100,2022-11-08 23:44:24.815 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1281,Otoro Nuba,43,Religious Group (v6),"The term Nuba refers to over 50 distinct ethnic groups residing in the Nuba Hills of what is now Sudan (Adem, 2019:1). Otoro refers to a particular Nuba tribe that occupies the Otoro Hills hill chain. This entry focuses on the Otoro Nuba during the 1930s, and relies primarily on ethnographic information from principal ethnographic authority Siegfried Frederick Nadel. Nadel conducted fieldwork with the Nuba from 1938-1941, during which time the region was under British control as part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. While the Otoro had come into contact with European cultures and the primarily Muslim and Arabic population of the surrounding area, European and Islamic influences on the Otoro at the time of Nadel’s fieldwork were limited. At this time, the Otoro lived in eight separate hill communities, each containing many homesteads or small villages.  The Otoro were organized into 35 patrilineal and strictly exogamous clans, ranging in size from 20 to 130 families (Nadel, 1947:92). An age grade system was also utilized: at puberty, Otoro males were assigned to an age-based group and collectively underwent initiation rituals that created strong social bonds. At the time of Nadel’s writing, the Otoro were developing a system of chieftainship. Each hill of the Otoro Hills had a separate chief with the skills necessary to interact with external bureaucratic entities. Religious leaders included priests with various specialties, such as the rain-maker or the grain priest. The Otoro rituals and ceremonies centered largely around the agricultural calendar and the life cycle. Although not described in substantial ethnographic detail, supernatural beings were identified as being present in the form of previously human spirits. For the Otoro, religious beliefs were  inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1910,1945,1428,1090,Anj Droe,2022-01-27 23:11:38.526 +0100,2022-03-13 22:45:32.626 +0100,eHRAF
1283,Butonese Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Butonese, also known as Orang Butung or Orang Butuni is a collective term that embraces diverse ethnic groups (such as the Tukang Besi, Muna* and Wolio) from the island of Buton and neighboring islands that constitute the Indonesian province of Sulawesi Tenggara (Southeast Sulawesi). The Butonese population (estimated at ~ 236,000) mostly professes Islam. Historically seafarers, the Butonese migrated from Johor (today's Malaysia) to the island of Buton and have subsequently immigrated to the Moluccas, the center of Indonesia's spice production in search of better economic opportunities. 

The Butonese Sultanate (founded ~ 1540), with the conversion of the Sixth Raja of Buton to Islam, occupied a strategic position in the coastal trade between Java and Makassar, on one hand and the Moluccas, on the other. The sovereignty of the Butonese Sultanate was challenged around the seventeenth century due to the power struggle between Makassar and Ternate for the control of the spice trade. By 1613, Butonese Sultan La Elangi liaised with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to free the Sultanate from the power struggle between Makassar and Ternate. But by 1669, the Sultanate was placed under the suzerainty of Pax Neerlandica by principle although in practice, the principality was independent until 1906. Subsequent to Indonesian independence (1945) and the transfer of power to the Indonesian Republic (1949), Buton continued to remain a Sultanate until 1960 when the principality was merged into the Indonesian republic.

* Muna do not consider themselves Butonese although the  Muna-Buton languages belong to the Celebic sub-group of Austronesian family to which Wolio belongs. So, it would be safe to generalize that Butonese refers to the inhabitants of the former Sultanate of Buton (prior to 1960).",1500,2002,1431,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-02-01 11:26:19.185 +0100,2022-02-13 06:55:49.373 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1284,Religion of Phoenicia,43,Religious Group (v6),"The religion of Phoenicia was based on a polytheistic system. The high degree of political fragmentation of the city kingdoms of the Levantine coast implied that each center had its own pantheon, characterized by specific features although structurally similar to that adopted in other cities. Usually, at the top of this system was placed a couple of divinities, considered as polyadic entities, owners of the territory. Thus, for example, Byblos was dominated by the Baalat Gubal (literally the ""Lady of Byblos"") and by a local Baal (identified by the Greeks with Adonis), while in Sidon, at the head of the city religion, Eshmun and Astarte were worshipped; further south, in the rich and powerful Tyre, Astarte was once again conceived as protector of the city, this time next to Melqart, the ""King of the city"" (as the name openly states, from milk, ""king"", + qrt, ""city""). The polyadic gods were then joined, obviously, by other figures, each one - such as Baal Shamim, the ""Lord of the heavens"", Baal Hammon, ""the lord of the house chapel (?)"", or Shadrafa, the "" healing genius”- playing a specific role within the particular conception of the world, of nature and society, developed by the Phoenician culture. A direct and privileged relationship existed between the gods and the various city kings: the latter, who must and must still be ""just and righteous"", were emanations of divine power itself and had the task of maintaining balance between gods and men, ensuring the continuous communication between the divine and human spheres. Not surprisingly, one of the main roles of the sovereigns, who sometimes defined themselves as ""priests"", was to celebrate the divinities erecting or restoring their houses (the temples). Unfortunately, almost nothing of Phoenician mythology has been preserved so far. However, the Greek and Latin literary sources allow us to know some episodes and some themes, even if reread in the perspective of the sources themselves. Fundamental, for example, is the contribution of Philo of Byblos who wrote in Greek a ""Phoenician history"" in the second century AD (collecting the legacy of a mythical Phoenician priest, Sanchuniaton), some fragments of which have come to us thanks to the mediation of Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (4th century AD). Philo's work includes tales of cosmogony and theogony, in which it is possible to recognize elements of original Phoenician beliefs.",-1200,-330,1432,1095,Giuseppe Garbati,2022-02-01 12:00:20.894 +0100,2022-04-11 19:47:04.801 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1289,Buginese Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Buginese are a politically and ethnically dominant seafaring group from the Indonesian province of South Sulawesi (Sulawesi Selatan), occupying much of the province's fertile lowlands. The Buginese language (Basa Ugi) belongs to the South Sulawesi language group and is related to Makassarese, Toraja and Mandarese. 

Historians are uncertain about the early origins of the Buginese ( 2500 BC- 300 BC). Between 300 BC-1200 AD, the Buginese were organized into a number of small chiefdoms and practised wet-rice cultivation, especially in the upper Cenrana valley (~1200 AD). 

Around the thirteenth century, the Buginese experienced rapid social change due to the incorporation of South Sulawesi into the wider trading network of the Indian Ocean, that extended between China and India  via the Majapahit Empire centered on Eastern Java. The thirteenth century and the associated growth of trade in the Indian Ocean, witnessed a growth in wet rice cultivation, population increase, loosely unified kingdoms and growing social stratification of Buginese society (Caldwell 2004). The transvestite Buginese priests or Bissu guarded the kingdom's regalia and have pre-Islamic roots. 

The earliest Buginese kingdom of Luwu (before the sixteenth century) in the Gulf of Bone controlled the iron ore trade. The Luwu Bugis united disparate tribes of interior South Sulawesi. But by the sixteenth century, the Luwu kingdom was eclipsed by Makassar. The sixteenth century witnessed the rise of Makassar as an entrepot port and the union of the Makassar kingdom of Gowa with the kingdom of Tallo. 

The Luwu Bugis converted to Islam (~1605). The Buginese conversion to Islam is related to the legend of the Three Datok (Mak. Dato’ Tallua and Bug. Dato’ Tellue), who were the preachers or muballigh. By 1607, the principalities of Gowa and Tallo embraced Islam. Islamization in South Sulawesi had to come to terms with Adat or traditonal customs. The Three Datok tried to draw parallels between the Shariah (legal practice derived from the teachings of the Al Quran) and Adat or customary law such that Islam was not seen as an alien belief system (Sila 2015). Islamic preachers, especially Datok Pattimang interpreted the notion of ""tauhid"" or absolute oneness of God,not in strictly Islamic terms, but invoked the Buginese  notion of Dewata Seuwae (One God). Furthermore the preachers contended that the Buginese and the Makassarese people had descended from one God "" Parewa Sara"" and that the two groups were representatives of One God on Earth (Sila 2015). 

~ 1605, the Dutch made inroads into South Sulawesi to secure monopoly over the flourishing spice trade of Makassar. They secured the support of the Bone Bugis to defeat Gowa in a civil war (~1669). The principality of Bone, in effect, was recognized as the overlord of South Sulawesi in exchange for Dutch monopoly of the spice trade. The eighteenth century in Makassar coincided with a period of political instability in South Sulawesi, particularly rival claims to the throne of Gowa (~ 1739) and an uprising by a commoner in 1776 that drew on Buginese resentment against the Dutch presence in Makassar.

 During the brief British takeover of the Indies archipelago (1811-15), the Bone palace was ransacked. Uneasy relations between the Buginese rulers and the Dutch continued throughout the nineteenth century. In 1905, the Sultan of Bone was exiled to Batavia (now known as Jakarta).

The Dutch indirect rule in South Sulawesi (1905-41) made use of adat and the traditional hierarchies, extant in Buginese society. Subsequent to the conclusion of the Pacific War (1942-45), the notorious Dutch captain Raymond Westerling directed a brutal repression of nationalist forces in South Sulawesi. 

During the 1950s, the Sulawesi countryside was ravaged by the quasi-Islamic rebellion led by Kahar Muzakkar, a disaffected Buginese army officer. The rebels made attempts to wipe out non-Islamic elements of Buginese culture, resulting in the burning of traditional houses and manuscripts. The Indonesian central government reacted to the political unrest in the undivided province of Sulawesi by splitting the province into North and South Sulawesi in 1957. But the move did not take into account ethnic diversity of the province (Booth 2011). 

In the early 1960s, the two provinces of Sulawesi were split into four, an arrangement that continued until 1998. Fear of secessionist movements in the Outer Islands, fearful of Javanese political domination was the reason President Abdul Rehman Wahid (1999-2001) disembarked on a policy of administrative decentralization. In 2004, the province of West Sulawesi or Sulawesi Barat, with the Mandarese, comprising the single largest majority, was carved out of the parent province of South Sulawesi. In this case, the role of former President B.J. Habibie (1998-99) who hailed from Sulawesi was no less important. But attempts to carve out a new province in the northeastern part of South Sulawesi could not materialise due to ethnic and religious tensions that could not be reconciled between the Buginese and the Torajans. Nevertheless, administrative decentralization since 1999 has seen increased assertion of Buginese identity in the province of South Sulawesi.",1500,2004,1437,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-02-04 18:48:44.117 +0100,2022-02-13 19:58:24.609 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1290,"4QInstruction",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"4Q/1QInstruction, or Musar le-Mevin, is the most extensively preserved wisdom text among the Dead Sea Scrolls. The text was found in multiple copies in Cave 4 (4Q415, 4Q416, 4Q417, 4Q418, 4Q418a, 4Q423), while an additional copy was found in Cave 1 (1Q26). The earliest copy (4Q417) is dated to the end of the Hasmonean period (70 BCE), while the latest (4Q423) is dated to mid-late Herodian (10-50 CE). The provenance and the writing time of the text are controversial, and much depend on the attributed social context. 
The composition, which occasionally reflects apocalyptic perceptions, covers a wide range of topics, offering its readers insights and advice on different aspects of their lives. The material can be roughly divided into two categories: cosmological and practical wisdom. The cosmological parts address the relationship of the reader with God, his cast lot, and his assigned place in the cosmic structure of the universe. The practical wisdom offers advice on the social behaviour of its addressee, family and women, agriculture, or financial matters. 
4QInstruction resembles linguistically, literary, and ideologically with other wisdom works. The composition, undoubtedly, inspired and relies on the scriptural wisdom works as the Book of Proverbs, with whom it often shares rhetorical structure. Other textual similarities can be identified between the composition and the Wisdom of Ben Sira, including priestly references, for example, or some financial matters. Additionally, scholars emphasize the affinity between 4QInstruction to Hellenistic wisdom texts as the Wisdom of Solomon or the writings of Philo, point towards similar expressions or similar understanding of the creation and men. 
The possible context of the composition in is directly related to the question regarding the affinity between 4QInstruction, the movement associated with the Qumran site (the Yahad) and its writings. There is some resemblance between 4QInstruction and the core writings of the movement, especially the Community rule and the Hodayot (1QS and 1QH respectively, and their parallels in Cave 4). The affinity includes joint worldview and concepts, as well as the revelation of wisdom according to one’s status. Yet, it is ambiguous whether the text was written outside the community (for example, among priestly circles which rejected the authority of the temple) and adopted by the Yahad, or composed among the movement at some stage. The objectors for the latter point towards occasionally different halakhic perspectives between 4QInstruction and the Community Rule, or the sections which concerns women and family matters, topics which are absent from the Community Rule.",-100,50,1440,1091,Anna Shirav,2022-02-06 17:02:52.579 +0100,2022-03-09 22:08:34.401 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1292,Kourion Episcopal Basilica and Urban Precinct,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Located in the center of the Late Roman city of Kourion, the bascilical precinct occupied a space just off of the old Roman forum. The basilica itself measured 39.95m by 22.88m and was situated above an older, civic building of the Roman basilical type. This older building furnished much of the limestone and marble building material, and spolia is much in evidence. Three aisled, but with only a single apse, the church is unusual amongst the early basilicas of Cyprus, which usually had three apses; this was likely due to the exigencies of making use of the footprint of the earlier building. The basilica and its attendant buildings were likely constructed under the tenure of Bishop Zeno, who attended the Council of Ephesus in 431, and served to replace the earlier, as yet undiscovered, basilica which was almost certainly destroyed in the major earthquake of 365 (the exact date of this earthquake is disputed). Replete with opus sectile and mosaic flooring (in addition to gypsum slabs), marble champleve revetment, carved marble column bases, and expertly carved marble ecclesiastical furniture, such as the ambo, the Kourion basilica must have been opulent indeed. Large quantities of mother-of-pearl tesserae point to an ornamental, as opposed to figural, wall decoration in addition to the floor mosaics. Small gold tesserae found near the apse point to the possible inclusion of a mosaic of the Theotokos at some point in the 6th c. To either side of the sanctuary stood two catechumena, which connected to the spacious narthex. These were meant to hold the unbaptized converts (the Roman Empire began converting en mass to Christianity in the 4th c.). To the Northwest and North of the basilica, respectively, lie an atrium and baptistry. Roughly 20m on a side, the paved atrium, with a central hexagonal cistern, featured small marble columns and was surrounded by a series of rooms on all but its East side (from which the baptistry was accessed). These rooms extended down to the West of the basilica and joined with a heavily mosaiced diakonikon and a small courtyard with a fountain. It is thought these formed the episkopeion, and many of the rooms also feature mosaic and marble decoration. These rooms, on two stories, would have accommodated the clergy. In the 6th century a second story was added to those rooms on the West end, extending above the diakonikon. A mosaic inscription in the floor of the diakonikon features a portion of a psalm relating to the leaving of gifts. In 1959 excavators uncovered the remains of a wall mosaic in the diakonikon that seems to feature the Theotokos and child, and an unidentified archangel. Coin evidence points to a date somewhere in the early 7th c. The three aisled baptistry, again with one apse, featured a cruciform font set into the South wall, and lavish mosaic decoration. Again, as with much of the precinct, renovation appears to have taken place in the early 7th c. In the mid-7th c. Kourion was subject to two Umayyad raids, and small traces of the cleanup have been found in the episcopal precinct, as well as a number of Arab and Arab-Byzantine coins that may date to the period of the Condominium. 

The end of the Kourion Episcopal Basilica can be attributed to a catastrophic earthquake at some point late in the 7th c. The southwestern portion of the narthex collapsed, and a diagonal wall was inserted to try and support the remaining superstructure. There are additional signs of violent seismic action in the structural remains. Coins at the site speak to continued activity into the 8th c., but at this point the basilica was dismantled and elements have been found at the nearby, and still occupied, village of Episkopi.",431,700,1442,913,Ian Randall,2022-02-09 10:06:26.936 +0100,2022-02-09 12:39:36.082 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1294,The Autobiography of Adad-guppi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Adad-guppi inscription is a rare pseudo-autobiography of a woman with political and religious power in the ancient Near East. Two copies of the inscription were discovered: one poorly preserved text excavated in 1907 at the archaeological site of Harran in southern Turkey, and another more complete copy discovered in 1958 as a part of the pavement steps to the Great Mosque at Harran. The text, written in Neo-Babylonian Cuneiform dating to the sixth century BCE, celebrates Adad-guppi’s devotion to the gods, her service to the royal court and her role as queen mother to her son Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon. The monument stood in the ancient city of Harran in the moon god temple, named the Ehulhul, which was newly rebuilt by Nabonidus following its destruction during the Assyrian and Babylonian battle for power in the late seventh century BCE. Although the inscription is written as a first-person account by Adad-guppi, the emphasis on Nabonidus’s right to kingship and the details of Adad-guppi’s funeral support that it was created by someone in the royal court following Adad-guppi’s death. The nature of the text is apologetic, seeking to justify the kingship of Adad-guppi’s son Nabonidus, who ascended the throne despite his questionable royal lineage. According to the inscription, Adad-guppi was born in the reign of Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (649 BCE) and died during reign of her son Nabonidus (547 BCE). This would make her an astonishing 104 years old, which is about 70 years past life expectancy during that time. While it is not mentioned in this text, other sources tell us that her husband was a court servant named Nabu-balastu-iqi. Following the fall of Assyria in 609 BCE, Adad-guppi served in the Neo-Babylonian royal court and became queen mother during the tumultuous reign of Nabonidus. The inscription claims that Adad-guppi and Nabonidus respectfully served Babylonian kings Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar, and Neriglissar and made gracious funerary offerings upon each of their deaths because their close kin did not perform the necessary rites for their deceased relatives. The assertion that those with familial claim to the throne did not exhibit piety to gods or kings is in contrast to Nabonidus’s devoutness that eventually rewarded him with kingship over Babylon’s irreverent legitimate heirs. Historical sources describe how Nabonidus usurped the throne from Babylonian king Labashi-Marduk in 556 BCE just a month into his reign. By his and his mother’s own accounts, Nabonidus was not the next in line for the throne, but the inscription stresses that their devotion to the moon god landed him the position. Nabonidus was strong enough to maintain his position as ruler for sixteen years until 539 BCE when the Achaemined Persians annexed the Babylonian empire. The text notably favors the moon god Sin calling him the “king of the gods,” which is a departure from the exultation of Marduk, the traditional Babylonian chief deity. While the heartland of the Babylonian empire was in lower Mesopotamia, this text focuses on the city of Harran and the Ehulhul. It was not unlike Nabonidus to favor a city outside of Babylon as he did by living in Tayma, an oasis in the Saudi Arabian desert, for ten years during his reign. The destruction of Harran is framed as a consequence of Sin leaving the city in anger, and Adad-guppi’s pious pleading was meant to entice Sin back to his residence in Harran just as it had secured her son’s kingship. Because of Adad-guppi’s devotion to the gods, she did not suffer any ailments that often come with old age, stating that her eyesight, limbs, appetite, and heart remained in good condition, and she witnessed four generations of her descendants. Of these descendants, we are aware of Nabonidus, king of Babylon, and his two children, Belshazzar the crown prince, and Ennigaldi, high priestess of the moon god at the temple in Ur. The destruction of the Ehulhul in Harran appears to be of great concern to Adad-guppi, and the gods respond to her pleas with a promise that the temple and city would be restored to a beauty surpassing their former glory. Nabonidus apparently carried out reconstruction but did not complete the temple until after Adad-guppi’s death. The fragmentary end of the inscription details Adad-guppi’s burial and funerary procession, including particulars about being interred with garments and a mantel of gold and precious stones. Nabonidus slaughtered a sheep as part of the ritual for his deceased mother and ordered people throughout the empire to mourn for seven days, casting their clothes and cutting their hair. Mourners were then anointed with fine perfume and rejoiced as they went back to their homes. The inscription asserts that piety in one’s worldly life will keep one’s descendants safe and privileged, and Adad-guppi and her son Nabonidus were exemplars of such piety.",-649,-539,1445,1104,Heidi Fessler,2022-02-11 18:15:55.959 +0100,2022-02-11 19:26:08.258 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1295,Donatism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Donatist controversy erupted in early fourth century Roman North Africa in the immediate aftermath of the Diocletianic persecution. The North African church was heir to the legacy of Cyprian of Carthage, whose belief that lapsed bishops were ineligible to administer the sacraments would prove crucial in the events that followed. During the Diocletianic persecution, a rift developed within the church over the status of bishops who had complied with the authorities and handed over their copies of the scriptures to be burned, an action referred to as traditio. In response to rumors that the newly-elected bishop of Carthage, a man named Caecilian, had been ordained by such a compromised bishop, a group of seventy bishops from Numidia denounced his ordination as illegitimate and elevated an alternate candidate to the Carthaginian bishopric. After their candidate was rejected at the councils of Rome in 313 and Arles in 314, the dissidents, called “Donatists” by their opponents after their charismatic second leader, Donatus of Carthage, were considered schismatic by the wider Christian church. 
Within Roman North Africa proper (modern Tunisia, Algeria, and parts of Morocco), congregations that viewed Donatus and his successors as the legitimate bishops of Carthage seem to have been in the majority throughout the fourth century. Failed repressions by the emperors Constantine in the 320s and Constans in the late 340s created a strong self-narrative among the dissidents that theirs was the church that “suffers persecution but does not cause it” (Gesta Carth. 3.258), though violent reprisals by Donatist partisans known as Circumcellions against their Caecilianist opponents tarnished this claim. Despite their “schismatic” status, Donatist writers were influential among Latin Christian communities outside of North Africa, especially the maverick theologian Tyconius, whose Book of Rules and Commentary on the Apocalypse dominated Western Christian approaches to exegesis and eschatology well into the Carolingian era. The Cyprianic position that schismatic bishops could not legitimately perform the sacraments led many Donatist communities to require converts from the rival church to be baptized upon entry, a practice their opponents decried as “rebaptism.”
The decline of the dissident communion can be attributed in large part to the efforts of Caecilianist opponents like Augustine of Hippo and Aurelius of Carthage in the 390s, which culminated in an imperial edict in 405 imposing heavy fines and confiscation of property on adherents. This edict was reified in 411 at an imperially-sanctioned debate between the two sides at Carthage. Donatism survived as a coherent movement long after the Vandal invasion of the 430s, and was last referenced as a contemporary phenomenon in the letters of Pope Gregory I late in the sixth century.",311,600,1446,1074,Jesse Hoover,2022-02-14 07:59:24.131 +0100,2022-02-15 00:26:37.804 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1297,Chen-Wei Texts,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Chen-Wei Texts, or “prophetic-apocryphal” texts, refer to a corpus of religious texts that prevailed from the 1st to the 7th century C.E. in China. Chen 讖, meaning subtle and fulfilled prophecy, represents a number of esoteric writings, such as the Hetu 河圖“Diagram of the Yellow River” and Luoshu 洛書 “Script of the Luo River.” An early appearance of Hetu in pre-Qin texts was described as precious stone or treasurable book. No later than the Warring States period, Hetu and Luoshu were commonly regarded as auspicious portents, in the form of texts with diagrams recording divination and prophecy. It was also believed that these texts sprang up from the Yellow and Luo rivers carried by mysterious animals, such as the dragon and turtle. Earlier Han (202 B.C.E.-8 C.E.) practitioners of magic methods produced a number of esoteric texts named after the Hetu and Luoshu. These texts circulated among the practitioners of magic methods (fangshi方士) and proto-Daoists from the Third to the First centuries B.C.E. These writings covered and mixed with knowledges and concepts of astrology, geography, divination, traditional medicine, ancient myths, and witchcraft, etc. In the Earlier Han, these writings were sometimes used as prognostication books for political interests, especially when imperial legitimation and Heaven’s Mandate were under examination. A high tide of political manipulation of the chen texts took place during Wang Mang’s 王莽usurpation of the Earlier Han and the establishment of Later Han (25-220), between 8 to 25 C.E. Once Emperor Guangwu 光武, the founding emperor of the Later Han, secured his throne, he instructed a few learned Confucian scholars to collate and purify the chen texts, ensuring that the prophetic messages were in favor of the Han imperial house. The Earlier Han Confucian teachings that had a mystical nature, such as the teachings of the Gongyang公羊 School, the Chunqiu fanlu春秋繁露 by Dong Zhongshu, the Jingshi Yizhuan 京氏易傳, Interpretation Associated with the Book of Change by Jing Fang京房, and Liu Xin’s 劉歆theories on Hongfan wuxing洪範五行, were also merged into “prophetic interpretation” (jingchen 經讖) associated with the Confucian canons. In the last year of Emperor Guangwu’s reign (56 C.E.), an endorsed version of the prophetic texts was publicly announced. According to Zhang Heng張衡(78-139), a renowned astronomer and writer, the endorsed version, under the corpus title of tuchen圖讖 “Diagram and Prophecy”, consisted of eighty one titles or volumes, including both Hetu and Luoshu and the prophetic interpretations associating with the “seven canons.” “Five Canons” and “Six Canons” were common terms used to refer to the Confucian classics in the Earlier and Later Han. “Seven Canons” occurs a few times in the Later Han materials, sometimes together with prophetic interpretations. The “Seven” indicates the Book of Change易, the Book of History書, the Book of Odes詩, the Book of Rites禮, the Book of Music樂, the Annals春秋, and the Book of Filial Piety孝經 (and in some occasions the Analects 論語). Encouraged by the Later Han authorities, the learning of prophetic texts played a predominantly ideological role during the Later Han and the Three Kingdoms periods. These prophetic interpretations, which prophesized the Han House’s legitimacy to receive Heaven’s Mandate, were soon accepted as a secret canon among the Later Han Confucian schools. The two branches of the texts, the esoteric writings named after the Hetu and Luoshu, and the prophetic interpretations associated with the seven canons, although derived from different religious or intellectual origins, soon began to interact each other and mutually penetrated. In the late period of the Later Han and then after, these texts were taken as a corpus often referred to as Chen-Wei, literally “prophecy and weft” (a counterpart to Jing經, “classic” or warp), a corpus of prophetic-apocryphal texts. Naming the prophetic interpretation texts after wei was a late Later Han phenomenon yet prevalent in post-Han eras.
As a double-edged sword routinely used in socio-political struggles, established powers became vigilant about the prophecies and offensive ideas in the Chen-Wei texts. A series of bans against the Chen-Wei texts were issued repeatedly by authorities one after another from the Third to Seventh centuries. Most parts of the Chen-Wei texts are no longer extant. From the middle of 14th to early 21st century, scholars have been working hard to collect and collate fragments of Chen-Wei and have been trying to put them together, wishing to restore the Han dynasty Chen-Wei texts to a certain extent. Dozens of Chen-Wei collections have been published. The most influential collection should be the Jushu Isho Shusei 重修緯書集成 [Revised Edition of the Collection of the Apocryphal Texts] (1971–1991) by Yasui Kôzan and Nakamura Shôhachi. However, textual problems remain in all existing collections: wrong collection, missing- collection, wrong title, wrong or missing source, suspicious source, wrong dating, etc. Currently, a research project led by Lu Zongli is in progress, attempting to re-collect and re-collate the Chen-Wei texts, which should be more accurate, more reliable and more authentic.",56,907,1272,1103,Zongli Lu,2022-02-17 13:36:57.021 +0100,2022-02-23 02:52:27.504 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1298,Masjid Al-Hilal,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Al-Hilal Masjid, more commonly known as the Katangka Old Mosque, is a royal mosque, situated in the village of Katangka on Syekh Yusuf Street (named after the Sufi mystic Syekh Yusuf al-Makassari, 1626-99) in the kecamatan (sub-district) of Somba Opu in the kabupaten (district) of Gowa, on the immediate outskirts of Makassar in the province of Sulawesi Selatan (South Sulawesi). 

Syekh Yusuf (whose maternal ancestors hailed from the Gowa royalty) founded the Khalwatiyah tarekat or order of Sufism. Between 1640-44, he was trained by Syekh Jalaluddin, a prominent Acehnese Ulama (body of Muslim scholars who have specialized knowledge of Islam). Between 1649-1659, during his sojourn in the Middle East, he came in contact with the teachings of prominent Sufi tarekats such as Syattariyah. 

After spending nearly a decade in the Middle East (1649-59), he returned to the Indies archipelago in 1659 but was unable to return to Makassar that was under Dutch control. He was welcomed by Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa of Banten in 1659. In 1680, Ageng's son rose in rebellion against Syekh Yusuf at the behest of the Dutch. In 1683, Syekh Yusuf undertook guerilla warfare against the Dutch in Banten. By 1684, the Dutch promised to pardon Syekh Yusuf and persuaded him to surrender. But the former reneged on their promise. Consequently, Syekh Yusuf was imprisoned, initially in Batavia (1684) and was subsequently deported to Colombo (Ceylon). In 1693, Syekh Yusuf was exiled to the Cape, now in South Africa where he was instrumental in spreading Islam. He passed away during his exile in Cape province in 1699. 

Among Yusuf's first disciples, Makassarese and Buginese royal families predominated. He was known by the honorific title of at-Taj-al- Khalwati or the "" Crown among the Khalwatiya,"" amongst the Buginese and the Makassarese. Syekh Yusuf's spiritual techniques were syncretic and were heavily influenced by the Naqshbandiyya School of  Sufism that emphasizes silent Dhikr (a Sufi practice that emphasizes rhythmic repetition of the name of God). 

 

Syekh Yusuf's remains were repatriated to Gowa in 1705. The tomb of Syekh Yusuf (built ~ 1705) is located 500 meters to the west of the Katangka mosque. The total area of Masjid Katangka is 174.24 square meters. As per historical records, the mosque has undergone renovations at least seven times between 1603 and 1980. 

The Masjid Tua Katangka mosque was constructed in 1603, supposedly by Minangkabau cleric Daeng Bandang who succeeded in converting the Fourteenth Raja of Gowa Karaeng Matowaya Tumamenaga Ri Agamanna, reign between 1591-1629. The Fourteenth Raja of Gowa changed his name to Sultan Alauddin) after accepting Islam in 1605. 

The coming of Islam in South Sulawesi is linked to the "" Legend of the Three Datok,"" who were the muballigh or preachers. Muhammad Aldin Sila (2015), dates the arrival of the Three Datok in South Sulawesi to 1575 that coincided with the first period of Islamization of Gowa (1575-1605). The three Datok namely Datok Abdul Makmur (Datok Ri Bandang), Khatib Sulaiman (Datok ri Pattimang) and Khatib Bungsu ( Datok di Tiro) were believed to have converted the twin states of Gowa and Tallo to Islam (~1605).  The "" Legend of the Three Datok"" indicates the gradual Islamization of South Sulawesi. A salient feature of Islam in South Sulawesi was the blending of Islam with adat or tradition.

Datok Ri Bandang did not force the Makassar nobility to abandon their pre-Islamic customs soon after they embraced Islam such as bringing offerings to sacred places or the belief in Saukang (a stone or piece of wood considered ""sacred."" The finder of a Saukang was regarded as the temporary personfication of the pre-Islamic deity according to the Makassar nobility). 

Masjid Tua Katangka, the more popular appellation of Masjid Al-Hilal, is named after native Katangka trees (a deciduous tree endemic to South Sulawesi) that grew in abundance at the present site of the mosque. The scientific name of the Katangka tree, as listed in in Flora Malesiana is Millingtonia Hortensis. The Katangka was considered sacred by pre-Islamic Buginese and Makassarese and was priced for its fine-grained timber. The timber of the Katangka was initially used in the construction of the Katangka Old Mosque in 1603. 

The architecture of the mosque is an eclectic fusion of Javanese, Chinese, Arab and classical Greek styles. Cultural symbolism is apparent in the architecture. The four pillars of the mosque, reflect the blending of Javanese Joglo style of architecture with classical Greek influences. The Greek influence is evident in the cylindrical molding  of the pillars. The pillars collectively symbolize the four companions of Prophet Muhammad. Five doors, three inside and two outside symbolize the five tenets of Islam. There is a carving on the door leading up to the pulpit of the mosque in Arabic calligraphy but in the local Makassarese language. 


On the left and the right side of the pulpit, there are two spears. Local informants from Gowa note that at the turn of the seventeenth century, Islam in South Sulawesi was highly influenced by Animistic practices. Local Makassarese and Buginese would bite off edges of the Lontara (palm leaf manuscripts) from which Islamic sermons were read during Friday prayers. The locals at the time were of the conviction that such a practice would confer them immunity from enemies (Ashrawi Muin 2021).  To dispel animistic practices, the Gowa Sultan stationed two soldiers armed with spears. The two spears in turn, are symbolic of the Islamization of the principality of

The church in Viriatino was closed in 1933, and by the 1950s, many of the traditional religious beliefs and practices had been abandoned. Aspects of religion that were retained through state-sponsored secularization mainly related to marriage or treatment of the dead.

While there is little additional evidence concerning religion at Emar, the ritual corpus combined with a unique political situation warrants examination, even if such examination is brief due to a lack of evidence.

The vast majority of texts from Emar come from building M1, the so-called ""house of the diviner,"" so the data is skewed.

1304,Peyote Religion (Peyotism) and the Native American Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"Peyotism has ancient roots in the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica. Archeologists have found Peyote buttons in human stone dwellings carbon dated as early as 5000 BCE. This entry, however, focuses on the migration of the Peyote tradition to the US in the late nineteenth century and provides an account of the founding and development of the Native American Church (NAC) during the long twentieth century. This group's central ethos and religious practices revolve around traditional Peyote ceremonies and religion, but nearly every group incorporates Christian beliefs and moral teachings to varying degrees of prominence.  

Quanah Parker, a Comanche war chief, is largely credited as the most significant figure in the importation of Peyotism to the US. Towards the end of the 19th century, a bull gored Parker while he was traveling to Mexico to visit relatives. He fell extremely ill and nearly died due to complications with the wound. After failed attempts to heal Parker by Anglo doctors, a Mexican Indian healer had Parker consume a tea made from boiling a green cactus called Peyote. Parker healed shortly after that. Upon recovering, he asked the healer to teach him about the sacred properties of the plant and the rituals and traditions surrounding its consumption. She happily obliged.

After learning all that he could from the healer, Parker took his experience and what he learned about the peyote tradition back to the Comanche reservation in Oklahoma. From there, the religion spread rapidly among Indians in the Western plains, and in 1918 Oklahoma Peyotists organized the Native American Church (NAC) to promote ""the Christian religion with the practice of the Peyote Sacrament."" The NAC still exists today and boasts over a quarter million members; it is most prominent among the Navajo. In 1990 Peyotism would find itself at the center of a precedent-setting case about the limits of religious freedom in Oregon v. Smith.

Today, the NAC and other American Indian groups practice the Peyote religion in various parts of the US. Two primary forms of ceremonies involve the consumption of Peyote: (1) the Half Moon ceremony; (2) and the Crossfire ceremony. The Crossfire Way--first called the Big Moon Way--incorporates more Christian elements than the older, more traditional Half Moon Way. However, both contain Christian characteristics by the end of the 20th century. The character of Peyote Religion is largely a product of its historical context and the conflicts and controversies surrounding its proliferation. The following attempts to recount significant events and figures most significantly affected its trajectory and current modern form.",1875,2022,1600,732,James Waters,2022-02-21 18:30:50.964 +0100,2022-07-10 06:30:59.082 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1305,Three Tianzhu Monasteries 三天竺寺,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Three Tianzhu Monasteries 三天竺寺 represents three prominent Buddhist monasteries—the Upper Tianzhu Monastery 上天竺寺, Middle Tianzhu Monastery 中天竺寺, and Lower Tianzhu Monastery 下天竺寺—in southwest Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. In 595, the Southern Tianzhu Monastery 南天竺寺, the predecessor of the Upper and Lower Tianzhu monasteries, was built by the monk Zhenguan 真觀 (538-611). During the Wuyue 吳越 period (907-978), it was named as the Five-Hundred Arhats Cloister 五百羅漢院. Under the imperial edict, it was officially retitled as the Tianzhu Monastery 天竺寺in 1020, and the Tianzhu Monastery was divided into the Upper and Lower Tianzhu Monasteries in 1023. Together, these two monasteries were the center of Tiantai Buddhism in the Song time (960-1279). Famous Tiantai reformers, such as Ciyun Zunshi 慈雲遵式 (964-1032) and Nanping Fanzhen 南屏梵臻 (d.u.), had served as their abbots. 
	Being the home of the sandal white-robed Guanyin icon, since the middle of the 11th century, the Upper Tianzhu Monastery was widely believed as a domicile of Guanyin and became a famous pilgrimage site of Guanyin. In 1065, the title “Efficacious Guanyin” 靈感觀音 was conferred to the monastery by the Emperor Renzong of Song 宋仁宗 (r. 1022-1063). The marvelous efficacy of its Guanyin icon, in the names of the “White-robed Mahāsattva” 白衣大士 was further popularized through the poems of SU SHI 蘇軾 (1037-1101), an intimate friend of the monastery’s abbot Biancai Yuanjing 辯才元淨 (1011-1091). 
	The Middle Tianzhu Monastery was first built as a meditation courtyard 道場 by the legendary Indian monk Baozhang 寶掌 (?-657) in 597 and reconstructed as the Chongshou Cloister 崇壽院 by Qian Chu 錢俶 (929-988), the last emperor of the Wuyue Kingdom. In the Southern Song period (1127-1279), the monastery was renowned for its efficacious icon of the Bodhisattva Mārīcī 摩利支菩薩. Since the Song dynasty, the monastery is best known for its affiliation with the Chan tradition. Zongle 宗泐 (1318-1390), a close friend of Zhu Yuanzhang 朱元璋 (1328-1398) and a successful politician-monk, was trained and tonsured in the monastery and served as its abbot from 1368 to1371. At a similar time, the name Middle Tianzhu Monastery was officially granted to the monastery.
	Three monasteries all hosted the Southern Tours 南巡 of the Emperor Qianlong 乾隆 (r. 1736-1795), who also changed the names of the monasteries to Faxi Monastery 法喜寺 (Upper), Fajing 法淨寺 (Middle), and Fajing Monastery 法鏡寺 (Lower). Nowadays, the Upper Tianzhu Monastery has become a popular tourist site, the Middle Tianzhu Monastery is associated with the Hangzhou Buddhist Academy 杭州佛學院, and the Lower Tianzhu Monastery is a functioning nunnery.",595,2022,1455,727,Guanxiong Qi,2022-02-22 18:13:53.624 +0100,2022-04-20 05:30:26.118 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1306,Philistine Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Evidence for religious praxis in the Philistine culture of the Iron Age Southern Levant, based on archaeological finds, and some information from biblical literature and ancient near eastern texts. The Philistine culture appeared in the southern Coastal Plain (""Philistia"") of the southern Levant (modern Israel/Palestine) ca. 1200 BCE during the transition between the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. This culture is a combination of migrants from various regions in the eastern Mediterranean (with significant Aegean components), of various socio-economic backgrounds (including perhaps pirate groups), who settled in the Philistia alongside local Canaanites. Together, they formed a unique ""entangled"" culture, which combined attributes of various origins. This culture continued to exist in the region until ca. 600, when the last Philistine cities were destroyed by the Babylonians. The Philistine culture is well-known from excavations in the last century, at major cities such as Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron and Gath, and smaller sites such as Nahal Patish, Tel Qasile and Tel Yavneh. Important finds relation to cultic practices have been found at these sites, including public temples (Ekron, Gath, Patish and Qasile), domestic cult (Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron and Gath), and cultic repositories of various types (Gath, Qasile and Yavneh). The Philistine culture was not rich in written materials, and the small corpus of inscriptions from the Iron Age II (ca. 1000-600) is written in an alphabetic script, using a language similar to Phoenician, and contains minimal information on Philistine religion, including a few names of deities (e.g. Patgaiah, Baal), but very little other information. The Philistines are mentioned often in the Bible as neighbors and enemies of the Philistines, often in a negative manner. While the biblical texts may have been written, for the most part, later than the events they depict, they nevertheless seem to mirror the complex relationships that existed between the Israelites and the Philistines during the Iron Age.",-1200,-600,1456,995,Aren Maeir,2022-02-22 19:04:13.207 +0100,2022-02-24 04:49:08.039 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1307,Southern Baptists,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Southern Baptist Convention is an American Protestant Evangelical Christian Tradition formed in 1845. It is currently the largest Protestant denomination in the United States with a membership of 14 million adherents. It has historically emphasized evangelism, personal salvation, the authority of the Bible as the Word of God, and the autonomy of local churches.

The Southern Baptist Convention was originally formed in Augusta, GA in an effort to defend slavery (a view which has since been vehemently and retroactively condemned by the Southern Baptist Convention). In the 1980s, conservative Southern Baptists implement the “conservative resurgence” (alternatively called the conservative takeover by its detractors) in which they sought to return to a more traditional understanding of Christian beliefs and practices in response to a perceived drift towards mainline/liberal thinking. This resulted in liberal and moderate Baptists disassociating themselves and forming their own associations. Throughout their history, the Southern Baptist Convention have sought converts to Christianity domestically and abroad through missionary endeavors.  In 2010, Southern Baptists voted to be alternatively referred to as “Great Commission Baptists” due to their evangelistic emphasis and international presence. The most well-known Southern Baptist was Billy Graham (1918-2018) who was known for leading mass evangelism events around the world.

The Southern Baptist Convention describes itself as “a body of like-minded local churches cooperating together to reach the world with the Good News of Jesus Christ” (sbc.net). A central component of the Southern Baptist Convention’s mission is to “proclaim and minister the Gospel because the love of Christ compels us to do so. God’s call to us is to present the Gospel of Jesus to every person and to make disciples in every town, every city, every state, and every nation. The SBC is committed to sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with the whole world” (sbc.net). 

The foundation for contemporary Southern Baptists beliefs is the depiction of the Bible as the Word of God, which is also seen as the authoritative source for Christian beliefs and practices. Southern Baptists have also constructed a summary of their beliefs in a document called “The Baptist Faith and Message”, which represents a broad perspective on 18 topics dealing with theological, ethical, and cultural issues. Southern Baptist churches are not required to affirm or adopt this document, but it does represent a perspective that is widely held among Southern Baptists.

Southern Baptist entities include: SBC Executive Committee, International Mission Board, North American Mission Board, Lifeway Christian Resources, GuideStone Financial Resources, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, six Seminaries, and the Woman’s Missionary Union.",1845,2022,1538,1108,Nathaniel A.

1308,Jews and Jewish-Sympathizers in South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"Between 275 and 300, the South Arabian kingdom of Ḥimyar managed to subjugate the nearby kingdoms of Saba’ and Ḥaḍramawt, and unified the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The language of the ancient and renowned kingdom of Sabaʾ was chosen as the official language of the kingdom. All inscriptions dated after the fourth century are classified as Ḥimyarite.  In order to further culturally unify their subjects, the king of Ḥimyar Malkīkarib Yuha’min (reigned from about 375 to 400) converted to monotheism around 380. According to the fifth-century Ecclesiastical History by Philostorgius (d. ca. 439), a Christian religious mission of Theophilus the Indian (d. 364) took place in South Arabia after the kingdom’s unification. However, we do not possess any source other than Philostorgius claiming that “Theophilus persuaded the king to become Christian” in the fourth century. Two religious communities are in South Arabia during the fourth and fifth centuries. The local Jews influenced the ruling elites, which adopted a cautious form of monotheism which could be defined as “Jewish sympathizing”. In some respects, the god invoked by the South Arabian kings and princes resembles the ‘High God’ venerated in the Graeco-Roman world and in buffer-state regions such as the already mentioned Palmyra. Ḥimyar’s becoming monotheistic was a more gradual process than previously thought, a conclusion supported by the religious vocabulary employed in the monumental epigraphic corpus. The Ḥimyarite monotheistic inscriptions of the time contain three different titles to indicate a supreme monotheistic deity. The most common ones are: ’ln (“God,” also spelled ’lhn, ’lh, or ’’lhn), B‘l/Mr’ S1myn (“Lord of the Heaven,” sometimes “of Earth” is added), and Rhṃ nn (“Merciful”). Although these theonyms possess blurred connotations, around ten Ḥimyarite inscriptions point to the presence of Jews in late antique South Arabia. Some inscriptions mention “the People of Israel” (s2‘bn Ys3r’l), the Jews (Hd/Hwd/Yhd) or the formula “Owner of the Sky God of Israel” (B‘(l) S1myn ’lh Ys3r[’l]). We also possess an edict granting the construction of a Jewish cemetery. There are many Hebrew and Aramiac loanwords in these Ḥimyarite inscriptions. In addition to two Hebrew inscriptions have been found in South Arabia, a group of epitaphs found outside South Arabia can be also attributed to Jewish Himryarite emigrants. The Ḥimyarite kings’ choice to adopt a monotheism inspired by Judaism potentially had political implications, distancing Ḥimyar from Rome, Aksūm, and the surrounding federations of Arabia.",275,530,1458,1109,Valentina A.

1309,Circumcellions,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Circumcellions (sometimes called Agonistici) are a subgroup of Donatists in northern Africa in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. In general, Donatists are remembered for their rigorous stance on Christian clergy's baptismal and ethical practices, particularly in the wake of persecution, in order for their ministry and sacraments to be deemed valid. Donatists, including Circumcellions were primarily active around Carthage and spread throughout the broader North African province of the Christianized Roman Empire. This group believed, in the wake of Diocletian's persecution of Christians, that those who denied Jesus's lordship or repudiated Christian scriptures by handing them over to Roman authorities had given up the ability to function as leaders within North African Christian communities.

Augustine, Optatus, and Filastrius of Brescia comment on the Circumcellions as a more radical branch of Donatist thought and practice emerging from Numidia that were characterized by their opponents as being rural hooligans, local mobs, and inciters of violence. They first appear in written record in the early fourth century in Numidia, and seemed to have been a more vocal subgroup within Donatist thought regarding the importance of changing the material circumstances of Christians. They particularly took violent action against traffickers of enslaved people and local landlords. They are often remembered (sometimes incorrectly or polemically) for seeking out martyrdom through violence, and for provoking soldiers, travelers, and courts to hasten their death -- all of which complicated late ancient Christian discussions of what types of martyrdom were acceptable. Unfortunately, much of what is known about the Circumcellions comes via the writings of those who saw them as a threat, so it is difficult to tease out what is rhetorical and what is historical reality about the group. Additionally, Circumcellions were primarily rural Donatist Christians who took aim at urban Catholic Christians, providing evidence that some Christian beliefs and practices were split along geographic and demographic lines. Because of their rural center, Circumcellions were remembered as comparable to bandits and highwaymen because of how they purportedly harassed urban travelers and soldiers across North Africa. By the seventh century, the Circumcellions' reputation spread such that their name was associated with non-North African clerics whose opponents wanted to label them as dangerous.",315,500,526,754,Chance Bonar,2022-02-23 16:43:53.820 +0100,2022-03-09 03:04:20.711 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1310,"The byzantine cemetery-hermitage of Saint Onufrius (Onoufrios) in Methoni, south-western Messinia, Peloponnese, Greece)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Agios Onoufrios (Saint Onuphrius) is a rock-cut monumental complex  lying on a hill not far from the important medieval castle-town of Methoni (Modon), in the province of Messinia, in the Peloponnese region of south-western Greece. The complex was developed in part of a probably ancient limestone quarry that occupies the slope of the hill. The habitation pattern, that is a previously disused quarry eventually at some time re-occupied for funerary and religious-ascetic purposes, was widespread and common in the soft bedrock landscapes of south Mediterranean. 
Initially, Agios Onoufrios was formed as a fourth century CE cemetery that included rock-cut tombs, arched recesses purposed for entombment widely known as arcosolia (reminding catacomb formation, extremely rare in Greece), and shaft graves. Other rock-cut constructions such as niches and tables served for funerary-ceremonial purposes. Many centuries later, most probably from the 12th century CE, it was converted to a hermitic settlement. It was probably then and onwards when several modifications took place, in order for chapels and hermitages to be shaped. Alterations were made in the complex such as the construction of interior walls for the separation of the dwelling cells and the religious spaces such as chapels. Niches, apses, recesses were carved and murals were painted so as to cover the new religious needs. Also, channels of harvesting rainwater and storing cisterns were hewn for securing subsistence. As for the naming of the complex, there is a sole reference of the Montagna de San Nufrio in a Venetian document of 1386, supposedly named after a certain hermit Onoufrios that chose to occupy the abandoned site.",300,1500,1459,1112,Sophia Germanidou,2022-02-24 15:42:08.513 +0100,2022-11-08 23:45:51.456 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1311,Jehovah's Witnesses,43,Religious Group (v6),"The religious movement that would grow into the Jehovah’s Witnesses first coalesced in Pittsburgh in the 1870s around a young founder named Charles Taze Russell. Though previously disillusioned with religion, Russell was strongly influenced by Adventist ideas of Jesus’ imminent return. He began gathering friends and followers at a Bible Study and publishing a periodical called “Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence.” By the 1880s, Russell’s congregations had proliferated, and he had formally founded the organization that would become the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the guiding institution behind the Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

But the Jehovah’s Witnesses faced a prophetic challenge as a mounting number of revised dates that Russell continued to set for the apocalypse came and went without Christ’s tangible return. After another apparently failed prophecy in 1914, Witnesses began to argue that Jesus had indeed returned, but had done so invisibly, beginning a heavenly rule and ushering in the “last days” that will lead up to an imminent Battle of Armageddon. Soon, they believe, Jesus will purge the earth of sin and wickedness, creating a paradise. A small group of elite believers will rule over it with him, while the rest of the righteous will be reawakened to live eternally on the new earth. Nonbelievers will be punished with eternal death.

Because of their belief that the Apocalypse is imminent, Witnesses are hyper focused on proselytizing in their home communities and around the world. They do this through door-to-door outreach and by distributing literature in public places like train and subway stations. Through a tight organizational structure led by the Governing Body at a global level and elders at a congregational level, Jehovah’s Witness’ variations in practice, belief, and biblical interpretation are kept in check. Beyond their outreach efforts, Jehovah’s Witnesses are fairly insular, maintaining strong boundaries between insiders and outsiders. They are a relatively “high cost” religious group in terms of the demands they place on members’ time, energy, and autonomy. They also stand out from other Christian groups for their rejection of the trinity, as well as for their refusal to celebrate holidays, participate in politics or shows of patriotism, or receive blood transfusions. Over the last century, Jehovah’s Witnesses have often faced intense persecution around the globe.",1870,2022,1460,738,Joanna Smith,2022-02-24 16:29:06.053 +0100,2022-05-02 16:47:28.348 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1313,Masjid Tua Palopo,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Masjid Tua Palopo or the Palopo Old Mosque is a seventeenth century royal mosque located in the Indonesian city of Palopo, South Sulawesi that was a part of the erstwhile Buginese principality of Luwu until 1905. Palopo in the Buginese language etymologically refers to insertion of pegs in the holes of the pillar of buildings during construction. The word Palopo in itself describes the specific process of mosque construction.  

According to anthropologists and historians specializing on South Sulawesi, Luwu is in some ways central to understand the cultural history of South Sulawesi. Luwu was the most powerful kingdom in pre-Islamic South Sulawesi between the tenth and the fourteenth centuries. The Lontara ( Buginese palm-leaf manuscripts) claim that at the time petty principalities from South Sulawesi such as Selayar and Buli-Buli claimed that their first kings originally came from Luwu. 

South Sulawesi, particularly the principalities of Gowa and Makassar, were acquainted with Islam since at least the sixteenth century. At the time, Malay traders had settled on the Southwestern coast of Sulawesi. During the reign of Makassarese king Karaeng Tuni Pallangga (1546-65), Muslim traders from Champa, Patani, Pahang, Johor and West Sumatra secured several concessions in the port city of Makassar. At the turn of the seventeenth century, South Sulawesi was drawn into the maritime trading network that included Champa, Pattani, Aceh, West Sumatra, Banjarmasin, Giri and Ternate. Historians contend that Islamization in South Sulawesi dates to the Legend of the Three Datok. The Three Datok were Minangkabau muballigh or preachers from West Sumatra who succeeded in converting the local rulers to Islam. Historians contend that the expansion of Islam in South Sulawesi was gradual. Initially, until at least the turn of the seventeenth century, the Buginese principalities of Bone, Wajo and Soppeng rejected Islam. Oral tradition of the Buginese mentions that before the Three Datok arrived in Gowa, they reached the Buginese kingdom of Luwu and succeeded in converting the local ruler Datu Payung Luwu (the holder of Luwu's Umbrella) La Patiware Daeng Parabbung (also known as Sultan Muhammad after his conversion to Islam in 1604). Historians are uncertain about the duration of his reign (see also Andaya 1981). 

The Islamization of South Sulawesi kingdoms involved the blending of Islam with Adat (customary law) such that Islam was not seen as an alien belief. Datok Patimang, for example, drew parallels between the Islamic notion of Tauhid or Oneness of God with the Buginese notion of One God, Dewata Seuwae. 

Historians contend that the Three Datok chose Luwu for initially propagating Islam instead of the Buginese principalities of Bone or Wajo or the Makassarese kingdom of Gowa for two strategic reasons. First, Luwu was the cradle of Buginese nobility. Second, places mentioned in the Buginese epic I La Galigo were associated with the principality of Luwu. The conversion of the ruler of Luwu in turn, would pave way for the Islamization of South Sulawesi, more generally. 

The construction of Palopo mosque by Datok Patimang in 1604 was representative of the Islamic character of the Luwu principality. The mosque also indicated the shift of the Luwu capital from Malangke to Palopo. The latter was on the coast and was well-connected with coastal trade. A salient character of royal mosques in Indonesia, including the Palopo Old Mosque, is proximity of the mosque to the Luwu royal palace. The Old Mosque's architecture reflects a fusion of pre-Islamic Buginese and Islamic symbolism with Javanese architecture and embodies traces of Hindu-Buddhist and Chinese art. 

In accordance with Buginese cosmology, the Soko Guru Tunggal or the mosque's main pillar indicates Posi Bola or the central position of twelve Luwu Buginese clans and the center of the Luwu principality. The main pillar is also representative of the Buginese traditional house. From an Islamic perspective, the Soko Guru Tunggal represents individuals' relationship with God. Apart from the Soko Guru Tunggal, the mosque foundation is supported by four Soko Guru. The five Soko Guru represent the five commandments of Islam (profession of faith or shahada; prayer or salat; almsgiving or zakat; fasting during the Holy Month of Ramadan; and, Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca at least once during lifetime). The five Soko Guru also collectively represent Buginese Adat or Pangadereng. The five main pillars of Pangadereng include Wari (Order), Tuppu (Harmony), Rapang (History), Bicara (Written Law) and lastly, Adat anchored in Sara (Sharia or Islamic Law). 

The Old Mosque of Palopo has a rectangular layout. The three-layered Tajug roof structure is influenced by Javanese architecture. The roof structure incorporates Memolo decoration, symbolic of Mount Meru or Semeru of Hindu and Javanese cosmology that is considered to be the center of physical, spiritual and metaphysical universes. Above the apex of the roof, a blue ceramic jar is placed upside down. The inverted ceramic jar represents a Sufi theme: the unfathomability and oneness of God. From the perspective of  Islamic values, the three overlapping roof structures represent surrender to the will of God (Islam), faith (Iman), and Ihsan (perfection).Twenty large windows of the Old Mosque represent the twenty attributes of Allah. Ventilation of the mosque depicts the Bulu or Turtle analogy. Turtle represents humility. 

The walls and Soko Guru were constructed from locally available materials. The thickness of the walls is approximately three feet and were constructed out of a mixture of locally-quarried mountain stones, egg white mixture and lime. Locally available Cinna Guri hardwood (botanical equivalent unknown) was used in the construction of the Soko Guru. Lotus motifs, evident at the base of the wall of the old mosque, reflects Javanese Candi (Hindu-Buddhist shrine) art. 

The Mirhab (prayer niche in the west-facing Qiblah Wall facing Mecca) is influenced by the Candi architecture of ancient Java. 

The main gate of the mosque is shaped like a Makara, a mythical sea-animal (probably a crocodile according to Apte's Sanskrit Dictionary, published in 1957). The Makara is a distinct Javanese imprint on the Palopo Old Mosque's architecture. The Makara is a decorative and symbolic element of Hindu-Buddhist temple architecture of India and Java. As an aquatic creature although the Makara is an affirmative symbol producing life in its endless convolutions, the Makara as the mount (vahana) of river goddess Ganga epitomizes the destruction of life. The union of Makara and lion is depicted in ancient Indian and Javanese art. In the Hindu art of Indonesia, the joint figure is known as the Kala-Makara; the lion with its voracious nature, depicts the sun that consumes all things in its role as an instrument of time. In Indic thought,
Kala-the word for time-becomes a synonym for death and thus a designation of Yama or the Hindu god of death (Darian 1976).  

The rectangular shape of the Palopo Old Mosque is identical to the features of the Javanese Pendopo (a fundamental element unique to central Java). The Pendopo is a large pavilion-like structure built on four columns and provides ventilation and sunlight. The Pendopo symbolizes the equality amidst the congregation. 

A study of the Palopo Old Mosque indicates that the gradual Islamization of South Sulawesi did not affect local architectural styles. On the contrary, local architecture from the Indies archipelago blended with Islamic symbolism and influences from Java. A salient feature of royal mosques in the islands of Java and Sulawesi is tomb of the Sufi mystic behind the mosque, an Austronesian tradition, that reflects reverence for one's ancestors. What distinguishes the Palopo Old Mosque  from its counterparts in Java and Sulawesi is the position of the tomb. Near the pulpit of the Old Mosque lies the tomb of the architect Fung Man Te (possibly of Chinese descent), who assisted Datok Patimang in mosque construction. On the contrary, the tomb of Datok Patimang is located in the town of Malangke.",1604,1905,1462,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-02-25 20:06:39.549 +0100,2022-05-02 08:00:25.894 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1318,"The byzantine church of Prophet Ilias (Elijah), in Abysoles, Thalames, messinian Mani, Greece",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of Prophet Ilias (Elijah) is located close to a modern-day cemetery, in the area of Abysoles, at the village of Thalames, in the messinian province of  Mani peninsula, Peloponnese, in south-western Greece. The building is modest in dimensions (5,3 x 4,5 m), constructed with large quantities of poros blocks, set in bands, partly interlaced with single lines of bricks. Rubble masonry is used for the lower parts of the church. The church belongs to a rare architectural type, identified with several terms: “single- aisle with truncated dome and external appearance of a cross-in-square- inscribed”, “single-aisle barrel vaulted basilica with a dome”, “cross-vaulted church with a dome”, “truncated cross-in-square inscribed with arms of unequal width”. The type is being acknowledged as a transitional form between the truncated cross-in-square and the traverse vault churches or just a product of experimentations of both types. 
The interior was originally entirely covered with murals. The largest part of the decoration has fallen off, while the remaining paintings have suffered severe damages. The conch of the apse is adorned with the figure of Prophet Elijah, and the dome of the Christ Pantocrator's bust. Other figures and scenes include the Annunciation, prelates, Life of saint Demetrios, female saints. Murals combine iconographic and stylistic features that evoke both a progressive and a conservative character and they are probably dated at the end of the 13th - early 14th century.

1319,Reginistas,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Reginista movement is a New Religious Movement that follow Antonio Velazco Piña's best-selling novel ""Regina. Dos de Octubre no se olvida"" as the basis for their believe system and organization. The Movement was officially formed when, after publishing the novel, Antonio Velasco Piña appointed seven women to start the “First Circle of Regina”. The seven women, gathered in Aldea de los Reyes to commemorate Reginas sacrifice on October 2. Each of them, made the promise to recruit seven new women (total 49 new women) next year to make their circle bigger. 
In the fictional novel, Regina, the main character has a unique life. She lives in several countries (Tibet, China, Mexico) where she is trained by different spiritual teachers. In the book, this messianic character, who through her journey discovers her mission to “awaken” the energy of Mexico, which is believed to have been disrupted after the Spanish Conquest. Regina decided to go back to Mexico to find out how she can complete her spiritual mission. On her return, she encounters Mexico’s social unrest. It is in this part of the narrative, where fiction and history are entangled. The student movement of 1968 is where the author positions Regina’s final mission: not just to awaken Mexico’s energy, but to awaken the female energy of the country. In her meditations, Regina founds that the only way to achieve her goal is to commit self-sacrifice. With a group of followers and Indigenous teachers, she marches on October second, knowing she, and her followers would be assassinated. 
“Regina. Dos de octubre no se olvida” has been a controversial novel in Mexico. On one hand, it created the religious movement of the “Reginistas” or “reginas”, but on the other, it re-narrates a historical event in Mexican history to de-politicize the event in order to “spiritualized” it. Another controversial event is that Antonio Velasco Piña named her character Regina Teuscher, after one of students that died and whose photo appeared in the national press after the Tlatelolco Massacre. The family members from Regina Teusche confronted Antonio Velasco Piña in a book presentation. However, followers of the novel defend Velasco Piña’s narrative as real and do not separate fiction from reality. 
The ""reginistas"" (community members of the movement) gather at least once a year on October second to commemorate the self-sacrifice of Regina, as based on the fictional novel. This annual ritual takes place between Aldea de Los Reyes (2 hours away from Mexico City) and Tlatelolco, the neighborhood in Mexico City where the 1968 student massacre occurred. In Aldea de Los Reyes, the ritual is a night vigil with rituals, songs, and dances (the “reginistas” have created their own dance that is believed to be a combination of Conchero and Tibetan dances). Food is shared at dawn, and a committed then is sent to Tlatelolco to lay down the main offering made during the night with flowers. Since Tlatelolco is protected by the INAH (Mexican Institute of Anthropology and History), “reginistas” request a permit in advance to enter the area, but when not granted they leave the offering outside of the site. 
In addition to the annual ritual, “reginistas” also participate in “sacred walks” around Mexico City that are meant to “awaken” Mexico’s energy. These walks are organized by older reminisces and the dates for the walks and the map with a guided walk is usually shared through their personal emails or social media. There are two general routes around the city, one that corresponds to the masculine energy and one that corresponds to the femenine energy. For “reginistas”, they main objective is to finish the tasks that Regina herself was not able to complete. 
Because of the nature of the book, this religious movement is syncretic, mixing belief systems, practices, and material culture from Indigenous Mesoamerica, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Theosophy. The “Regina” movement is a good example of the Mexican New Age, where all these religions collude to form one movement with a nationalistic ideology. Most of the women that joined the “reginista” movement were practitioners of other “non-tradition” (Catholicism is the most practiced religion in Mexico) religious affiliations. Some of them were part of the Conchero Movement (an Indigenous Dance that mixes Catholic belief and Indigenous ritual), The Gran Fraternidad Universal -Universal Great Brotherhood- (which follows New Age belief and incorporated yoga practice), and Theosophy. Although most of the women (and Men) in the “reginista” movement grew up Catholic, there any connection to Catholicism is through the syncretic images used (like the Virgin of Guadalupe). 
Since the 2020 covid Pandemic, some of the oldest members have passed away, including the writer of “Regina. Dos de Octubre no se olvida”. This is a small movement that is always surprising historians and anthropologists. With Velasco Piña’s passing, some of the main leadership got disappeared, and although it seemed this may be the indication of the movement dyeing, a Mexican production announced in 2022 they are working on Regina, the movie.",1968,2022,1468,1121,Yanitsa BuendiadeLlaca,2022-03-04 20:00:55.184 +0100,2022-04-27 03:37:13.482 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The building shares features of ottoman and post-byzantine architecture such as the portico, the eight-sided dome, the mihrabs, the minaret, the islamic arches. It is square in ground plan, with four large pillars carrying the central  dome, and four barrel vaults that radiate

1321,Mourides (Muridiyya),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mouride tariqa (brotherhood) is headquartered in Ṭūbā, in north-central Senegal, the site of Amadu Bamba Mbaké's 1890s vision of the angel Gabriel and the location for the brotherhood’s Grand Magal, an annual pilgrimage that attracts as many as two million devotees. The brotherhood grew out of the Qādiriyya (Xaadir) tariqa, a Ṣūfī movement to which Bamba was himself an adherent. Three distinctive features mark the Mourides. First, their devotion to their order's founder, Amadu Bamba, mirrors the level of veneration often reserved by Muslims for the Prophet Muhammad. Second, their adherence to the principle of hard works makes them ideally suited for agrarian life in the Senegalese countryside. Third, their commitment to principled Islamic nonviolence, even during decades of resistance to French colonial overlords, has much to do with the emergence of Senegal as a nascent West African democracy in a region often beset by civil wars. Bamba's influence cannot be overstated. Mouride Wolof believe that by serving Bamba's vicegerents they participate in the blessing (baraka) of their founder and find a path to eternal life. A suborder of the Mourides, the Baye Fall, was initiated by a close disciple of Bamba’s, Ibrahima Fall, who continued his predecessor’s emphasis on the virtue of hard work. Other principles that are important to Mourides include mild asceticism, charity toward the order, filial devotion, Arabic and Islamic education, faith in the Hereafter, communal solidarity, the repetition of  God’s names (dhikr), and the Grand Magal, an annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Touba.",1853,2022,382,750,Tasi Perkins,2022-03-05 21:02:33.910 +0100,2022-05-19 18:56:40.556 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1322,Pagans under the Emperor Julian,43,Religious Group (v6),"Practitioners of traditional, indigenous, and non-Abrahamic religions and mystery cults under the Roman Empire, even during the brief reign of Julian (r. 361-363), were hardly a unified group, except in the mind of the emperor himself and his circle of intellectual elites. Although the term ""pagan"" originated as a Christian pejorative for non-Christian gentiles, it is more adequate than either ""polytheist,"" which excludes non-Abrahamic monotheists, or ""traditionalist,"" which erases groups that are relatively more recent than the familial and state cults of, for instance, Athens or Rome, i.e. Mithraists and Manichaeans. Individuals’ participation in religious practices, moreover, is not always consistent with inner convictions that are usually impossible to discern. 

Julian's religious beliefs and policies, nevertheless, attempted to integrate the rich diversity of Roman pagans into a single, artificial category in contradistinction to Christianity, which he regarded as an anti-religion, tantamount to atheism, that worshiped corpses rather than gods. Julian saw legitimate religions, Judaism included, as necessarily tied to ethnicity and geography. The ""ethnic god"" of each polis or ethnos accounted for their essential characteristics, e.g. the Romans were descended from Mars and so were warlike, while the Athenians inherited their philosophical tendencies from Athena. Julian called the Christians by the demonym ""Galileans"" in order to deny the religion's universality and restrict it to the ethnos of Jesus. As pontifex maximus and Hellenic Neoplatonist, the emperor not only treated Roman culture and religion as “from beginning to end, Greek;” he also placed all cults throughout the empire under his purview in a syncretic and henotheistic manner: every ethnic god was an emanation of the supreme god, which the emperor identified with the sun-god Helios. Basing his theology on the Neoplatonism of the Syrian Iamblichus of Chalcis, Julian’s Helios manifested itself in a triune hierarchy: at the top was Helios the King of All (pambasileus), which is “beyond being,” source of all being, and equal to the Plato’s Form of the Good and the One of Plotinus; King Helios (basileus) occupies the middle rank, the father of the gods and creator of the cosmos identified with Zeus and Plato’s Demiurge; lowest is the visible Sun, the conduit of Helios’ blessings upon the sensible cosmos. Julian and his inner circle also drew from Iamblichus the conviction that contact and spiritual union with Helios and the other gods cannot be achieved through intellectual contemplation (theoria) alone; divine blessings must be secured suprarationally through ritual practices such as prayer and blood sacrifice, while mystical ascent can be achieved only through the “hieratic art” of theurgy, in which the celebrant made suitable through purification participates in the “god-work” (theourgia) that sustains and renews the cosmos. In Julian’s quasi-ecclesiastical vision of ecumenical paganism, theurgists functioned as high priests over provincial congregations of local cults, and organized philanthropic relief of the poor and sick in competition with Christian charity. 

Although generally supportive of the emperor’s program of temple reconstruction, religious toleration, and redirection of imperial subsidies back to traditional cults, very few of the empire’s pagans shared their emperor’s radical vision. While the Iamblichean school of theurgic Neoplatonism persisted into the sixth century among pagan elites such as Proclus and Damascius at the Athenian Academy, in Julian’s day it was represented by a minority of philosophers. Even the majority of Neoplatonists were heirs more to Plotinus and Porphyry, who valued rational contemplation above ritual practice, and especially rejected blood offerings. Likewise, animal sacrifice had already been falling out of fashion by the fourth century, such that toothless prohibitions by Christian emperors such as Constantius II caused little trouble and did not extend to offerings of incense or cakes.

On a political level, Julian’s ideological polarization of Christianity versus a united front of paganism rarely corresponded to reality. While the Altar of Victory that Constantius had removed from the Curia was restored under Julian, the largely traditionalist Roman Senate had not supported Julian’s revolt against Constantius, while the army’s initial choice of Julian’s coreligionist Salutius to succeed the dead emperor in 363, which Salutius refused such that the Christian Jovian was elevated instead, suggests that an emperor’s personal religious affiliation was not so high a priority. It is telling of general attitudes at the time that the pagan soldier turned historian who served in that fateful Persian campaign, Ammianus Marcellinus, praised Julian highly for his military and political virtues, but largely criticized his zealous religious policies, such as his extravagant slaughter of sacrificial animals and edict forbidding Christians from serving as public school teachers. Although Julian did not violently persecute Christians, he nevertheless resembled the likes of Decius and Diocletian in that his divisive rhetoric of militant paganism largely clashed with the tolerant attitudes of the vast majority of the empire’s citizens, to a similar degree as the fulminations of Christian bishops such as Ambrose and John Chrysostom did not reflect the feelings of most Christians toward their pagan compatriots. The lynching of one such bishop in Alexandria, George of Cappadocia, by a pagan mob inspired by Julian’s accession in 361, should therefore not testify to pagans’ general attitudes towards Christians during his reign. 

In sum, the brevity of Julian’s 18-month career as sole Augustus precluded any potential success, and thus had little effect on the continuity or discontinuity of traditional practices in communities and households, which were largely maintained as a matter of civic pride and duty to ancestors. The pace of conversion to Christianity accelerated as much for its social and political opportunities as the religion of the new establishment as for its promises of spiritual reward on earth and in heaven.",361,363,132,1055,Jeremy Swist,2022-03-07 19:33:08.468 +0100,2022-03-07 19:35:44.812 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1323,Luguru,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Luguru (preferred name “Waluguru”) reside in the Uluguru Mountains in what is now the United Republic of Tanzania. This entry focuses on the Luguru around the time of 1925, during which time control of the region was transitioning from the recently dissolved German Empire to the United Kingdom. One of the main sources of information for this entry (Scheerder and Tastevin, 1950) is written in French, and while English translations are provided for some specific quotes, the work in its entirety remains untranslated. French to English translations were obtained through Google Translate and reviewed by a native French speaker. At the time focus of this entry, the Luguru were organized into 50 exogamous and matrilineal clans that lived in densely populated villages. These matrilineages played an important part in the traditional Luguru religion: lineage leaders could also perform the tasks of religious leaders, and lineage ancestors were considered sacred and propitiated. In addition to lineage leaders, the Luguru recognized other religious leaders including rainmakers and diviners, who were in charge of ceremonies and the propitiation of supernatural beings. The Luguru believed in both a supreme high god (mulungu) and ancestral spirits although most religious practices were devoted to the latter. For example, during naming ceremonies, one could take the name of a lineage ancestor, thereby inviting the spirit into their body. The more names one had, the more prestige they held, and could take on special tasks such as communicating with ancestral spirits. For the Luguru, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1910,1935,1470,1090,Anj Droe,2022-03-08 17:44:20.621 +0100,2022-06-01 16:38:14.491 +0200,eHRAF
1324,Taiping jing,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Taiping jing was compiled in the late 6th century by Daoist practitioners who were close to the Upper Clarity (shangqing 上清) group whose basis was at Mount Mao (Maoshan 茅山), in Jurong County 句容市 of Jiangsu Province. Due to linguistic and doctrinal reasons, most scholars agree it originated in the late second century CE. It consists of roughly three textual layers. The bulk, layer A, is an account of meetings between a heaven-sent Celestial Master (tianshi 天師) and a group of at least six students who have travelled from elsewhere to be instructed. They discuss the urgent need to actively promote universal great peace so as to prevent the approaching cataclysm that threatens the end of humankind and, in consequence, heaven and earth. The main topic is the need for widespread moral reforms. Regarding philosophical intention and terminology, layer A has parallels in Han dynasty (206 BCE- 220 CE) socio-political thought. Layer B contains conversations between a disciple and members of the celestial bureaucracy who discuss the chances for a career in the celestial bureaucracy. The disciple aims to turn immortal, which became the primary content of Daoist religious instruction. Layer C contains religious materials, in the form of talismans (fu 符) or reiterated characters (fuwen 複文), images and short Upper Clarity passages; it also includes a brief summary of layer A; several sections, composed in layer A style, propose positions divergent from those expressed in layer A.   
The 6th-century text was organised in ten divisions (bu 部), 170 chapters (juan 卷) and 366 sections. Simultaneous to the compilation, it was accepted into the Daoist Canon (Daozang 道藏). Due to the Canon's spurious transmission, parts of the Taiping jing were lost so that the text we have today has 57 chapters. It relies on the Canon that was printed in 1445. A manuscript preserved in Dunhuang (S 4226) contains the full table of contents of the 6th-century text. The 9th-century Taiping jing chao (Digest of the Taiping jing 太平經鈔), in ten divisions, consists of excerpts from the full 6th-century text. We can draw conclusions from these two sources regarding parts of the 6th-century text that have not been transmitted.
For the four hundred years between the supposed origin of much of the Taiping jing and the creation of the transmitted text, there is hardly any evidence for the text's existence. Throughout the Han dynasty, the term great peace was widely used. Historical sources mention that in the outgoing first century BCE and again in the mid-second century CE, texts with great peace in their title were presented to emperors but did not find acceptance. These texts may have had some impact. Whether the second one, titled Taiping qingling shu (Book on great peace with the title written in blue 太平清領書), played a role in the Yellow Turban rebellion of 184 CE is under debate. The Yellow Turbans were originally the Great Peace Movement (Taiping dao 太平道) that had started well over a decade earlier. Daoist hagiographic sources, followed by a number of scholars, depict the second of these texts on great peace as the original version of the Taiping jing that entered the Daoist Canon. It was written by Gan Ji 干吉, an expert in vitality techniques (fangshi 方士) in the region of Langya 琅琊 in the southeast of today’s Shandong province and presented to Emperors Shun 顺 (r. 125-144) and Huan 桓 (r.147-168). In 166 BCE, the scholar-official Xiang Kai 襄楷 travelled from Langya to the court to present the text and two memorials in its praise that official historical accounts have preserved. While there is no way to prove any material link between the Taiping qingling shu and the received Taiping jing, it is not impossible that layer A and layer B materials of the received text originated in the environment and at the time when Gan Ji and Xiang Kai were active.",150,2022,1132,1102,barbara hendrischke,2022-03-08 23:08:08.365 +0100,2022-03-31 20:06:19.037 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1326,Meher Kapısı inscription (Urartian text),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Meher Kapısı is a monumental rock carved niche located four kilometres north east of Van Kalesi, the site of the Urartian capital of Tušpa. Inside the niche a cuneiform text was carved, which defines the Urartian pantheon and sets ritual instructions. The text contains a long list of deities, starting with Ḫaldi. The head of the Urartian pantheon is followed by Teišeba, the weather god, and Šiuini, a solar deity. After the triad of the most important gods worshipped across the Urartian state, the text contains a long list of names, many of which are otherwise unknown deities. For each listed god there are instructions regarding the type and number of animals to be sacrificed during a yearly ritual. The text also mentions the gods of certain cities, without giving their names, and the gods of the lake and of the valley. 

Urartu developed from a series of small chiefdoms spread out on the Armenian Plateau, and had its capital established by Sarduri I on the eastern shores of Lake Van during the mid 9th century BCE. From what today is the modern city of Van, the royal dynasty created by Sarduri ruled until the first half of the 6th century BCE. At one point the main antagonist of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Urartian territories stretched from Lake Sevan to the southern shore of Lake Urmia, and as far West as the sources of the Euphrates. Mostly known for their metalwork and their fortifications, Urartians had a well established religion with Ḫaldi at the head of the pantheon. Although most Urartian temples and inscriptions are dedicated to him,  the Meher Kapısı inscription shows a more complex picture, with dozens of gods being worshipped across the territories of the ancient state.",-820,-580,1473,1011,Dan Socaciu,2022-03-09 15:36:27.926 +0100,2022-04-21 14:31:12.468 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1327,Tomb of Sunan Gresik,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Since the nineteenth century, Syekh Maulana Malik Ibrahim (1359-1419), known variously as Syeik Maghribi, Sunan Gresik or Syek Ibrahim as- Samarkandi is regarded as the first among the Wali Songo. The Wali Songo refers to the nine Sufi saints who introduced Islam to Java during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (Sunyoto 2017).



The discovery of the fifteenth century tombstone of Syekh Maulana Malik Ibrahim during the nineteenth century, elevated him to the status of Wali Songo. Babad Diponegoro was the first Javanese Babad to include Maulana Malik Ibrahim within the category of Wali Songo. Syekh Siti Jenar is sometimes included in the category of Wali Songo but sometimes his historical existence is denied due to controversy as he was the only pantheist among the Sufi saints of Java (Gil 2014). 

Each of the Wali Songo has a recognized tomb attached to a mosque and is a site for local pilgrimage or ziarah. Pilgrim visits occur at specific times, dictated by intersections of cycles of the Javanese calendar. Each saint of the Wali Songo is related to other members of the council either through genealogy or the master-apprentice relationship.  

Sunan Gresik was born in Samarkand (now in Uzbekistan) in 1359. By the time he was twenty, he was trained as a physician (Nourse 2013). Timur Lang's bullying tactics contributed to his migration to the Champa Kingdom (a collection of  kingdoms that controlled parts of the coast of modern day Vietnam). At Vijaya, the then capital of the Champa kingdom, he succeeded in curing the king's illness. The King of Champa offered his daughter in marriage as a reward for Sunan Gresik's cure. Legend states that the Champa King subsequently converted to Islam (Nourse 2013). In 1404, Sunan Gresik and his Champa wife sailed to the north coast of Java and settled near the Gresik harbor. Sunan Gresik's son from his Champa wife was Raden Rahmat, popularly known as Sunan Ampel according to Babad Ngampeldenta (Sunyoto 2017). 


In Java, Sunan Gresik's medical skills led to his sanctification as Wali Gresik. His skills as a physician attracted followers from the inland Hindu-Buddhist  kingdom of Majapahit. As with most Islamic physicians  of his time, Sunan Gresik belonged to a secret Sufi brotherhood Kubrawiyya Tariqa (Nourse 2013). The Kubrawiyya Tariqa was led by Syaikh Jumadil Kubra. Kubra taught that one could perceive Allah's healing essence as a glowing light (Nourse 2013). 




Over several generations, Sunan Gresik's descendants positioned themselves through strategic marriages with Javanese nobility and centralized power through control over sacred mystical knowledge (Nourse 2013). 

Dutch scholar J.P. Moquette notes from Sunan Gresik's tomb stone marker with an Arabic inscription that states [translated into English] :

"" This is the grave of Maulana Malik Ibrahim who passed away on Monday, 12 Rabi'ul Awwal, 812 Hijrah [date corresponding with April 7, 1419 of the Gregorian Calendar]. Exalted teacher of the princes and friend of the poor and destitute, he sacrificed his life for the cause of Islam. Maulana Malik Ibrahim, is originally from Kashan [Persia]. May Allah shower His mercy and grant him a place in paradise."" 

The tomb of Sunan Gresik is situated less than 200 meters from the Gresik town square in the area of Desa Gapura. Sheltered by a Pendopo (Javanese Pandhapa), the tomb of Sunan Gresik reflects the imprint of Javanese architecture. The Pendopo is a large pavilion-like structure supported by columns and is rectangular in plan.

1329,Pre-Pottery Neolithic in the Near East,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Pre-Pottery Neolithic group assemblage refers to the communities that settled in the early Holocene territories of Southwest Asia from about the 10th millennium until the middle of the 7th millennium. These Neolithic groups are primarily spread across the area known as the Fertile Crescent, i.e., the Levant, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia. Among the most significant socio-economic developments of this prehistoric transition are the construction of permanent public structures and monuments, the intensive cultivation of plants and animals (some of which become domesticated), and the establishment of domestic modes of food production. Communities begin to be less nomadic and more sedentary, establishing a more robust and extensive network of social relationships based on trade and the exchange of goods, social practices, and ideas. These developments are generally classified into two chronological phases: the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), which lasts from approximately 9700 to 8600 BCE, and the last phases of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, the PPNB-C, which begins in 8500 and lasts until 6600 BCE. Many of the social transformations that characterized this prehistoric period occur in the PPNB, such as the emergence of a series of large settlements, the adoption of agro-pastoral activities, and the construction of compartmentalised rectilinear structures. Finally, one of the most prominent features of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic is the formation of built environments rich in figural representations and symbols dedicated to ritual practices, socialisation, and perhaps religious performances. On many occasions, ritual forms are related to burials as in the case of the detachment, manipulation, and decoration of human skulls.",-9700,-6600,1476,1115,Mattia Cartolano,2022-03-11 11:17:47.805 +0100,2022-03-11 18:17:15.929 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1330,Papyrus Amherst 63,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Papyrus Amherst 63, also known as the “Mystery Papyrus,” has been an enigma for quite some time. It is a large text, with a total of 23 columns.  The text is also diverse in its content. There are not any prohibitions or legal literature in this corpus. It seems to be a collection of literature – prayers, poems, hymns, psalms, blessings, and it concludes with a literary tale about the seventh-century revolt of Shamash-shum-ukin of Babylonia against his brother, Assurbanipal of Assyria.  There is a reference to the worship of various gods such as Mar, Anat, Bethel, Ba’al, and Adonai. There are hymns that are dedicated to the Jewish God YHWH or Adonai, the Babylonian goddess Nanay, and to various other Semitic deities.  This collection of deities represents the religious ideologies of the Aramaic-speaking communities of the Babylonians, Syrians, and Jews, at the very least. The diversity incorporated in the text is only the beginning of its complexity. This document was purchased by Lord Amherst at the end of the 19th century and now resides in The Morgan Library in New York City. This papyrus' provenance is ancient Egypt. It was found in a jar outside of Thebes but is thought by some to originate around Elephantine and Aswan. Considering it was written in Egypt, it is not surprising that the script is Demotic, the penultimate phase of the Egyptian language and in regular use for legal, economic texts, as well as correspondence and literature. Considering the various cultures that resided in Egypt, it is also not surprising that texts in the Aramaic language were produced. The most surprising thing about this papyrus is that it is written in Demotic script while the language is Aramaic. The context of production is relatively unknown. Some have suggested that it was produced in the context of the community. It is also possible that a professional scribe was hired to compose this text in the Demotic script.  While this text has not received a great amount of attention there is one part of the content that drew a great deal of interest in the mid-1980s. It was discovered that col. XII 11–19 is a psalm that parallels Psalm 20 in the Hebrew Bible. This became a focal point of publications. Many articles written concerning this section look at the possibility of this text having the original version of the psalm. While that has been inconclusive, both this text and psalm 20 probably draw from the same original. This papyrus is still understudied and is starting to receive more attention from scholars.",-399,-100,1411,1099,Stephen Ward,2022-03-11 14:01:28.557 +0100,2022-05-17 12:46:47.699 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

In the past, Nikolaos Papachatzis had interpreted the deity as “Aphrodite of the Dead”.

1332,Temple of ʿAthtar dhū-Qabḍ,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This imposing religious edifice was built in the late 5th century BCE in the sacred area within the ancient South Arabian urban site of Yathill (now uninhabited and known as Barāqish, present-day Yemen). It was dedicated to the god ʿAthtar dhū-Qabḍ, supreme deity of the Minaeans, the people who inhabited the Jawf valley of ancient Yemen during the first millennium BCE and who also occupied this settlement from the 6th century onward. This temple was built later than the adjoining one dedicated to the god Nakraḥ, with which it shares some design elements, such as the entrance staircase, the imposing propylaeum made of monolithic pillars more than six meters high, a hypostyle room divided into five naves and here organized into four inner cenacles. However, the differences are also significant: the adyton here features a central cella with two large accessory rooms on either side, and it is also possible that there was an upper floor, which made this building sensibly bigger than the adjoining one.
Although the temple has been reused since antiquity, partly collapsed and then also heavily looted, the excavations made it possible to appreciate the grandeur of its layout and the refinement of its interior furnishings, as for the four decorated offertory tables placed inside the cenacles. The first reuse occurred shortly after the end of the Minaean kingdom, around the first century CE, by the Arabian Amīr tribe, who nevertheless continued to use the temple for religious purposes, rededicating it to their god Ḥalfān. Excavations have unearthed dozens of inscriptions written in ancient Minaic, a South Arabian language of the Semitic phylum, as well as a few other pieces written in Sabaic, esp. in the Amiritic variety.
The area of this building was occupied continuously for different purposes from the early Islamic period until the 17th-18th centuries CE, when the site was abandoned indefinitely.",-600,100,1616,1126,Alessio Agostini,2022-03-12 10:20:24.292 +0100,2022-07-31 19:16:59.943 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1333,Cult of Thecla,43,Religious Group (v6),"The cult of Thecla was a widespread and popular devotion to Saint Thecla, reportedly a follower of Paul the Apostle. The foundational text of this report is the Acts of (Paul and) Thecla, a second century Greek story about the young virgin Thecla who renounces her betrothed in order to live a life of sexual abstinence. As the story goes, Thecla survived multiple attempts by the local authorities of public execution, making her a model of eventual martyrdom ideologies. Though some Christians thought the tale a forgery (notably Tertullian), in the third to seventh centuries devotion of Thecla spread across the Mediterranean, rivaling devotion to Mary the mother of Jesus. From Syria to Africa, Greece, and Spain, reverence to Thecla consisted of shrines, catacombs, churches and pilgrimages dedicated to her. While reverence to Thecla as a saint continues today, late antiquity was the high point of such adherence.

The types of people who participated in the cult of Thecla varied dramatically. Evagrius Scholasticus of the sixth century, for instance, records in his Ecclesiastical History that the fifth century emperor Zeno had a vision of Thecla, who encouraged him to march on Byzantium to reclaim his throne, which he did. Afterwards, Zeno had a church built to Thecla in Seleucia, home of a center of Theclan cultic activity. One of the functions of shrines, however, was to provide shelter to pilgrims, who both gave offerings and received sustenance. This cultic economy necessitates involvement from both those wealthy and powerful enough to act as benefactors to the cult (such as in the construction of the shrines themselves) and those of the (majority) poor who sought out the shrines to pay homage to the saint, hoping to receive blessings in return. As described by the fourth century pilgrim Egeria, the cult complex in Seleucia had “innumerable monastic cells of men and of women,” with a head deaconess overseeing the virgins housed there.

Personal piety was also a major factor of the cult, which can be difficult to track for the majority of people. Items such as flasks or combs with engravings of Thecla are abundant, along with paintings and reliefs of scenes from the Acts of (Paul and) Thecla, as most notably evident in the Catacomb of Thecla (Rome) and the chapel at El Bagawat (Egypt). Famous Christians such as Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus extolled Thecla as a moral exemplar, the latter even temporarily relocating to the shrine in Seleucia. This reverence reflected the concern for the body in some Christian circles, emphasizing the imperative of sexual purity, if not outright abstinence. It is implausible to imagine these kinds of moral ideologies belonged to the elite (for which have the most evidence) alone. Given Tertullian’s early negative disposition against the Acts of Thecla for the baptismal authority it seemed to grant women, it is no surprise that women in particular found power in the character of Thecla who defied the men of her life (even Paul!) to live an exemplary (chaste) Christian life.",150,600,1487,722,Ryan Fitzgerald,2022-03-12 18:30:02.857 +0100,2022-05-11 18:30:25.993 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1334,No-debt Movement in US Evangelicalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Financial crises and economic recessions over the past few decades have given rise to the no-debt movement in both religious and non-religious spaces. Many evangelicals in the United States, in particular, have embraced the no-debt movement that emphasizes debt elimination, financial stewardship, and generosity. Financial ministries such as Crown Financial Ministries and Dave Ramsey Solutions have become an integral part of the religious landscape as they provide resources, seminars, and curriculum to churches to help congregants get out of debt and generate wealth. The leaders of these ministries, in addition to pastors and church leaders, work to weave theology into financial practices to help adherents view debt through a theological lens. 

The no-debt movement is not only evangelical in its theology but also reflects American values and culture of freedom and agency. Although there has also been an increase of non-religious no-debt organizations and leaders who promote similar practices as evangelical no-debt leaders, the evangelical no-debt movement adds a theological lens into the American financial experience that provides adherents with new language and new practices. Debt is viewed as a form of slavery and adherents of the no-debt movement use various biblical texts to support their position. The only appropriate response to debt is to attack it until it is gone. This means that many people in the no-debt movement adjust their financial lifestyles in order to aggressively pay off debt. 

In addition to the aversion of debt, the evangelical no-debt movement promotes the concept of stewardship and generosity. Stewardship is the belief that God created everything and things like money, assets, and wealth belong to God, not the person. God entrusts people to manage assets like money and they are responsible for stewarding God’s money well. Excessive consumer debt is a sign that a person has not been a good steward of what God has given them and thus they need to make changes in their thinking and actions in order to get in line with God’s way of handling finances. Once a person is out of debt they are able to become more effective stewards of God’s provision because they can now be generous with what God has given them. Many adherents of the no-debt movement promote generosity as one of the ultimate goals of financial freedom. God give people money and wealth so they can steward it well and give it away to people in need.",1980,2022,1608,762,Nathan Womack,2022-03-13 17:48:58.865 +0100,2022-07-14 01:06:05.092 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1335,Congregation of the Oratory,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1575 a group of priests and men interested in religious life became the Congregation of the Oratory with the papal approval of Gregory XIII. In so doing they became one of many such groups of religious life founded in the Roman Catholic Church of the sixteenth century. Unlike many of these other orders, the Oratorians were not founded with a hierarchical structure enabled to organize a global order, but as a society of apostolic life. As such they were not bound to a central authority, but committed to a self-governing community. This presents a challenge for speaking about Oratorians as a group even in small chronological and geographic confines. Nevertheless, given that Oratorians drew inspiration from the original Roman Oratory inspired by Philip Neri, it is both critical and fundamental to understand Neri’s life and the Oratory he founded in sixteenth-century Rome in order to make any generalizations about the Congregation of the Oratory. Neri, born a Florentine in 1515 Neri spent most of his adult life in Rome after a conversion experience that drew him into the practice of religion. He spent many of his early years in Rome as a committed layperson until he was ordained in 1551. In those years he began a ministry that included engaging with people on the streets of Rome about religion. Rigorous asceticism, a commitment to learning about ancient Christianity, and a profound commitment to Catholic aesthetics through the visual and musical arts characterized his devotional life. Over time he developed a following from laypeople as well as ordained religious that became the Oratory, distinct from the congregation. Here, the Oratory refers to program of spiritual exercises that Neri orchestrated and led in Rome. At first spontaneity was the defining feature of these spiritual meetings, but over time these meetings became arranged in a more consistent format and included brief sermons, historical lessons, and hymns. Philip focused most of his attention on developing and sustaining these spiritual conferences rather than on the government of the group in Rome and the other Oratories it inspired. In this respect, it is fruitful to compare him with Saint Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus. While both oriented their life’s work to the revitalization of Roman Catholicism, Ignatius exerted much of his emphasis in the governance of the Society he founded through his literary correspondence and perhaps more importantly by bequeathing his order with the Constitutions, which became the foundation for the Jesuit way of life. In contrast, the first Oratorian rule was only confirmed in 1612 by Paul V, seventeen years after Philip’s death. In some ways this reflects Neri’s reluctance to found a religious group at all. He preferred to encourage men to join other religious orders. Philip expected Oratorians to spend two hours at the oratory, preach or attend four sermons a day,   preach peripatetically throughout the city, attend matins, and visit hospitals. Oratorian work was not limited to these activities. He also encouraged members of the Oratory to take part in catechizing children, and give individual spiritual direction. He was personally famous for seeing people in direction throughout the day. In addition, he commissioned some of his followers to take on specific tasks that he deemed critical. Perhaps the most significant of these assignments for the greater intellectual world of Early Modern Catholicism, if not Early Modern Europe, was the project he envisioned for Cesar Baronius: a complete history of the Church that became the Annales ecclesiastici. This multi volume work prioritized Neri’s longstanding interest in Church History, which featured in both his personal devotional life and in the works of the Oratory. These efforts earned Neri and his Oratory a reputation for holiness and virtue, so much so that when Gregory XV raised Neri to sainthood alongside Teresa of Ávila, Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier, and Isidore the Farm Laborer, an aphorism echoed through the alleys of Rome saying: “we have canonized four Spaniards and one saint.” Neri’s reputation for holiness was enhanced by his supposed thaumaturgic powers and his status as a holy mystic taken to frequent ecstatic or rapturous experiences, many of which happened while Neri meditated before a work of sacred art or heard sacred music. Neri and the Oratorians were committed to the revitalization of Catholicism in its very heart, Rome. Their approach emphasized outreach to laypeople and pilgrims and highlighted many of the features that made Catholicism distinct, both a sensuous approach through preaching, music, arts, and architecture, and an emphasis on personal piety that emphasized intellectual stimulation and asceticism.",1575,1700,991,799,Thomas SantaMaria,2022-03-14 23:43:30.467 +0100,2022-04-20 03:48:42.881 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1336,Labrang Tashi Khyi Monastery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Labrang Trashi Khyi monastery was founded in 1710 by Palshul Ngawang Tsondru (1648–1721), the first incarnation of Jamyang Shepa('Jam dbyangs zhad pa). Some modern sources mention its founding year as 1709 but it is mistaken. Its formal name is Genden Shédrup Dargyé Trashi Gyésu khyilwé Ling (dge ldan bshad sgrub dar rgyas bkra shis gyas su 'khyil ba'i gling), but it is popularly known as Labrang. Labrang has six colleges such as Thusam ling dratsang, Gyuto dratsang, Gyume dratsang, Dukhor dratsang, Sorik dratsang and Jedor dratsang. Labrang monastery is known to have more than 108 affiliated or branch or sub-branch monasteries in the Amdo region of Tibet, Mongolia and China.

The monastery lies in Sangkhok valley of the northeast Amdo region of Tibet, historically the territory of a local chief called Gangtsa Kachu(rKang tsha bk'a bcu). Presently, it is in Xiahe County in the Gannan Prefecture, Gansu Province, China, at an altitude roughly 3400 meters above sea level. 

Covering an area of 866 hectares (about 2,140 acres), the monastery accommodates 48 major temples and assembly halls and many hundreds of resident houses (grwa shag) for monks. According to their functions and classes, all houses and temples are beautifully painted red, yellow, white and sometimes orange. Most temples and assembly halls have golden roofs with classic Tibetan roof structures.  

Before 1958, there were more than 3500 resident monks who studied various Tibetan scholarships and practised monastic rituals. Still, presently there are more than 2000 resident monks. Labrang monastery welcomes thousands of visiting monks from all over Tibet and Mongolia to study and receive Buddhist teachings.",1710,2022,1762,1127,Darig Thokmay,2022-03-16 13:16:41.993 +0100,2022-11-25 11:51:45.825 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1337,Tell Afis (Syria),43,Religious Group (v6),"Tell Afis is located in north-western inner Syria. The occupation of the site dates back to Late Neolithic and expanded in the Bronze Age, when the area was also exposed to Hittite political and cultural influence. The site, however, reached its peak in the Iron Age I-II, when the city became an Aramaean capital city named Hazrek (known as Hatarikka in the Assyrian sources and as Hadrach in the Bible). The ethnic components of the site population are difficult to identify, but probably included individuals of Aramaean, Luwian, and Phoenician origin.  Several massive buildings of a probably religious character arose on its acropolis, and  it is from this context that comes the Aramaic inscription of king Zakkur (ca. 790 BCE), now in the Louvre. Zakkur was a king of Hamath and Luath, whose homeland was possibly ‘Anah, on the middle Euphrates. In his inscription the king reports how the god Baalshamayn had saved him from the siege carried out by an enemy league led by the king of Damascus, Barhadad II. Zakkur may have been a supporter of the Assyrian power who refused to join the anti-Assyrian coalition. Although mainly concerned with the favour shown to him by the god Baalshamayn (divination is also hinted to), Zakkur's inscription appears to have been placed in the temple of the god Ilwer, who therefore is likely to be considered the main god of the town. Consequently, it is to his worship that the massive temple on the top of the Iron Age acropolis was probably dedicated. Although not much is known about Ilwer’s nature, he probably was a weather-god. Perhaps it was represented by a bronze statuette found during the excavations. The function of other buildings on the acropolis is debatable, but the acropolis seems to have been now reserved for ceremonial buildings. In 738 BC the town was conquered by the Assyrians and turned into a provincial centre, thus being intensely exposed to Assyrian cultural influence: findings from the site might point to a spread of the worship of the god Sin. Dog depositions seem to anticipate a phenomenon which reached its peak on the Levantine coast in the Persian age, a period which in Tell Afis is scarcely attested.",-1200,-600,1488,1041,Giuseppe Minunno,2022-03-16 16:23:40.623 +0100,2022-05-31 18:04:34.224 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1338,The Sayings of the Desert Fathers,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Sayings of the Desert Fathers is attributed to specific monks in the Egyptian and Palestinian deserts. It is an example of ancient literature called apophthegmata, consisting of sayings by and stories about well-regarded figures of wisdom. While the original material was likely passed down orally in Coptic for some time, the oldest written version is in Greek.
There are two principal versions of this material organized in different ways. One collection is organized alphabetically according to the names of the monks cited and written about. The other collection is thematic, with sayings and stories organized according to themes such as ""Self-Control,"" ""Non-judgment,"" and ""Humility."" While the collections abound in overlapping material, the sayings and stories are not entirely identical between the two. 
While the majority of the monks represented in the text are from the Egyptian regions of Scetis and Nitria in the 4th century C.E., the collection was compiled and redacted in the early 5th century in Palestine. 
The overwhelming theme of The Sayings of the Desert Fathers is asceticism. The compiler/redactor shaped the material to focus on commonalities in ascetic practice which belie what is now known to be a vast variety of beliefs and practices in Egypt and Palestine.",390,500,1489,1128,Joshua Schachterle,2022-03-16 18:09:32.518 +0100,2022-11-08 23:46:13.583 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1339,The Temple of Millions of Years of Thutmose III,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"In ancient Egypt, during the New Kingdom (c. 1550 BC - 1077 BC), kings were usually buried in tombs in the Valley of the Kings, on the west bank of the Nile in ancient Thebes. These were protected, closed spaces. Mortuary temples, referred to by the Egyptians as Temples of Millions of Years, were built closer to the Nile, still on the west bank, where the festivals and rituals for the king were performed. The proper name for the Temple of Millions of Years of Thutmose III, is Hwt Hnkt-anx-Mn-xpr-Ra 'the temple which endows Menkhepere with life'. It was built in three main phases, probably beginning during the king's co-regency with Hatshepsut, with later additions until the time of Amenhotep II. There was also a complex belonging to a priest named Khonsu, located at the north-east corner, with bricks that date to the reign of Ramesses II, demonstrating the longevity of activity at the temple. The temple consists of an entry pylon, two courtyards with a ramp leading up to the upper terrace. The ramp is flanked by eight tree pits that have been identified as persea trees, trees that have solar associations. While the terrace area has had to be reconstructed based on limited evidence, it seems to have consisted of, from east to west, ""a portico, peristyle, hypostyle hall and chapel area"" (Seco Álvarez and Martínez Babón 2020: 193). The chapels were dedicated to the god Amun, the king Thutmose III, and, in a set to the south, to the goddess Hathor. There were also administrative buildings associated with the temple, which was then surrounded by an enclosing wall. While the temple has survived in a somewhat fragmentary state, excavations have recovered a number of fragments that reveal elements of the temple decoration. The scenes show the campaigns of the king, the sed-festival of the king, and inscriptions and figures from the ""Ritual of the Hours"". These details help to demonstrate the multifaceted nature of the temple and the festivals and rituals that would have taken place within and near its walls.",-1470,-1213,1492,707,Caroline Arbuckle,2022-03-17 00:00:21.111 +0100,2022-03-23 15:58:55.368 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1340,International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers,43,Religious Group (v6),"The International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers (ISYVC) are an organisation that operates yoga and retreat or training centres (ashrams) in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. These Centres are the trademark holder of 'Sivananda Yoga', which is, amongst practitioners, widely perceived as a distinct style of Hatha Yoga and they credit the ISYVC as the legitimate bearer of this tradition or ‘lineage’. The organisation prides itself in teaching ‘traditional yoga’ and propagates neo-Hindu teachings, referencing the guru-parampara tradition (guru lineage) of Swami Sivananda (1887-1963) and Swami Vishnu-devananda (1927-1993). The main teachings concern the practice of the “4 paths of yogas” and the “5 points of yoga”, as well as a sequence of 12 yoga asanas (postures) commonly referred to as ‘Sivananda sequence or ‘Rishikesh series. The four paths are: Bhakti Yoga (path of devotion), Karma Yoga (path of selfless action), Jnana Yoga (path of wisdom, study of Vedanta), and Raja Yoga (control of body and mind, which includes Hatha Yoga/postural yoga). The five points of yoga are: 1. Proper Exercise – Asanas 2. Proper Breathing – Pranayama 3. Proper Relaxation – Savasana 4. Proper Diet – Vegetarian 5. Positive Thinking and Meditation – Vedanta and Dhyana. 
According to ISYVC’s self-published teacher training manual (Ch. 1.14), Vishnu-devananda was sent from India to the West in the late 1950s by his guru Sivananda, to teach yoga and Vedanta. Following prolonged international travel teaching yoga, Vishnu-devananda eventually settled in Montréal, Canada, where he established the first Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre, and later, the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Camp in the Laurentian mountains, a retreat and training centre, which serves as the organisation's headquarters. 
By March 2022, the organisation is running 11 ashrams (retreat and training centres) in North America (3), the Caribbean (1), Europe (2), India (4), and Vietnam (1), as well as 27 yoga centres located in bigger cities around the world, according to ISYVC's website. Another 33 centres are registered as ‘affiliated centres’ and are run in a franchise system by adherents of the organisation and graduates of their yoga teacher training courses. 
The ISYVC runs three resident programs: the four-week Yoga Teacher Training Course (TTC) and the Advanced Yoga Teacher Training Course (ATTC), as well as a three-week practice programme called Sadhana Intensive (SI). These programs also constitute the organisation’s main source of revenue, with prices ranging from approx. 1,500 USD (TTC in India, dorm accommodation) to 5,800 USD (TTC in the Bahamas, single accommodation) (prices valid in March 2022). During the Covid-pandemic, the organisation had to close most of its centres and retreat locations around the world and started to implement online courses for yoga classes and teacher training. From April 2022 until December 2022, the ISYVC programme calendar lists 36 TTCs that are due to start, with 3-5 courses of 4 weeks length starting each month, taught in a variety of languages. 
The model of a 4-week teacher training is an established standard in the yoga industry that is based on the 200h qualification recignised by Yoga Alliance. The ISYVC claims that the 4-week TTC method was first introduced by their guru-founder Vishnu-devananda in the 1950s/60s. According to the ISYVC, the organisation has trained around 50,000 yoga teachers since the implementation of their programme (as of March 2022, according to ISYVC website). 
Although widely perceived as a provider of yoga classes and trainings, the ISYVC organisation also operates as a religious group, upholding a monastic order, in which many full-time members are initiated. ISYVC commits to the aim to propagate Hinduism and the teachings of Sivananda. The organisation does not pay teachers in yoga or training centres and operates all their activities with volunteers (karma yogis) who work without remuneration for several hours per week (as non residents), or stay as volunteers for up to several months. Full-time residents are called 'staff' by the organisation, but are also unpaid and receive lodging, food and some access to the teaching programme in exchange for free labour. Many full-time residents are encouraged to take vows of renunciation, i.e. brahmacarya (novice status that requires celibacy) or sannyas (i.e. becoming swami: monk or nun). 
In 2019, a #metoo scandal shook the ISYVC community when several former adherents publicly made allegations of sexual abuse and other types of abuse against the guru-founder Vishnu-devananda and other senior leaders in the organisation. It later was established that allegations against the guru-founder had been known to the organisation's leadership since at least 2007 (see statement of the board members, Dec 16, 2019). Consequently, a community of former and current adherents of ISYVC formed a Facebook group and organised an independent investigation into allegations of sexual abuse and other types of abuse within ISYVC. This undertaking is called ‘Project SATYA’. The Project compiled three reports that contain a counter-narrative to the hagiographical stories provided by the organisation and its devotees and documenting over several allegations of sexual abuse and other abuses by the founder and others within leadership of ISYVC. .
With only few etic and non-hagiographical accounts of the ISYVC and its history, the resources of Project SATYA are referenced throughout this entry. It should be noted that there is a lack of independent sources on the history of the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres and the biographies of its gurus. Even some academic work relies on hagiographical sources or inadvertently prioritises hagiographical accounts and reproduces admiration. Wherever this entry references resources of the ISYVC or other yoga organisations, it should be noted that they are likely hagiographical, even when not explicitly indicated. 
The organisation is not to be confused with Sivananda Ashram, Rishikesh (India) or its subsidies, which are operated by the Divine Life Society (DLS).",1957,2023,1493,1116,Jens Uwe Augspurger,2022-03-18 10:37:48.578 +0100,2023-02-20 17:34:43.274 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1341,Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada (popularly known as MSA) is a network of Muslim communities that gather at and draw their support from college campuses. The history of the MSA dates back to the early sixties, a time period when Muslim migrants from the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region, South Asia, and Far East Asia migrated in large numbers to the United States in pursuit of graduate training in STEM fields and humanities. The earliest conventions of the MSA were held on college campuses in the Midwest region, including the University of Illinois campus in Champaign-Urbana. While majority of the MSA presidents were male graduate students, their wives played an even greater role in the growth of the Muslim Students Association by establishing the Women’s Committee of the Muslim Students Association. One of the key ritual practices of the Muslim Students Association is the Quran Study Circle. It had been organized on college campuses such as Karachi University, Pakistan long before the pioneers of the Muslim Students Association migrated to the United States. Through discussing commentaries on the Quran collectively, students sought to upend the separation of religion from higher education that had been brought forth by colonization and elevate Islam as a methodological hook for an integrative model of learning. In the United States, the Quran Study Circle addressed the shared concerns of women around childrearing. Its participants were the pioneers of the Women’s Committee of the MSA. They gathered at each other’s homes and leveraged the Quran as a prompt for discussing shared experience of parenting and raising young Muslim children in suburban and ex-urban landscapes where there had been no existing institutional presence of Islam. These conversations inspired the growth of the North American Islamic School Movement. Examples include Al-Fatih Academy, a K-8th grade Islamic School that offers an integrative model of education with hopes of helping its student body learn to cognize their emotions. In addition to the development of Islamic schools, the Muslim Students Association also gave birth to the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). Located in Plainfield, Indiana, ISNA seeks to elevate Islam and uplift Muslim-American communities through interfaith dialogue and civic engagement. One of the enduring hallmarks of the Muslim Students Association has been a distinctively feminine approach to activism centered around building relationships and cultivating emotional connection across religious, national, and racial lines of difference. MSA’s commitment to a transnational ummah/community is best exemplified by the deep bonds of friendship and camaraderie between the movement’s pioneers that endure to this day.",1960,2022,1494,358,SherAfgan Tareen,2022-03-21 15:37:12.567 +0100,2022-07-05 22:55:35.334 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1342,Pauline Epistles,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Pauline epistles refer to the seven authentic Pauline letters: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Even though 13 letters in the New Testament are attributed to Paul these seven are widely regarded to have Paul as their author (in addition to the seven authentic letters, Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus are attributed to Paul). The Pauline epistles, written approx. 50–62 CE, cover an array of topics, from grand theological/philosophical questions to concrete, on-the-ground issues that arose in the Christ groups. It is important to note that even though later Christianity has based much of its theology in Paul’s letters (for example, Martin Luther’s famous “justification by faith” comes from Romans 1:17), the letters are incidental and written to specific assemblies at a specific point in time. For example, Paul only mentions the celebration of the ""Lord's supper"" in 1 Corinthians 11 because the Christ followers in Corinth celebrated the ritual in a faulty manner, according to the apostle. A further point about the Pauline epistles is that many (if not all) of them are primarily addressed to gentile Christ followers and that the topics Paul covers in his letters mainly concern gentiles in-Christ and how they should live.
	Both during his own time and after his death, Paul left a significant mark on the growing Jesus movement, and later the established church. This can be seen in a number of ways. First, the five letters that are not regarded by scholars as authentic (i.e., Paul did not write them even though they are attributed to him) show the importance in having Paul as the (claimed) author to a text in the early Jesus movement. Second, 2 Peter 3:15–16 explicitly mentions Paul and how his writings can be hard to understand. Third, as Paul’s letters make up a considerable part of the New Testament (especially if one counts all 13 letters that are attributed to him), his texts were viewed as important documents by the early Jesus movement when it started to form its canon and decided which texts were foundational for the life of the emerging church.
	The Pauline epistles have been read, studied, and influential since they were first written, and they continue to be so today. Gaining a deeper understanding of this letter collection helps us better understand the origins of what today is Christianity, Jewish Christian relations in the first century CE, and the ideas that exists in one of the most influential textual corpora in the modern West.",50,62,1495,1134,Martin Sanfridson,2022-03-21 18:46:41.381 +0100,2022-03-21 18:46:41.381 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1344,Tibetan Nonsectarianism (ris med),43,Religious Group (v6),"Tibetan nonsectarianism (ris med) describes a religious orientation in which the various philosophical and practice lineages of Tibetan Buddhism are understood as uniformly efficacious rather than as mutually exclusive competitors. Although many Tibetan Buddhists throughout history have adopted such an orientation, the concept was theorized most sophisticatedly in Kham and Amdo from the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, a period notorious for its political upheaval. Scholars have generally cited Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye Yonten Gyatso (‘Jam mgon Kong sprul Blo gros Mthaʽ yas Rgya mtsho, 1813-1899), Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (‘Jam dbyangs Mkhyen brtse’i Dbang po, 1820-1892), and Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa (O rgyan Mchog gyur Gling pa, 1829-1870), as three of the most important proponents of nonsectarianism as a self-consciously distinct, rather than implicit, orientation. All three were in close contact with one another and devoted their lives to reviving and preserving Tibetan Buddhist practices and teachings they feared were on the cusp of extinction, either due to active political suppression or popular indifference. The nonsectarian approached proved especially important in the late twentieth-century for Tibetan Buddhist teachers who had been forced into exile and sought to articulate a quasi-unified Tibetan Buddhist tradition that would be intelligible to the international world, and nonsectarianism has found a prominent place in the writings of modern luminaries as diverse as Kalu Rinpoche (Kar lu Rin po che, 1905-1989), Chogyam Trungpa (Chos rgyam Drung pa, 1939-1987), and the present Dalai Lama (Bstan ʼdzin Rgya mtsho, 1935-present).

There is not widespread agreement, either among scholars or Tibetan Buddhist teachers, about the precise use of nonsectarianism in the writings of the teachers mentioned above or in contemporary discourse. Indeed, the category is just as broad as “pluralism” or “ecumenicism.” Jamgon Kongtrul was primarily concerned with the “eight chariots of accomplishment” (sgrub brgyud shing rta chen po brgyad) while contemporary teachers are more likely to emphasize the nonsectarian orientation with respect to the Nyingma, Kagyu, Gelug, and Sakya schools. Some argue that nonsectarianism is inclusivist, and was used by teachers of Kham and Amdo to subtly assert the superiority of their own local practices, while others believe nonsectarianism should be genuinely pluralistic, wherein the Tibetan Buddhist schools are treated as coequal. Some argue that nonsectarianism implies that a Tibetan Buddhist practitioner can draw on whichever practices would be useful to them individually, while others argue that one should follow exclusively a single lineage in one’s own practice while respecting all others. These different readings have unsurprisingly yielded many different translations of ris med into English, of which “nonsectarianism” is the most common, but “ecumenicism,” “universal,” “without bias,” “impartial,” “an ecumenical approach,” “eclecticism,” “nonpartisan,” and “nondiscrimination” have also been used. A further point of ambiguity is whether Tibetan nonsectarianism was exclusively an elite discourse in the nineteenth century, or if it included popular elements as well. Although Jamgon Kongtrul, Khyentse Wangpo, and Chokgyur Lingpa were all elite monastics, they sought to popularize practices that had henceforth been aimed primarily at fellow elite practitioners.",1840,1920,1497,803,Andrew Taylor,2022-03-22 17:46:54.858 +0100,2022-04-12 15:43:06.423 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This discovery represents the oldest written text, in Old Iranian, of a prayer that is regularly recited by Zoroastrians today.
The Zoroastrian religion traces its roots to the pronouncements of an ancient Iranian named Zarathustra, which were transmitted in a language now known as ""Avestan."" As the Iranians moved across the eastern Eurasian steppes towards the plateau of Iran, several groups remained in what is now Central Asia. The Sogdians, who spoke an eastern (middle) Iranian language seem to have retained aspects of the religion that differed in expression from the Sasanian Zoroastrians. 
The identification of the Ashem Vohu prayer, which varies from the form of the prayer as preserved in the Sasanian Avesta, indicates that it was central to the religion from a very early period.",400,900,1522,1135,Jenny Rose,2022-03-23 19:47:51.527 +0100,2022-07-14 11:44:00.296 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It consists of a walled temenos (sacred precinct) and various structures (altars, at least two temples, a tholos, and two treasuries). This smaller sanctuary to Athena served as a gateway to the much larger sanctuary to Apollo, and the goddess Athena can be perceived as protecting her younger half-brother, Apollo.",-750,395,1499,942,Gino Canlas,2022-03-30 23:43:31.288 +0200,2022-03-31 18:30:15.676 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1347,"The Praise of the Bees, Exultet Hymn",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The medieval hymn Exultet was probably compiled around the 5th - 6th century by an unknown author (probably Saint Augustine, Ambrose, or Jerome). It was chanted before the paschal candle during the Easter Vigil in the Roman Rite of Mass (Easter Proclamation). It was named after the first word of the hymn Exultet iam angelica turba coelorum...and contains references to resurrection and eschatology.  of special and particular interest is the part of the hymn known as the Praise of the Bees, which forms an exclamation of the insect as creator of the holy wax, the honey, and as a symbol of Virgin Mary due to its reputed -then- physical chastity. There were two textual versions of the hymn, the earliest Beneventan and the later Franco-roman version.

1348,Disability-focused Christianity for Palestinians,43,Religious Group (v6),"This group includes the many Christian-based NGOs and parachurch ministries in Bethlehem that are providing services for people with disabilities. Most institutes employ Muslims as well as Christians but are Christian in name and practice. Most of the Christians, then, belong to recognized churches in addition to this group.

I conducted 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork with two NGOs in Bethlehem providing services for people with (primarily intellectual) disabilities (May 2021- May 2022). Most of the data in this article is based on my primary methods of participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Over this time I visited 12 different organizations and interviewed their staff. While each NGO is organizationally separate, they are unified by friendships of varying closeness (and some familiar ties), a shared purpose in improving the lives of people with disabilities in the region, and in some cases, the same people receiving services (some simultaneously and others at different times). Some of the staff have rotated between the organizations as well. 

Another feature that unifies this group is the relatively marginal support they receive from local churches. Most individuals are connected with the major denominations, regularly attending a Catholic, Orthodox, or Lutheran church, but a lot of support (emotional, financial, staffing) comes from international churches or non-church Palestinian institutions, like local universities. Collegiate special education programs provide regular and reliable volunteers for several of these organizations as students complete their practical training.

Something that distinguishes this group from other members of the same denominations is their understanding and practice of inter-faith dialogue. Along with other interfaith initiatives in the West Bank and Bethlehem in particular, these disability-related organizations demonstrate a high-level of collaboration, as will be detailed more in the qualitative notes of this entry.

While small numerically, this group is important to consider because of the disproportional impact it has on its community. See the primary source, “Mapping of Christian Organizations in Palestine: Social and Economic Impact” (George Akroush). As Bethlehem has developed and urbanized, it has become a hub of services for Palestinians, medical and otherwise. There are significantly fewer resources available for people living in the villages surrounding Bethlehem, and some will even come from the villages of Hebron and Ramallah to receive services. While growing, the organizations as a whole still struggle to provide all of the services needed.",2012,2022,1502,802,Kevin Vollrath,2022-04-03 17:35:14.814 +0200,2022-11-23 11:22:59.468 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1349,The Dingxiang Wang Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"Dingxiang Wang is a multifaceted deity from the area of Changsha, Hunan, China, who became an important object of Hunanese worship both within and beyond the province in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The earliest mention of this deity dates back to the Song, during which he was described as the city god (chenghuang) of Tanzhou. He first appeared with frequency in the Qing as a local deity, and then the city god (chenghuang) of Shanhua County, Hunan, which was centered in Changsha. Legends describe him variously as the spirit of an upright demon-quelling official, a flood-calming official, or a locust-eating official, all of whom sacrificed themselves for Changsha. In 1847, he is said to have emerged from the Xiang River and possessed the body of a water-seller, and then marched to the magistrate’s yamen and reported for duty as the city god. He thus took on the aspect of a scholar-official, and several accounts indicate that he advised many hopeful participants in the provincial examinations. In 1852, during the Taiping siege of Changsha, Dingxiang Wang was one of at least two deities (including Li Zhenren) whose images were brought to the top of the city walls in an attempt to repel the enemy. Dingxiang Wang was reported to have been effective: When he was turned towards the battlefield, enemy cannon-fire was repelled, and the Taiping soldiers scaling the walls were pushed into midair. His legends state that he manifested as a spectral general who paced the walls and could be seen in a pavilion atop the wall, planning and directing the battle. For this service, Dingxiang Wang received the official moniker “yongzhen.” Dingxiang Wang thus became closely associated with the Xiang Army (Hunan Army), a military force that emerged from Changsha-area social networks. Its leaders, including Zeng Guofang and Zuo Zongtang, then received visions and guidance from Dingxiang Wang during their campaigns across the Qing. Dingxiang Wang was known to Xiang Army soldiers not only as a healer, but as a protector, as they fought the Taiping, Nian, and northwestern Muslim rebels all the way to Kashgar in Xinjiang. His worshippers, including the army's leaders but particularly demobilized soldiers, left temples to him across China, where he began to take on other meanings. Dingxiang Wang manifested again in the Sino-French War (1884–1885), in which he protected the coast from foreign cannons, following which he received another title, ""fushun."" The two known images of him reflect the same combination of aspects: he appears as an upright Confucian scholar-official, but with a tiger skin over his shoulders, indicating military prowess. In Xinjiang, meanwhile, a distinct tradition emerged by the early 1890s—not long after the arrival of Hunanese settlers in 1877—in which the Dingxiang Wang legend was adapted to reflect soldiers' experiences in the borderland, while the deity himself was referred to as ""Fangshen."" The deity was now said to have been an exiled soldier who, earlier in the Qing, had bravely protected his fellows by diving into a flooded fortress, saving them but sacrificing himself. By the 1910s, he was considered the special city god of Han settlers in Xinjiang. At the same time, he appeared as the protector of Changsha and of Nanjing in the Warlord Era, while newspaper reports indicated that in the 1920s he manifested several times in Changsha in order to punish the wicked. Worship continued in the homeland only until the late 1930s, at which point he fell into obscurity. This was the occasion for the compilation of an important temple gazetteer in Nanjing, where one of his “temporary residences” (xinggong) was very active as a center of Hunanese life. He was still known in Xinjiang into the 1990s. The Dingxiang Wang cult thus defined a complex diasporic community.",1124,1991,1503,1140,Eric Schluessel,2022-04-04 03:48:16.969 +0200,2022-04-04 19:33:53.755 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1350,Mt. Emei 峨眉山,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Mt. Emei is well-known as one of the four Buddhist sacred mountains in China, devoted to the worship of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva (Ch: Puxian pusa 普賢菩薩), the bodhisattva associated with ""practice"", and represented, iconographically, on a white elephant with six tusks. Mt. Emei is made of four main peaks, called Big Emei (Ch: Da e 大峨), Second Emei (Ch: Er e 二峨), Third Emei (Ch: San e 三峨), and Fourth Emei (Ch: Si e 四峨), which all house Buddhist temples. However, in the early days of the Imperial era, Mt. Emei was considered mostly a Daoist sacred site and had housed several Daoist temples since the Eastern Han (25-220 CE); this is why Mt. Emei is also known, in the Daoist context, as “the seventh grotto” (Ch: diqi dongtian 第七洞天). Buddhists have been present on Mt. Emei since the Eastern Jin period (317-420 CE), with the monk Huichi 慧持 moving there from Lushan and building Puxian Temple (Ch: Puxiansi 普賢寺), which is now called Wannian Temple (Ch: Wanniansi 萬年寺). The temple was so named because of the Samantabhadra statue enshrined there, and this may be the origin of the cult of Samantabhadra on the mountain; certainly, by the Northern and Southern Song, Mt. Emei was enshrined as a Samantabhadra site. During the Eastern Jin, Daoists and Buddhists coexisted, although a series of Daoist temples started being converted into Buddhist sites. Buddhism developed and spread even further during the Tang and Song, also due to the Imperial support during the Tang. During the Ming, the amount of Daoists and Daoist sites starts declining, and by the Qing they were outnumbered by the Buddhist presence; it was during the Qing that Mt. Emei became mainly a Buddhist site, and many of the temples that we see today were, indeed, rebuilt during that period. The monastic population of Mt. Emei has changed continuously, with new Sangha members moving to the mountain and other traveling to other sites for study and practice; this factor, plus the lack of a clear system of management of the temples, makes the reconstruction of the history of the local Sangha and individual temples very difficult. Mt. Emei housed only male temples until the 1950s; it was in the 1950s that the local committee of the Buddhist Association of China discussed the relocation of nuns from nunneries in the neighboring counties to Mt. Emei. In 1956, Fuhu Temple (Ch: Fuhusi 伏虎寺) became a nunnery with 21 resident nuns, and the nun Qingchang 清常 acting as abbess. Right now there are five main nunneries on Mt. Emei: Fuhu Temple, that also hosts the female branch of the Mt. Emei Institute of Buddhist Studies; Leiyin Temple (Ch: Leiyinsi 雷音寺), Chunyang Hall (Ch: Chunyang dian 純陽殿), Shengshui Temple (Ch: Shengshuige 聖水閣), Shanjue Nunnery (Ch: Shanjuesi善覺寺). The Daoist nature of the site is still felt on the mountain, not only for the presence of important Daoist masters in the area even after the early Imperial time, but also with the belief that Lu Chunyang 呂純陽 became an immortal there.",100,2022,1504,904,Stefania Travagnin,2022-04-04 19:34:14.773 +0200,2023-01-08 11:56:45.780 +0100,Mapping Religious Diversity in Modern Sichuan
1352,Śākadvīpīya Brāhmaṇas,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Śākadvīpīya (or Maga) Brāhmaṇas are a little known Brahmanical group mainly settled in Rājasthān and Bihār. According to the ancient texts, they are Hindu Sun worshippers but also include Buddhist, Jaina and Iranian features in their cult. In the Sāmba- and Bhaviṣya-purāṇa, the story of their legendary migration is told: Sāmba, Kr̥ṣṇa’s son, is hit by leprosy, and only the Sun god can heal him. For this reason, the Śākadvīpīya Brāhmaṇas, experts in Sun cult, are called from Iran to Northern India to worship the god and heal Sāmba’s sickness. Very interestingly, many Iranian elements are present both in the content and in the language of these Purāṇic passages, such as Iranian loanwords, ritual objects and customs.  
Over the centuries, the Śākadvīpīya presence is registered in India in epigraphic sources, in the peculiar Sun god iconography with Iranian traits, by the astrologer and astronomer Varāhamihira (6th century CE), travellers’, and three late poems, namely the Magavyakti, the Sāmvavijaya and the Khalavaktracapeṭika  (probably ca. 16th century), which record the family names and further legends on the Śākadvīpīyas. They must have been very famous in northern courts in some periods, especially in relation to Sun worship, and even the fact that their texts have been inserted in the Purāṇic literature testifies to their social importance; the same is valid for the later poems. 
Their cult is perfectly inserted in the syncretistic tendency that has characterized North Indian cults since the first centuries CE, when some groups living in the lands in between Iran and India moved to North India and established powerful reigns there. The Śākadvīpīyas may have followed the same route, settled in India, built their sacred places, and specialised in Sun cult. 
Nowadays, Śākadvīpīya communities are still present on Indian soil, in the same ancient areas of settlement. Śākadvīpīya priests are still versed in astrology and the main solar festivals are still celebrated by the community. Unfortunately, the new generations are generally not interested in their peculiar customs, and most of them are aware of belonging to a specific tradition only because of marriage endogamic policies. However, in the last years, small groups of Śākadvīpīya people have started again cultivating the interest in their traditions and rediscovered their ancient customs. To revitalise the community, new associations have been created and some magazines, like the Rājasthāni Brahmāṇḍ Cetnā, have been published on monthly basis.",2,21,1505,1119,Martina Palladino,2022-04-06 13:29:57.239 +0200,2022-04-20 09:03:58.505 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It was written by Palladius the bishop of Helenopolis (also known as Palladius of Galatia) around 420 C.E. It takes its modern name from the fact that it was written under the patronage of Lausus, a high-ranking administrator in the imperial court, to whom it is addressed. Palladius wrote that the stories and sayings he had collected would be edifying for all people, not only monastics, and that all readers could adapt the practices and general spiritual orientation of the monks to their own circumstances. 
The first 39 chapters are stories and sayings of monks and nuns, while chapters 40-70 concern the lives of venerable ascetics, men and women, from the wealthier classes.",419,420,1510,1128,Joshua Schachterle,2022-04-07 17:40:31.194 +0200,2022-04-29 20:21:54.990 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1357,Encratites,43,Religious Group (v6),"It’s a popular early Christian movement characterized by the defense of chastity, rejection of marriage and perhaps a refusal of meat and wine. However, it’s a poorly defined movement as there aren’t clear boundaries of where and when it took place and who were its adherents. 
The name comes from the Greek word egkrateia, which means restraint from one’s emotions and desires and self-control. This was considered a virtue in the Greco-Roman world, and examples of communities that abstained from sex and had strict diets are abundant already in pre-Christian communities. In Christian context, Encratism appears in second-century charges of heresists against Marcion, Saturninus and Tatian. But in addition to naming a heresy and identifying a specific group, encratism it is also understood as a general tendency of eschatological early Christian communities to refuse sex and sexuality. 
In the first scenario, we have the writings of Church Fathers, namely Irenaeus (185) and Clement of Alexandria (190), accusing Marcion and Saturninus of presenting marriage as corruption and Tatian of advancing these ideas. Irenaeus and Hippolytus (ca.225) also mention they abstain from eating living things (probably meat). Jerome (385) is the first Church Father to also add refusal of wine as an Encratite rule.
According to these Fathers, Encratic rules were based on theological formulations about salvation. Tatian would've posited that Adam and Eve created separation from the Holy Spirit through the original sin putting humans and animals on the same level. As a consequence, humans acquired animalistic characteristics such as mortality and sex drive. The vegetarian diet and chastity were intended to lessen these characteristics and bring humans close to their original purity and proximity with the Holy Spirit.
In the second scenario, it seems that from the second century throughout Late Antiquity, Christians from several sects adopted at least some form of continence or dietary restrictions. Whether Encratism was an actual movement or just a widespread practice is uncertain. Its interwoven with other movements is clear in the Edict of 382, for example. In the document, the Emperor Theodosius pronounces a death sentence to all that take the name of Encratites and affirms they are Manichaeans (another persecuted sect) in disguise.
In scholarship, encratism has been used interchangeably with early Christian asceticism. It has also been linked to the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of the Egyptians, the Apocryphal Acts, particularly in relation to chaste women, and passages of the New Testament (Luke 2:36; Matt 1:24; I Tim 4:1-4).",100,400,1517,1136,Naiara Leão,2022-04-07 20:35:50.838 +0200,2022-04-13 01:23:56.188 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1358,"Deir el-Bala’izah, Monastery of Abba Apollo",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastery of Abba Apollo in Deir el-Bala’izah is situated on the left bank of the Nile, circa 18km to the south of Asiut, in Egypt. The first to investigate the site was F. Petrie (1907; 1909) who carried out brief excavation research, mainly in quest for papyri. Much later, P. Grossman conducted fieldwork and provided a more detailed description of the settlement (see: Grossmann 1993).
It is considered that the first monastic habitations were adjusted in a pre-existing (presumably Roman?) quarry that was cut into the cliff that carries the desert plateau. Then the settlement extended down the rather steep slope and it was protected by an enclosure wall. The base of the wall is thicker as it was made of large stones connected
with mud; the wall itself is constructed of mud-brick. It had a main gate on the east and several side entrances on the sides. The ruins in front of the main gate are interpreted as a guest-house. 
The entire settlement occupies an almost trapezoid area, where the remains of buildings still stand - some of them at a considerable height. The buildings were constructed of mud-brick and there is evidence that many of them had multiple storeys. They are gathered especially on the upper slope and inside a row of the quarry caves. 
Two large three-aisled structures are interpreted as refectories. The elongated buildings around them were identified by Grossmann (1993, 190-194) as dormitories. However, Wipszycka (2009, 119-120) argued that they could have been either store rooms either buildings of industrial function. Another building, which is characterised by a number of niches, was considered to be the library of the monastery, yet such an interpretation should be dealt with caution. 
Remains of two churches were discovered: a small church was built at the south-eastern corner of the site and another one to the west, around and outside a quarry cave.
The water was supplied by a rectangular well.",650,800,1512,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2022-04-08 14:36:26.538 +0200,2022-04-20 14:22:32.821 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1359,Shrine at En Hazeva,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The ritual space at ‘En Hazeva is iconic, yet poorly understood. The site was excavated in the 1980’s by the Israel Antiquities Authority, yet the final results of the excavations have not yet been fully published, and only preliminary reports are available (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a; 1995b; 1996; Ben-Arieh 2011). The site consists of a multi-strata fort with a ritual space identified outside the walls on the northeastern side of the site, and not far from the main entrance. The extramural religious context has been dated to Stratum 4 (seventh through early sixth centuries BCE), though it may have been in use earlier as is suggested by its relation to Stratum 5 architecture (ninth-eighth century BCE), and the remaining ambiguity in understanding the site. Outside the fortification walls a rectilinear “U” shaped structure was identified and interpreted as a shrine. However, the most significant religious remains were excavated at the base of the fortress walls, near the shrine, but where they appear to have been ritually interred within a favissa, presumably at the time that the shrine had gone out of use. Within the favissa, 67 clay objects and vessels were found in addition to seven stone altars. The ceramic vessels include anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic stands, pedestalled bowl incense burners, chalices, perforated tripod cup incense burners, incense shovels, bowls, and pomegranates. The anthropomorphic figures present appear to represent priests or worshippers. A stone sculpture that may be representative of a deity was also excavated. On the basis of extant data, it is not possible to definitively identify the deity or deities that were the focal point of activity at the shrine. However, the discovery of an incised goring bull is suggestive of a weather deity, and on the basis of material culture similarities to Edom and the shrine at Horvat Qitmit, it is possible to suggest that Qos (qws) was the featured deity. It would not be surprising if the deity were worshipped together with a divine female consort, though no explicit evidence for such was identified. The location of the shrine as outside the walls of the fortress and adjacent a major trade route linking North Arabia to the Mediterranean suggests its function may have been associated with aspects of mobility and persons moving through the region.",-700,-550,1513,842,Andrew Danielson,2022-04-11 18:51:09.427 +0200,2023-02-08 18:40:16.617 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It hosted the Pythian Games every four years from the Archaic period until the end of Antiquity and constantly drew large numbers of pilgrims to it. The sanctuary's importance is reflected in the exponential growth of material investment in the sanctuary throughout its existence (temples, treasuries, other monuments, votive offerings, etc.). The sanctuary's importance also made it the focus of numerous conflicts among the Greek states. The sanctuary was administered by a league of Greek states called the Amphiktyony, whose member-states occasionally competed with each other for control of the sanctuary and its territory.",-900,395,1515,942,Gino Canlas,2022-04-12 01:19:33.200 +0200,2022-04-12 01:19:33.200 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1367,Targums,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The meaning of the Aramaic word תרגום 'targum' (pl.תרגומים 'targumim') is 'translation' or 'interpretation'. It derives from the Akkadian word targummanu(m) 'interpreter, translator', which first occured in the beginning of the second millenium BCE. The Aramaic word was later adopted in Hebrew and Arabic.
The term generally refers to written translations in any language. In the context of biblical (and Jewish) studies, it primarily refers to renderings of biblical texts in Aramaic; i.e. Targums. The Targums are interpretative reproductions of the original (Hebrew) biblical text for the Aramaic-speaking Jewish audience. They consist of both translational renderings of the Hebrew text and additional material (additions, omissions, interpretative interpolations) which provide insights into ancient Jewish interpretation of biblical narratives. 
There are Targums to all books of the Bible except for Ezra and Daniel, the biblical books which include Aramaic portions. Targum Onqelos is a targum of the Pentateuch, and Targum Jonathan is a targum to the Prophets; In addition, there is also Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Targum Neofiti and the so-called Fragment Targum. However, different books of the Writings were composed individually.
From the Qumran we have evidence that some written Targums (eg. the Qumran Job Targum) existed in early times and that they were known to Rabbi Gamaliel I and Gamaliel II. More recent Targumic manuscripts come from the sixteenth century. However, the main period in which the Targumic tradition was - so to say - at its 'peak' is the period between the 1st and the 7th century (mainly the period of rabbinic Judaism).",70,601,1521,770,Srecko Koralija,2022-04-14 17:38:28.034 +0200,2022-04-20 16:09:56.680 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1368,"Quarrying Cult at Simitthus (Chemtou, Tunisia)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The entry focuses on the religious activities of a group of imperial freedman procurators in their management of the marble quarries at Simitthus, a city in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis, in active operation as imperial property beginning in the second half of the second century CE to the mid third century. The marble quarry, which formed the economic backbone of the city of Simitthus, is also a site where the boundaries of public and private religion blur as the procurators and their staff utilized local deities to control risks associated with extractive operations through targeted on-site deployment of deities connected to or made to connect to extraction operations. This entry strictly examines a period from 64 CE - 211 CE when the religious activities of these extraction officials are epigraphically attested (largely our only way to understand the religious dynamics at this site. The use of deities connected with industrial operations, in particular in imperial mining districts, has several analogues from other contemporary extractive operations, such as in the provinces of Dalmatia and Aquitania. The on the job utilization of certain types of local and agricultural deities, like Tellus and Terra Mater, and deities connected with mountains, is seen across several mining districts and seems to represent a reflex of Roman religious practices connected with the aversion of risk, especially agricultural risk, from economic operations. In engaging in these behaviours and moving around different mining districts, it is likely that a sort of orthopraxy for dealing with unseen risks accreted around certain deities like Terra Mater and Tellus, and created avenues for estimating what sorts of deities would be most efficient to seek out in unfamiliar areas (mountains). The religious feelings of the slave workforce, housed in a barracks-like structure to the northwest of the town, are little known. The marble quarrying zone, roughly 0.4 km in extent, occupies a zone comprising three hills at the heart of the city more or less. The quarrying zone is demarcated by a low wall that separates the town from the quarry. The quarry is bounded on one side by the river Bagradas, which allowed for the transport of the special yellow marble produced in the area, known to scholars as giallo antico.",-150,299,1523,1155,David Wallace-Hare,2022-04-15 10:59:57.077 +0200,2022-05-18 07:30:12.636 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1369,Astronomers in Babylon,43,Religious Group (v6),"Scribes residing in Babylon and associated with the Esagila, the temple of Marduk in Babylon, and producing numerous kinds of astronomical texts, most prominently the Astronomical Diaries and the mathematical astronomical texts (referred to as ACT in modern scholarship). Their collective identity and their capacity, particularly early on, is not entirely clear.
Initially, these scribes were most likely part of the prebendary system, an inherited, part-time privilege in which certain families and individuals had duties to serve the gods on certain days of the month or the year, including but not exclusively celestial observation. In return, they were given a share of the temple offerings.
Following the failed rebellion against Persian rule in the 5th century, the prebendary system was abolished. After a period of recuperation, the Esagila was re-organized and governed by guild-like professional associations, one of which bore the title of “scribes of Enūma Anu Enlil” (the celestial omens series), the closest equivalent to the term “astronomer” in the cuneiform record.

1370,Teda,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Teda are a society of nomadic pastoralists part of a larger ethnic group known as “Tebu.” They reside primarily in high plateaus of the Tibesti Mountains in what is now the Republic of Chad (Simpson 2011:1). This entry focuses on the Teda of Tibesti around the time of 1925. At this time, this region was part of French Equatorial Africa and therefore under the political control of France. Although the Teda live in a highly remote area, Tibesti is located along important caravan routes that have historically given the Teda both control over trade and a high level of contact with other societies and religious groups. The majority of Teda are Muslim, having likely been converted early in the spread of Islam across Africa (Simpson 2011:7). Prayer is very important, as are certain holidays, such as Ramadan, and pilgrimages. Among the Teda, Islamic practices appear to have been largely syncretic with the traditional Teda religion practiced before conversion to Islam. However, during the time focus of this entry, influences from an Islamic missionary group resulted in more fundamental practices of Islam among the Teda. For the Teda, religious beliefs are inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1935,1960,1525,1090,Anj Droe,2022-04-15 21:44:54.145 +0200,2022-06-13 15:06:30.824 +0200,eHRAF
1371,Twelver Shi'ism in post-revolutionary Iran,43,Religious Group (v6),"Twelver Shi’ism, also known as Ithna ‘Ashari, Twelvers or Imami Shi’a, is the main branch of Shi’a Islam and maintains the largest population of Shi’a Muslims worldwide. It has a population of around 200 million and constitutes the majority in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, and Azerbaijan. What characterizes Twelver Shi’ism in terms of their fundamental beliefs is their view on the successorship of Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. For them, Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law and cousin, and eleven of Ali’s direct descendants, known as Imams, are the sole religious and political authorities after the Prophet. This belief further defines the way in which the religiopolitical identity of Twelver Shi’ism has been developed through the course of history.

Iran has the largest Twelver Shi’a population, estimated at approximately 76-80 million, i.e. 90-95% of today’s Iranian population. Twelver Shi’ism is the state religion of Iran since the 16th century, and its legal and theological doctrines are integrated into the country’s legal code and constitution. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, Iran’s constitution was significantly revised to better reflect the Twelvers’ ideology and legal thought. Specifically, the theory of Vilayat-e Mutlaqe-ie Faqih [the guardian jurist’s absolute authority] was incorporated into the Iranian legal system. According to this theory, strongly advocated by Ayatollah Khumayni, the founder and former leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the state’s major decisions must be supervised and confirmed by a Twelver Shi’a Mujtahid, a  scholar of the highest-ranking in Shi’a legal thought. Therefore, by the constitution, the head of the Iranian state today, i.e. its supreme leader, has to be a Twelver Shi’a Mujtahid, elected by the Council of Experts, a deliberative assembly of more than eighty other Twelver Shi’a Mujtahids.This suffices to show how religion and state are interconnected in Iran. Also, Twelver Shi’a ideology is deeply intertwined with various areas of Iranian culture, economy, education, etc. and its footprints can be observed all over the post-revolutionary Iranian public life. It also plays a significant role in defining Iran’s international diplomacy. For example, the Iran-Israel ongoing conflict is deeply rooted in the Twelvers’ religious ideology and the role of Iranian religious leadership in defining the state’s international relations. 

In sum, contemporary Iranian cultural, political, and social values are heavily influenced by Twelver Shi’ism ideology, legal thought, and worldview. For the purpose of this entry, our focus centers around documenting ideological, cultural, social, and political tenets that characterize Twelver Shi’ism in post-revolutionary Iran (1979-current).",1979,2022,1526,1117,Hasan Doagoo,2022-04-15 22:51:28.600 +0200,2022-04-27 22:25:13.959 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1374,The Reformed Church (Early Orthodoxy),43,Religious Group (v6),"The period often identified as Reformed orthodoxy (alternatively, Reformed scholasticism) within the history of the Reformed church lasts from approximately 1560 until 1800. It is traditionally subdivided into three shorter periods: early orthodoxy (1560–1620), high orthodoxy (1620–1700), and late orthodoxy (1700–1800). Most historians fix the beginning of early orthodoxy to the transition from the second to the third generation of reformers, as Peter Martyr Vermigli (d. 1562), Wolfgang Musculus (d. 1563), John Calvin (d. 1564), and their second-generation peers were replaced by Theodore Beza, Zacharius Ursinus, Girolamo Zanchi, and others. It was a period of solidification for the Reformed tradition, witnessing the spread of confessional statements of faith—including the Gallic Confession (1559), Belgic Confession (1561), Second Helvetic Confession (1562), Heidelberg Catechism (1563), and eventually the Canons of Dort (1619)—which delineated the boundaries of the Reformed faith and reinforced its differences with other forms of Protestantism. The theology of the period is marked by a return to the scholastic method of the late medieval period and the rise of intra-Reformed disputes about particular theological doctrines (e.g., predestination), a trend which intensified throughout the first half of the seventeenth century as disputes turned increasingly to the minutiae of Reformed theology. The end of early orthodoxy has been located as early as 1620 (with the Canons of Dort serving as the approximate conclusion of the period in Willem van Asselt’s periodization) to as late as the 1640s (with the end of the Thirty Years’ War and the Westminster Assembly marking the transition in Richard Muller’s periodization).",1560,1620,1527,1122,Wesley Viner,2022-04-17 15:18:28.828 +0200,2022-04-17 15:18:28.828 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1375,Epic of Gilgamesh,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Epic of Gilgamesh is a Babylonian narrative poem that recounts the adventures of the eponymous King Gilgamesh, the legendary ruler of the city state of Uruk. Stories about Gilgamesh were told from at least the 21st century BCE to the second century CE in a variety of formats, including a Sumerian cycle of poems, an epic poem in Akkadian, prose versions in Hittite and Hurrian, and visual depictions, not to mention oral retellings that have not survived in the archeological record.

The Babylonian epic developed continuously from the early second to the early first millennium BCE. Scholars recognize three main phases: an Old Babylonian epic that is imperfectly preserved; a Middle Babylonian phase of revision and experimentation; and an edited version in the Standard Babylonian language, composed around the 11th century BCE. The latter version, consisting of twelve Tablets (the twelfth of which forms an appendix to the main narrative of the first eleven), is the best-preserved and best-known account of Gilgamesh's story.

The epic can be divided into two parts, the first of which tells of Gilgamesh's love and triumphs, the second of his loss and failures. Gilgamesh is a restless, tyrannic king in Uruk, and the gods send the wild man Enkidu to befriend and distract him. The two become close friends, possibly lovers, and set off on a series of heroic adventures, killing the monster Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. But halfway through the epic, Enkidu dies, and the second half of the story relates Gilgamesh's profound grief and his ultimately futile attempt to achieve immortality.",-1900,-130,1531,1129,Sophus Helle,2022-04-18 03:31:47.878 +0200,2022-04-18 19:13:58.614 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1376,African Initiated Churches,43,Religious Group (v6),"African Initiated Churches, otherwise also known as African Independent Churches and Pentecostal-Charismatic Churches (see Birgit Meyer) denotes a group of religious individuals brought together by the need to appropriate Christianity with traditional African belief systems. The term 'African Initiated Churches' thus categorises clusters of religious groupings formally termed the Zionist, Ethiopian and Messianic Churches. 

Since Christianity is expanding rapidly in Africa, recent theorists suggest that the threefold categorisation fails to capture the complexity and vibrancy of said religious groups; distinguishing rather between followers of the 'Book' and the 'Word' (see M Nel). For this entry, we focus primarily on the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) in South Africa. 

The group derives its name and theological bent from a variety of sources. Historically, the Scottish-Australian minister John Alexander Dowie who went to America and started the city of Zion movement which emphasised healing had a great influence on the formation of the Zionist churches in Africa. For example, Dowie exerted significant influence over the local South African Dutch Reformed missionary, Pieter L Le Roux, who became increasingly interested in the matter of healing after reading Dowie's works and coming across localised testimonies of healing. After resigning from the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC), Le Roux started a church for all members in South Africa which included Zulu speaking individuals. As M Nel writes, 'Le Roux's Zionist group was characterised by their accommodation to indigenous habits and beliefs. The worship was lively and loud and the clothing colourful' (See Nel, p. 206). Le Roux is thus credited with starting the Zionist movement in South Africa. 

A Biblical thematic central to both Dowie and Le Roux was the concept of the cultic centre (see Kelebogile Resane). In Hebrew Scriptures the Mount of Zion represented a centralised place of congregation and worship of God. In many respects it also represented the promises of Yahweh to the Jewish nation. Since Mount Zion also served as a place of ritual and worship, life itself was centred around the holy place. Zion City in Moria, Limpopo, has come to denote a similarly theologically significant place for the believers within the ZCC. Twice yearly all members are encouraged to participate in worship during the Easter festival and in September.
 
The ZCC and its African initiated affiliates were long overlooked in religious and theological inquiry because the emphasis on faith healing and the appreciation of African traditional practices was regarded as functioning outside of the theological. As a result religious phenomenon was relegated to the sociological and anthropological. Recent theological inquiry shows, however, a great wealth of knowledge that is just beginning to be uncovered by modern day scholars. 

Due to the fact that the ZCC and its annual meetings, in particular, are kept private and rarely opened to media, the information at researchers' disposal is scant.",1900,2022,1529,1153,Rozelle Bosch,2022-04-18 13:02:12.417 +0200,2022-04-30 05:24:17.400 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1377,Sídhe,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The sídhe (pronounced ""shee"") are the hollow hills said to have been the homes of the ancient Irish gods, in other words, they are the Irish Otherworld.  To most readers the term will be familiar from its appearance in banshee (ban-sídhe), referring to a woman of the sídhe.  We cannot really determine when the concept of the sídhe first arose.  However, the first surviving references appear in early Irish manuscript literature, dating to two or three centuries after Saint Patrick.  Medieval and later manuscripts mention over 170 sídhe, and in local folk tradition there are many more.  Often they are said to be artificial mounds, but the majority are isolated natural hills, sometimes with a manmade mound on the top.  However, the term can also refer to lakes, rivers, springs, or islands.  Those who live in the sídhe are referred to as the áes sídhe (modern Irish aos sí) or perhaps more often as ""the good people.""  In earlier times they were known as the Tuatha Dé, or ""tribe of the gods.""  According to the ancient Irish annals, the Tuatha Dé came to Ireland in ships, sailing through the sky, in 1897 BCE, a time that would be toward the end of the early Bronze Age.  In translating the Irish tales into English, sídhe are often referred to as elf-mounds and their inhabitants as fairies.  Both of these translations seriously distort the Irish understanding of the terms.  A síd is associated with each of the major Iron Age ritual complexes referred to as ""royal sites,"" located in the five ancient provinces, at Tara in Meath, Rathcroghan in Connacht, Emain Macha in Ulster, Dún Ailinne in Leinster, and Cashel in Munster.  However, best known of the sídhe is Síd in Broga or Brugh na Bóinne (""mansion of the Boyne""), today known as the passage tumulus of Newgrange.  Although at various times Newgrange is said to have been the home of the Dagda (the ""good god""), of Elcmar, or of the Dagda's son Oengus, one important question, probably unanswerable, is whether the stories of the áes sídhe were created by people of a much later time to explain these monuments or the monuments were seen from the beginning as dwelling places of the gods, i.e., were they temples rather than primarily tombs, as they are usually interpreted by modern archaeologists.  Since we are dealing with a class of places, many of the answers to the questions that follow should be modified by ""sometimes"" or ""often.""",600,1800,1532,742,Ronald Hicks,2022-04-18 20:30:16.203 +0200,2022-04-23 21:19:03.393 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1378,Monastery of Apa Apollo in Bawit,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The monastic settlement of Apa Apollo in Bawit is situated in middle-Egypt, between the modern cities of al-Minya and Assiut. It lies on the edge of the Nile Valley, on a naturally formed hill (kom). It is a typical ‘monastic village’, with hermitages built close to each other. According to the Historia Monachorum in Aegypto, it was founded by Abba Apollo around 386-388 AD, but no archaeological evidence of such an early date is traced so far. According to inscriptions, the monastery existed until the tenth century, while the site was abandoned in the late eleventh or beginning of the twelfth century.   
  Walter Ewing Crum and Jean Clédat were the first to identify the site as the monastery of Apa Apollo in the early 20th century. Archaeological investigations were first carried out by a French expedition (IFAO) between 1901/1902 and 1913. The site was then researched again in 1976-1985 by the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation. Fieldwork was resumed in 2003 (by IFAO and the Louvre) and continues until nowadays.   
  The excavations have brought to light three churches.  
  The ‘southern’ church was probably built in the seventh century AD. It was excavated in the early twentieth century and after the end of the investigations, it was destroyed by the removal of the architectural sculpture and a selection of wall paintings. The removed finds are nowadays kept in the Coptic Museum in Cairo and in the Louvre Museum.    
  The church of Archangel Michael (also known as ‘northern’ church) is a three-aisled building with a sanctuary at the east, measuring 20.10 x 12.20 m. The walls are made of fired-brick and mud-brick and the floor is of limestone slabs. A wooden screen divides the sanctuary into two parts. The presence of a khurus in the western part is an indication that the church was built after the middle of the seventh century or the beginning of the eighth century. Wall-paintings decorated the walls, the columns and the pillars at the interior of the church.      
  The main church of the complex is a three-aisled basilica with a tripartite sanctuary at the east, measuring 21.2 x 39.6 m (max. dim). Its walls are made of fired bricks with an external facing of limestone blocks. The building underwent various modifications (e.g. reconstruction of south wall with reused blocks, addition of a khurus in the seventh century). The main church was constructed in the late 6th-early seventh century AD. The interior of the entire building was decorated with wall-paintings. Furthermore, the carved architectural decoration in wood and stone would have been quite elaborate, as indicated by the large number of sculpted architectural remains, which are unearthed.  
  In addition to the churches, many buildings were discovered. Some of them were rather impressive, with several barrel-vaulted storeys, and walls decorated with wall-paintings, inscriptions, dipinti, and so on. They were initially identified as chapels, but it is now known that they must have been monastic dwellings.   
  Among them, the so-called 'Building 1' is fully excavated. It consists of several rooms surrounding a courtyard. Access to the building was given from the south-western room. The walls of a vaulted room, east of the courtyard was richly decorated with wall-paintings.   
  The geophysical survey carried out by T. Herbich showed that the site was densely inhabited, especially in the northern part of the hill. However, it is difficult to know how many of the hermitages were occupied simultaneously. A survey that was conducted in 2005-2006 (IFAO) on the top of the rocky plateau that rises to the west of the hill revealed clusters of hermitages, probably dating to the seventh/ eighth century AD. (Wipszycka 2018, 322-328)  
  Numerous papyri and ostraca written mainly in Coptic, but in Greek as well, provide significant information about the monastic community living in Bawit. They were discovered either during the excavations, or in museum collections.  
  The publications about the site are profuse (only a selection is included below).",390,900,1533,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2022-04-20 15:44:14.768 +0200,2022-06-27 00:30:34.091 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1386,Liumen (Liu School),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Liumen 劉門 tradition evolved from the teachings of the Confucian scholar Liu Yuan 劉沅 (1768–1856; styles: Zhitang 止唐, Neru 訥如; alias: Qingyang 清陽, Huaixuan 槐軒), who combined his Confucian erudition with the practice of Daoist self-cultivation and eventually became one of the most influential personalities in late-imperial Sichuan, commonly known as Chuanxi fuzi 川西夫子 (Master of Western Sichuan). 
Those works among Liu’s numerous writings which are representative of his Confucian erudition have been published by his descendants and students as a posthumous collection under the title Huaixuan quanshu 槐軒全書 (Collected Works from the Locust Tree Studio or Collected Works of Huaixuan). 
The leadership of the Liumen community, which developed into a quasi-religious movement during the 19th century, was handed down within the Liu family. Many temples in Sichuan were managed by the community, and most of these centers also contained charitable institutions and schools. Possibly due to its Confucian credo, the Liumen movement was not considered a heterodox sect in late Qing and Republican times, and it flourished until the middle of the 20th century. 
Being one of the most influential scholarly and spiritual traditions of Sichuan at that time, the teachings of Liu Yuan and the Liumen doctrine spread throughout the province and beyond. As an important part of civil society, Liumen was active in education, charity, religion and other realms of social and cultural life. It had many local branches and developed its own Daoist ritual tradition named Fayan tan 法言壇 (Altar of Ritual Words). 
The establishment and development of the Fayan tan tradition constitutes an important aspect of Liumen's interaction with the Daoist religion. Liu Yuan and some of his disciples edited a whole canon of Daoist ritual texts, which was titled Fayan huizuan 法言會纂 (Compendium of Ritual Words). The rituals recorded in this compilation cover the full range of religious services offered to the society of late imperial China, comprising rites for the expulsion of diseases or vermin, for pacifying the spirits of earth, water, and fire as well as offering ceremonies to various divinities, exorcisms, and funerary rituals. Considerable space is reserved for rites for ancestors and desolate souls. Each chapter includes instructions and texts for a “classified ritual” (keyi 科儀), and these rituals are combined to form the liturgical festivals of the Liumen community. 
Local Daoist priests who were affiliated with the Liumen community and used the Fayan huizuan canon in their ritual activities eventually constituted an independent liturgical branch of non-monastic Daoism and venerated Liu Yuan and the following Liumen patriarchs as ancestral masters of their lineage. Priests of the Fayan tan tradition are still active today. Liu Yuan and his community thus actively contributed to the development of modern and contemporary Sichuanese Daoism by establishing the foundations of the Fayan tan tradition. The Fayan tan liturgy still plays a significant role in the religious practice of Sichuan that can be observed today, and it continues to reflect the ethical values of the Liumen tradition. 
While only minor groups of Liumen adherents and priests of the Fayan tan tradition are still active today, the intellectual and cultural heritage of Liumen is currently ""reinvented"" as ""Huaixuan culture"" 槐軒文化 or ""School of Huaixuan Thought"" 槐軒學派 in mainland China to adapt it to the needs of CCP rule, which prohibits any activities of independent popular (religious) communities.",1807,1950,1541,1085,Volker Olles,2022-04-30 11:59:48.700 +0200,2022-05-31 04:18:07.415 +0200,Mapping Religious Diversity in Modern Sichuan
1387,Spring and Autumn annals of Master Lü,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A late Warring States text commissioned by Lü Buwei 呂不韋. According to his biography in Sima Qian’s 司馬遷Records of the Historian 史記, Lü was a wealthy merchant in his home state of Wei 衞 when he met the Qin 秦 prince Zichu 子楚, who was held as a political hostage in the northern state of Zhao 趙. When the prince ascended to the throne in 249 BCE, he appointed Lü as assistant chancellor. When the king died two years later, his young son Ying Zheng 嬴政, who succeeded him, appointed Lü as Prime Minister and Regent to the throne, a position that he held between 247 and 235 BCE. During his tenure, Lü assembled a group of retainers and visiting scholars in the Qin capital and commissioned them to create a comprehensive encyclopedic account of worldly knowledge to be used as a handbook for rulership. Often categorized as a miscellaneous 雜 text by later bibliographers, the text includes material associated with Confucian 儒, Mohist 墨, Daoist 道, and Legalist 法 and other philosophical schools of thought. While it is not associated with any specific religious tradition or institution, the text contains a detailed blueprint for an orderly and harmonious state governed by the ruler, known as the Son of Heaven 天子, in concordance with cosmic principles and natural cycles. The text includes 26 books and can be divided into three volumes: the Twelve Chronicles or Almanacs 十二紀, the Eight Examinations 覧, and the Six Discourses 論. The first volume, organized according to the twelve months of the year, provides a detailed ritual calendar for a state religion headed by the Son of Heaven, whose performance of seasonal sacrifices is integral for the wellbeing of the state, its human subjects, and the natural world around it. These rituals include the Plowing Ceremony to mark the beginning of the agricultural year, the Sericulture Ceremony led by the Queen and her retinue, the Grand Exorcism performed at the end of winter to expel all of the previous year’s misfortunes. The text is said to have played an influential role in the education of the young king, who eventually unified China and assumed the title the First Emperor of Qin 秦始皇帝. While the religious vision described in the text was never fully implemented, especially after the rather swift demise of the Qin Empire, it is believed to have served as an inspiration for the imperial religion developed during the Han Dynasty and practiced, in some form or another, until 1911.",-247,-239,1546,1100,Ori Tavor,2022-05-06 19:04:19.759 +0200,2022-05-14 22:54:31.198 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1389,Writ of the Three Sovereigns,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Writ of the Three Sovereigns was originally a key source of local Southern Jiangnan lore in China during the early medieval period. Dated to around the third century, it collected esoteric techniques that can be traced back to the “masters of methods” (fangshi), regional ritual specialists and influential court advisors from third century BCE to the third century CE. The scripture was thought to have been revealed in Antiquity by high gods to the first three rulers of China, the legendary Three Sovereigns, in order to assist them in ordering the realm and attaining the powers that came with spiritual accomplishment. 

The bulk of the text is devoted to a series of potent talismans written in a celestial script that is indecipherable to common mortals. When deployed correctly, they can summon supernatural beings ranging from local deities to high-ranking gods so that practitioners can obtain their favor, their protection, or, more commonly, to inquire about future events. The practice has a visualization component since the divine beings manifest in the mind’s eye; accordingly, some scholars term it “visionary divination.” 

Other techniques that are associated with the scripture include a meditation method that involves generating a bodily god that is a perfect embryonic version of oneself (an enchymoma) and alchemical practices that consist of crafting medicines and elixirs.

In the fifth and sixth centuries CE, the Writ of the Three Sovereigns became the centerpiece of one of the three core divisions of the nascent Daoist canon. As a result, it also became one of the foundational sources of early institutional Daoism. This propelled the text from the fairly self-contained context of local Jiangnan lore to a far broader empire-wide setting. The purported efficacy of its summoning techniques, through which, it was rumored, that deities could grant even the status of emperor or empress to practitioners, were quickly identified as potentially seditious by Tang imperial authorities. The scripture was summarily banned in 648 CE. All known copies were collected and destroyed in the capital. The text was replaced in the Daoist canon by the Scripture of the Way and Virtue (Daode jing). Nevertheless, some fragments survived in citations or manuscripts, enough that the Writ of the Three Sovereigns could be reconstructed, at least in part, by contemporary scholars.

After the ban, during the Song dynasty (960–1279), the scripture was “rediscovered” as a result of renewed interest in its practices. A highly modified version, in actuality an antiquarian reconstruction, circulated around the tenth century, enjoying significant popularity among Daoists for a few centuries. Its tenets and methods spread throughout China once again. Later on, during the late medieval or early modern periods, the Writ of the Three Sovereigns reached as far as Japan.",200,1200,1544,1160,Dominic Steavu,2022-05-11 21:07:49.084 +0200,2022-08-08 22:04:45.350 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1390,Eastern Apache,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Central Band of the Eastern Apache are a Native American group residing in what is now New Mexico. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence that reconstructs Eastern Apache life and beliefs in 1870, prior to the reservation era, at which time the Eastern Apache occupied territory west of the Rio Grande in what is now southern Arizona and New Mexico. The second half of the 19th century was marked by violent conflict between the United States government and the Eastern Apache, which ended in 1886 with the surrender of the Eastern Apache chief, Geronimo, to United States forces. Following his surrender, the Eastern Apache people were considered prisoners of war and imprisoned first in Florida, then in Alabama, and lastly, in Oklahoma. The combination of violence, imprisonment, and forced migration resulted in severe population loss among the Eastern Apache. In 1913, most of the Eastern Apache were again transferred, this time to the Mescalero Reservation in New Mexico (Beierle, 2012:2). In 1870, the Eastern Apache lived in autonomous settlements that engaged in warlike raids of both external societies and other Eastern Apache communities. Eastern Apache religion centered around the personal relationship that each individual had with a supernatural, animating principle known as “the power.” Those with especially strong relationships with the power were known as shamans. Power was believed to come from different supernatural sources, including one of many supernatural beings, and could be used for multiple reasons, from curing to cursing people. For the Eastern Apache, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1855,1880,1545,1090,Anj Droe,2022-05-12 16:50:00.018 +0200,2022-07-11 18:25:34.914 +0200,eHRAF
1391,The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia (Sparta),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The sanctuary to the goddess Orthia (later conflated with Artemis, according to an inscription from the late first century CE) was one of four sanctuaries built around Sparta in the Iron Age (1100-700 BCE). The sanctuary is located in the village of Limnai, and sits on a flat marshy hollow on the bank of the Eurotas River. The most conspicuous remains today are Roman, in particular an amphitheatre built in the third century CE, built around an earlier temple and altar dating to the sixth century BCE. The excavations in the early 1900s uncovered even earlier phases to this sanctuary, and recent reassessments of the excavation notebooks suggest the earliest structures may date back to the late ninth century BCE.

The sanctuary became known from about the fourth century BCE onwards for the harsh rituals performed on the altar at this sanctuary. Both Plato (Laws) and Xenophon (Constitution of the Lacedaemonians) discuss the training Spartan youths received, enduring harsh trials as part of the system of education known as the agoge. The oft-cited flogging of Spartan youths on the altar of Orthia is mentioned Xenophon’s Constitution of the Lakedaimonians (2.8-9) and elaborated by later authors like Plutarch. Pausanias (3.16.7-11) ties the origins of these violent rites to early conflicts by members of the original four villages of Sparta, who fell to quarrelling and bloodshed over Orthia's altar.

The excavations also uncovered a wide array of dedicated objects: ivory plaques and figurines dated primarily to the sixth century, later replaced by bone plaques and other ornaments (including votive flutes); a huge number of lead dedications, in particular lead figurines that reached the tens of thousands by the sixth and fifth centuries BCE; a corpus of clay masks dated to the sixth century representing various characters, including monsters and heroes; and other objects such as terracotta figurines and bronze figurines and jewelry.",-800,400,1547,329,Megan Daniels,2022-05-14 01:40:58.167 +0200,2022-05-14 23:35:21.254 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Their teachings spread into Syria and Asia Minor and later to Thrace. The name “Messalian” comes from the Syriac mṣallyānā, meaning “the person who prays”. The name euchitēs comes from the Greek translation of the Oriental name and means the same. The first references to Messalianism appear in the 370's in Ephrem the Syrian’s “Contra haereses”, in Epiphanius’s “Panarion” and “Ancoratus”, and later in Jerome, Atticus and Sisinnius, Archbishops of Constantinople and Theodotus of Antioch. The term “Messalianism” in fact does not refer to a specific group of people, but it was applied in a pejorative manner to any group of ascetics or monks who seemed to reject the sacramental ordinances of the Church, or who placed an emphasis on empirical aspects of prayer and demonstrated doctrinal and behavioural deviations from orthodox monastic norms. Messalians therefore were ascetics who practiced poverty, celibacy, and fasting, rejected the sacramental life of the Church and claimed that they were able to see God with their physical eyes. Messalianism was first condemned as a heresy at the Synod of Side (Pamphylia) in 388 or 390. They were finally anathematized by the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431. Messalianism and Messalian tendencies continued to exist for several centuries, influencing the Bogomils of Bulgaria and, thereby, the Bosnian Church, and Catharism. By the 12th century Messalianism had reached Bohemia and Germany and, by a resolution of the Council of Trier in 1231, was condemned as heretical. Messalians held that the essence of the Holy Trinity could be perceived by the  senses. That the Threefold God transformed himself into a single substance to unite with the souls of the perfect and that has taken different forms in order to reveal himself to the senses. Only such sensible revelations of God confer perfection upon the Christian. They also taught that, once someone experienced the essence of God, he was freed from moral obligations or ecclesiastical discipline. They had male and female teachers, the ""perfecti"", whom they honored more than the clergy.",360,900,1549,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-05-14 11:32:39.527 +0200,2022-05-18 07:48:16.614 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1393,The Ladder of Divine Ascent,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The “Ladder of Divine Ascent” is an ascetical treatise written by John of the Ladder (also called Scholasticus or Sinaites-of Sinai). John (579-650) received a general education and at the age of 16 he took monastic vows, lived as an anchorite at the foot of Mount Sinai and eventually became abbot of the monastery of St. Catherine of Sinai. The text is addressed to John, abbot of the Monastery of Raithou, who requested a text specifically for the spiritual benefit of the monks of his monastery. The treatise was inspired by the Biblical account of Jacob’s Ladder (Gen. 28:10 ff). The treatise consists of thirty chapters that represent the rungs of a ladder reaching from earth to heaven. The number thirty is symbolic of the thirty years of the “hidden life” of Jesus Christ. The idea behind this symbolism is that the monk, through his gradual spiritual ascension, may become a perfect man in the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The titles of the thirty rungs-chapters of the divine ladder are named after the virtues that a monk must pursue and cultivate, and the vices that must be banished. The distinctive feature of the treatise, which is actually the cause for its special popularity, is the particularly graphic concept of the Ladder, offering thus to the fervent monk-reader a means of ascent to heaven. The imagery of the Ladder to heaven is not a Christian invention. It operated as an allegory for spiritual development long before Christianity. John’s contribution lies on the transformation of an imagery of a rather vague allegory of spiritual progress into a practical -so to speak- spiritual exercise, by identifying each step of a monk’s effort with a particular and positive achievement. Hence, with the exception of the Scriptures and the liturgical books, no other text in Eastern Christendom has been studied, copied and translated to the same extent as the “Ladder of Divine Ascent”. It was the most widely used handbook of the ascetic life in the ancient Greek Church and became very popular among monks and laymen in both East and West. It spread across the Byzantine Empire and affected Christian spiritual leaders such as Theodore the Studite, Symeon the New Theologian, Nicetas Stethatus, the Hesychastic movement, while it was pivotal in the fifteenth-century monastic revival in Russia. In the West, the treatise enjoyed popularity especially among Franciscans, Benedictines, Cistercians, the monks of Chartreuse, who also wrote commentaries on it, and to a lesser degree among Jesuits. The text was translated in Arabic and Georgian before the tenth century, into Romanian by the early seventeenth century. A Latin translation, albeit fragmentary, appeared at least as early as the eleventh century. The first Italian translation was made in 1474. The text also appeared in Portuguese in the fourteenth century, in Spanish in 1504, in French in 1603, and in German in 1834. Furthermore, among the first books printed in America was a Spanish edition of the ""Ascent of the Divine Ladder"", published in Mexico during the sixteenth century. The first English translation appeared as late as 1858.",579,650,1550,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-05-16 19:10:45.400 +0200,2022-05-20 11:31:22.163 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1395,The First Temple in Jerusalem,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The temple is an important religious space in the context of Jerusalem. It has been destroyed, rebuilt, and appropriated by various people in its history. The First Temple, commonly referred to as Solomon’s Temple, is the first iteration of this sacred space. While there is a physical site that we know would have encompassed the first temple, most of our evidence and descriptions are textual sources stemming from the biblical text. Original artifacts from the first temple structure are no longer available. Therefore, we are reliant on textual descriptions, references and traditions concerning the space. According to these traditions the Jebusites previously controlled the location until David conquered the area. He made this area the capital of Judah and ultimately a united Israel (2 Samuel 5). David was not allowed to build the temple because he was a man of war. However, his son could build a house for YHWH (2 Samuel 7). That son was King Solomon. The Solomonic age is credited with various building projects such as a wall around Jerusalem, and fortified cities around the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. However, the temple is one of the most important because of its religious importance. The importance is clear considering the specific details of the temple (1 Kings 5–6).  Additionally, the author of Chronicles correlates the Temple with the sacred space of Mt. Moriah (2 Chronicles 3:1). Mt. Moriah was the location attributed to the story of Abraham and Isaac. This is the place where Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son, YHWH tested Abraham’s obedience and also provided a sacrifice. This provision is the source of the epithet, YHWH will provide or YHWH Yireh. This project took seven years to complete (1 Kings 6:37–38). The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high (1 Kings 6:2). Its structure was a tripartite plan. The first of the interior sections was the front often known as the portico. The second and largest area is the sanctuary or holy place. The last area was the inner sanctuary or the “Holy of Holies.” The sacred places of this tripartite plane were surrounded by various courts. This temple was most likely built during the 10th century and was destroyed in 586 B.C.E. by the Babylonians.",-950,-586,2190,1099,Stephen Ward,2022-05-18 19:36:11.509 +0200,2024-01-13 06:41:21.150 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1398,Leifeng Pagoda (Leifeng ta 雷峰塔),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Leifeng Pagoda was constructed between 971 and 977 under Qian Chu 錢俶  (r. 948-978), then-ruler of the state of Wuyue 吳越, on the shores of West Lake in Hangzhou (present-day Zhejiang province). In its original construction, the pagoda was a seven-story, octagonal structure with an interior core of brick and exterior corridors and double eaves made of wood. Beneath the structure, an underground chamber was built to house the relics of “locks of the Buddha’s hair” (Fo luokuo fa 佛螺髺髮). After sustaining damage, the Leifeng pagoda was reconstructed during the Qingyuan 慶元 era (1195-1200) of the Southern Song dynasty, when it was reduced to a five-story structure. During this time, the pagoda also gained its literary status as one of the “famous sites of Hangzhou,” under the title “Rays of Sunset at Leifeng” (雷峰夕照). During the Jiajing 嘉靖 era (1522-1566) of the Ming dynasty, the wooden exterior of the pagoda was burned away, and its silhouette became known to visitors by its exposed brick core. Throughout this period and thereafter, the pagoda became known not primarily as a Wu-Yue pagoda, but for its association with “The White Snake Legend” (白蛇傳), in which it served as the site where the “White Maiden” (白娘子) was locked away. In 1924, the brick core of the pagoda finally collapsed. The site remained in a state of ruin until March, 2000, when the two-year archaeological excavation of the site began. Undisturbed upon excavation, the pagoda’s underground chamber was found to contain fifty-one objects, including nested reliquaries, Buddhist sculptures, a gilded silver belt, jewelry, jade and glass objects, coins, mirrors, and Buddhist texts. It is believed that, in the upper part of the pagoda, an additional chamber was built to house another set of reliquaries and objects. In some parts of the pagoda body, hollow bricks were used in construction. Many of these bricks originally housed printed scrolls of the ""Dhāranī Sūtra of the Seal on the Casket"" (寶篋印陀羅尼經), many of which were collected when the pagoda collapsed in 1924. The current pagoda building at the site of Leifeng, completed in 2002, is a five-story, octagonal pagoda reconstructed to resemble the Southern Song structure.",971,2022,1553,1186,Bryce Heatherly,2022-05-22 18:17:41.224 +0200,2022-09-02 21:52:34.827 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1399,Religion in the Mittani Empire,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mittani people were composed of a Late Bronze Age Hurrian-speaking set of communities, situated in the region around the Euphrates river between modern-day Aleppo, Erbil and Diyarbakır. At its peak in the 14th century BCE, the Mittani Empire or state would have included at least Aššur, Alalaḫ, Arrapḫa, Kizzuwatna, Tunip, and probably Yamḫad and Ḫana. These were semi-independent, and sometimes ruled by their own Kings under the overlordship of Mittani with models of governance probably adapted on a case-by-case basis. 

This region has been difficult to access in recent times, which means that many potentially Mittani sites remain unexcavated and much about Mittani is still unknown. To complicate matters further, in the past data about Mittani and Assyria were often added together, and to date no large (royal) Mittani archive has been identified. A huge number of mostly economic documents is available from Nuzi, which was part of the Mittani vasal state of Arrapḫa – but it should not be assumed that any religious practices we can discern from these for Nuzi would reflect those of the entire Mittani Empire. There is only a handful of published cuneiform tablets that can be said with certainty to have been Mittani. The biggest source of information is perhaps the Mittani series of Amarna letters, and Mittani is also frequently mentioned in other contemporary letters and treaties, e.g. by the Assyrians and Hittites. Also significant are the so-called 'Assyro-Mittani' tablets found at Boğazköy, which describe witchcraft and rituals. It is usually unclear however who wrote these, when, and where – and as with Nuzi, it should not be assumed that the practices described in these texts would have consistently applied across the entire Mittani Empire.

While it is likely that the Mittani people would have primarily identified as Hurrian, not all Hurrians were Mittani. In addition, the Hurrians did not necessarily have homogenous theology, mythology, cults or rituals nor did they have a name for their religion – and as such should not be understood as a religious group. With that said – many people likely believed in a particular array of named deities, and held a related collection of beliefs with associated institutions and practices. For instance, Hurrian texts refer to an idea of heaven, earth and the underworld. The most significant Hurrian deity was the weather god Teššub. He would have yielded storm, rain, and lighting, and travelled the skies in a chariot drawn by bulls. He was joined by the goddess of love and war, Šauska, who would have played an important role e.g. blessing marriages. There were likely also a sun and mood god, Šimike and Kušuh, linked to different omens and oaths; and of course many deities, such as Nergal and Ea, borrowed from other traditions. Deities were anthropomorphic and they were given offerings. Rituals, festivals, divination and incantation all played important roles in society, and cities had temples dedicated to deities. Many more details are available about Hurrian religious beliefs, but not necessarily from Mittani sources or the Mittani period.",-1550,-1350,1554,1171,Zenobia Homan,2022-05-23 13:07:24.235 +0200,2022-11-08 23:46:52.414 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1400,The Buddhist Nuns of 4th - 6th century China,43,Religious Group (v6),"The earliest Buddhist nuns in China lived between the 4th and 6th centuries AD. We have record of their lives from Baochang’s compilation of their biographies in 516 AD. They were women who were more likely than not of elite literati familial origin. Many of them were centered around the great metropolitan cities of Chang’an and Luoyang in the North, and Jiankang in the south.

The earliest nuns adopted Buddhist ideas and practices that had been slowly entering China along the Silk Routes from Central Asia and India. In the several hundred years prior to the 4th century, Buddhism was quite limited in China, practiced more or less by residents of foreign origin. These residents were treated as marginal within the larger cultural milieu. In particular, the Han dynasty ending in 220 AD had little use for Buddhist ideas and practices, as they were heavily invested in Confucian orthodoxies concerning family, institutions, and statecraft. 

The conquest of the northern capital cities of Luoyang and Chang’an in 311 and 316 AD by a united nomadic Xiongnu alliance meant an end to Han Chinese governance in the north. Gentry who survived the massacres and book-burnings in the capital cities fled to Jiankang in the south, in present-day Nanjing, where they set up a new seat of government. This massive societal crisis threw the assured Confucian orthodoxies into disarray. In the vacuum of political theory, intellectuals held salons or qingtans to discuss speculative new forms of political and natural philosophy. This is the setting for the broader uptake and flowering of Buddhist ideas and practices, which often took the form of Buddho-Daoist syntheses.

The earliest Buddhist nuns were living in this context. In response to the social turmoil of the times, these women bucked Confucian ideas of the exemplary woman as primarily devoted to the institutions of family and, in connection with the apparatus of state, the familial-dynasty. Importantly, the institution of the family should not be seen here as a “private” arena, as it is organized in modern secular societies with a distinction between private and public. In the 4-6th centuries, the family as an institution was the primary building block of political economy. Noble houses interfaced with each other and also with an imperial apparatus of state in alliances involving power, prestige, and territorial control (ie. economic output). The family sent sons into the imperial officialdom; daughters participated in various political alliances between houses. 

This is the setting in which we can see how radical the Buddhist nuns were. They were trail-blazers innovating new practices that took care of people who fell into the interstitial spaces between the various norms, practices, and institutions of family and familial dynasty. These innovations played an important part in shifting the entire social system, introducing the institution of the sangha in addition to, and in relation with, the institutions of state and family.",300,516,1555,1187,Kathy Lin,2022-05-23 17:28:54.306 +0200,2022-06-30 17:29:30.348 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1401,"The ""On the Divine Names"" of Pseudo Denys the Areopagite",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The treatise “On the Divine Names” is written by Pseudo Denys (Dionysius) the Areopagite. The treatise extends to thirteen chapters which, when completed, leaves the reader intrigued and fascinated from the beautiful “spectacles” it contains: the infinite manifestation of God's providence; the silent reconciling effect of divine peace; the connecting power of divine eros; the undisputed dominance of the good that pervades everything; the unity of everything in the absolute one, God. Its author presents himself as Dionysius the Areopagite, originally a member of the Athenian judicial council (known as ‘the Areopagus’) in the 1st century C.E. who was converted by Paul and became his disciple (mentioned in “Acts” 17:34). For this reason, Dionysius’s writings retained the status of apostolic authority until the 19th century, when studies proved that the author was deeply influenced by the Athenian Neoplatonic school of Proclus. Hence, the treatise was written in the time of Proclus (ca. 500, since Proclus died in 485 CE and since Severus of Antioch explicitly cites Dionysius’s writings between the years 518-528) by one of his pupils, perhaps of Syrian origin, who knew enough of Platonism and the Christian tradition. The treatise is Dionysius’s longest work. It consists of thirteen chapters and deals with affirmative theology, namely, the names attributed to God in the Scripture. It furthermore explores the limits and the capacities of human language, also involving negative theology. Dionysius deals particularly with the distinction into the multiple attributes of the godhead as a whole. Although the names applied to the godhead refer to it as a unity, each name however is different and it therefore differentiates the godhead. Dionysius’s use of the prefix “over-” indicates the self-multiplication of the godhead, while the use of the prefix “pre-” indicates that God has the attributes of creatures in such a way that he transcends both creature and attribute. The so-called “Corpus Areopagiticum” became extremely popular in the Latin West when the Byzantine emperor Michael II the Stammerer (770-829) sent a copy as a gift to king Louis the Pious in 827. The first translation, made in 838 by the abbot Hilduin of the monastery of Saint Denys near Paris, was so incomprehensible that Charles II the Bald asked John Scottus Eriugena to make a new translation, completed in 862 and revised in 875. The influence of Dionysius in Eriugena’s thought is profound. Dionysius’s writings also had a profound effect in the Franciscan tradition, especially in Robert Grosseteste and Bonaventure. Dionysius’s ideas pervade not only the Italian and English Renaissance, but also the German mystical writers (Mystique rhénane; Rheinländische Mystik), such as Meister Eckhart, Jean Tauler, John van Ruysbroeck, Jean Charlier de Gerson, not to mention Nicholas of Cusa and the Spanish mystics, such as St. John of the Cross.",485,528,1556,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-05-23 17:39:11.639 +0200,2022-06-10 10:59:29.010 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1402,Nahal Mishmar cave,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Located in the Judean Desert on the west side of the Dead Sea, the Nahal Mishmar Cave, or Cave of the Treasure, have played a significant role in discussions on Chalcolithic religion and cult in the southern Levant. The cave is renown for its cache of over 400 lost-wax-cast copper objects, which included mace heads, scepters and standards, weapons and tools, as well as cult objects carved from hippopotamus and elephant ivory, beads of imported and local stone, and a domestic assemblage. Iconographically, objects in the hoard reflect the sharing of motifs on other ritual objects such as cult stands, ceramic ossuaries, and metal standards found in other burial cave assemblages throughout the southern Levant. Regarding the dating of the hoard and the period of its deposition, the objects were placed under a reed mat whose radiocarbon dates returned results ranging from 4350-3500 BCE, leading to debate on when the hoard was deposited and by whom. Additionally, ceramic sherds dated to the EB IB demonstrate reoccupation of the cave during the late fourth millennium, further complicating the picture. Analysis of some of the copper objects reveals the metal was both local, possibly from the Feinan region, as well as imported from much further abroad, reflecting far-reaching exchange networks. Both the production techniques employed to cast the tools and ceremonial objects and the objects themselves find parallels in the Beersheba settlements, which has led some to propose a Ghassulian connection while others reject such proposals. Given the wealth in material, the cultic nature of the objects, and the proximity to En Gedi, David Ussishkin advocated for a connection to the cultic shrine 10 km south of the cave; other scholars debate this proposal in favor for a range of other possibilities. Nevertheless, the cave and the hoard have come to play role in the study of Chalcolithic religion.",-4350,-3100,1558,844,Nadia Ben-Marzouk,2022-05-27 22:24:23.227 +0200,2023-06-21 09:28:03.846 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1403,En Gedi ritual complex,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The En Gedi cultic complex is one of several important places providing evidence for understanding the religious beliefs and practices of “Ghassulian” communities during the Chalcolithic (other important sites include Teleilat Ghassul, Gilat, the Cave of the Treasure, and Shiqmim). The cultic complex is located on a rocky promenade 700 m above the En Gedi oasis on the west bank of the Dead Sea and was first identified by Y. Aharoni in 1956 during survey and later excavated under J. Naveh (1957), B. Mazar (1961) and D. Ussishkin (1962, 1964). The site’s layout comprises two rectangular buildings whose entrances face inward toward a circular stone installation in the center of an open courtyard, and a stone fence connecting these structures with two entrance points, one of which contains evidence for a door (Ussishkin 1980: 4-14). The artifact assemblage is non-domestic in nature, consisting predominantly of different sized bowls, cornets, ibex and deer horn, goat bones, non-marine mollusks, and partial figurines of a bull laden with two churns and a serpent (Ussishkin 1980: 18-26; Gilead 2002: 110-111).  Architecturally the layout is similar to the early Chalcolithic Area E temple at Teleilat Ghassul (Bourke 2001) and the EB I temple at Megiddo (Ussishkin 1980:29, with references; 2014). Unfortunately, no radiocarbon dates were collected during excavation resulting in debates over when the complex was constructed and abandoned (compare Ussishkin 1980:29-30 to Gošić 2016: 875-876). However, the presence of an alabaster jar imported from Egypt typologically dates to the fourth millennium BCE supporting a later date of (re)occupation (Ussishkin 1980: 21-25, with references).   

The function of the En Gedi cultic complex and its associated practices remain debated. The excavator interpreted the larger building as a sanctuary/temple and the smaller building as a priests’ quarters/storeroom (Ussishkin 1971, 1980, 2014). While the site lacks any actual evidence of storage, Ussishkin (1971:38-39; 1980; 2014) maintained the hoard of 400+ copper objects from the Cave of the Treasure at Nahal Mishmar, 10 km south of En Gedi, was the cultic equipment hidden by the En Gedi temple priests during their abandonment of the site (Ussishkin 1971, 1980). In terms of cultic practices, the circular stone installation has generated debate on whether it was linked to ritual practices associated with water cult (Ussishkin 1980: 34-35) or marked the place of a sacred tree (Mazar 2000; Chanteau 2014). Various proposals have also discussed the possibility of a deity being worshipped on site, rending the En Gedi cultic complex as place of pilgrimage (e.g., Ussishkin 1980: 37, 2014; Amiran 1981; Gilead 2002; Arav 2014; Gošić 2016). 

Another proposal by D. Ilan and Y. Rowan (2015) builds from theory that central places are part of larger landscapes and seeks to understand En Gedi within its Judean Desert context (see also Rowan and Ilan 2007 and Ilan and Rowan 2012). They propose the Judean Desert formed a mortuary landscape wherein the En Gedi complex functioned as a mortuary shrine for the preparation and associated rituals connected with the primary burial of the dead in the Judean Desert caves  (Ilan and Rowan 2015: 182, 184). Noting the combination of mortuary shrine and funerary landscape on the west side of large body of water is a practice attested in Egypt during the Predynastic, they raised the question whether “one culture group inform(ed) the other?” (Ilan and Rowan 2015: 184). This question was further explored, developed, and supported by N. Ben-Marzouk (2020). 

The En Gedi cultic complex is therefore not only important for understanding the Chalcolithic practices and religious beliefs of communities in the southern Levant, but also potentially how these practices may have influenced—or been practiced by— communities in contact.",-4000,-3800,1559,844,Nadia Ben-Marzouk,2022-05-28 01:19:49.081 +0200,2023-10-25 12:23:11.267 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1404,Religion in Nabataea,43,Religious Group (v6),"Religion in Nabataea was a confluence of native and foreign deities and practices which spread across the Arabian desert. Ranging from the worship of betyl blocks to figural sculpture, sacred high places to Greco-Roman temples, priestly worship in sacred places to traveling pocket-sized 'eye-idols,' religious practice adapted readily to the many needs of its people and the cultural heterogeneity which permeated the region. While the concept of a “Nabataean religion” is inauthentic, a general understanding of the polytheistic religious practice within the area controlled by the Nabataean king can be reconstructed from material evidence and the few remaining literary sources. Aniconic blocks are the most common aspect of Nabataean worship, in Petra and throughout the region. These rectangular blocks, sometimes including eye stones or engravings called ‘eye-idols,’ were often dedicated to the primary deities of Nabataean polytheism, specifically Dushara and al-Uzza. Ritual feasting was also an important aspect of religious tradition, as was common in other Near Eastern and Semitic religious groups. These feasts took place commonly in triclinia as part of sacrificial and funerary ceremonies. Sacrifices, perhaps of live animals, but more likely of clay figurines, were fundamental aspects of these ceremonies.

Egyptian, Persian, and Greco-Roman influences were clearly prominent in the art and architecture of main Nabataean cities, including figural depictions of deities which was unusual for the aniconic traditions of the Nabataeans. While foreign deities were often amalgamated with Nabataean deities, such as Dushara-Zeus-Dionysus and al-Uzza-Isis-Aphrodite Ourania, the syncretization remained largely in public urban spaces. In practice, religious traditions seem to have remained unchanged even with the on-going contact with foreigners. Few foreign influences have been found in private spaces, sacred high places, or rural areas. 

As Nabataeans spread into the Mediterranean, for political and economic purposes during the later part of the Hellenistic period, their worship of the high god Dushara traveled with them. Cultic sites and altars dedicated to Dushara have been found as far away as Puteoli, Italy. This is likely due to the strong connection between Nabataean kingship and Dushara. While the king played a role in religious practice, much still remains unknown about the roles of worshippers and the organization of religion in Nabataea due to the lack of written records by contemporary, Nabataean sources.",-300,450,1560,1188,Anna Accettola,2022-05-28 18:47:59.563 +0200,2022-05-28 18:49:38.852 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1405,Asketikon,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The “Asketikon” of St. Basil the Great, bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, is a text that aims to define the way of life of the monks in the coenobitic (communal) monastic system and to set conditions of behavior and conduct within the monastery. The text was originally composed for the members of the monastery that Basil founded in ca. 356 on the banks of the river Iris in Cappadocia.  Before forming this monastic community, Basil traveled to the great monastic centers of his time in Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Palestine in order to witness for himself the manner of life led by the monks in these countries. He observed that the monastic life tended to become exceedingly seclusive and he felt that there was a danger for this kind of monasticism to fall into extreme habits and practices. He believed that communal life is better than the anchoretic-hermitical life. It corresponds better to human nature, for love of neighbor is best lived out in communal life, allowing thus the monks to easily fulfill the commandment of Christ. Hence, upon his return to Cappadocia, Basil formed his monastery and deliberately set himself against these tendencies.  Τhe “Asketikon” therefore is a series of rules that regulates the day-to-day life of the monks, down to the smallest detail, settles practical affairs and solves questions and issues of the monastic practice. With the “Asketikon” Basil laid down principles which guide both the abbots (or superiors) and the monks in their conduct. The Bible is the basis of all monastic legislation, the true Rule. The “Asketikon” is divided into two parts: the “Greater Monastic Rules” (Regulae fusius tractatae) and the “Lesser Rules” (Regulae brevius tractatae). In 397, Rufinus, the translator of the “Asketikon” into Latin, united the two into a single Rule under the name of “Regulae sancti Basilii episcopi Cappadociae ad monachos”. From the 5th century Eastern monasticism generally modelled itself almost exclusively on Basil’s Rules. Moreover, the Rules were a major source for the Rule of St. Benedict of Nursia (AD 480–550), who is regarded as the founder of Western monasticism.",358,364,1561,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-05-30 16:59:59.367 +0200,2022-06-01 12:31:35.994 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1406,Barlaam and Ioasaph,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Barlaam and Ioasaph is the legend of two mythical saints, enjoying remarkable popularity in the literatures of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. It exists in dozens of versions. The legend takes place sometime after apostle Thomas evangelized India. It narrates the story of the Indian prince, Ioasaph, son of the pagan king Abenner, a persecutor of the Christian Church. Ioasaph despite his father’s confinement to a palace for being isolated from contact with Christians, embraces the religion after being taught by monk Barlaam. Abenner troubled by his son’s conversion engages in more severe acts of persecutions and makes several unsuccessful attempts to make Ioasaph recant his faith. As a last resort, he tries to seduce Ioasaph with power and glory by letting him reign over the half of his kingdom. The secular, yet holy life of his son inspires conversion to Abenner who lives his last days as ascetic. After the death of Abenner, Ioasaph reigns during few more years but he then renounces his kingdom. He wanders for years through wilderness and finally finds Barlaam. After their death, their relics revered as holy are moved to the capital of the Indian kingdom where numerous miracles are performed.
The story goes back to Indian legends about the life of Buddha, but it is impossible to establish a single source. From India, the legend emerged in the Arab-speaking world between 750 and 900 CE and was later translated before 900 CE into Georgian. This version was used by Euthymios the Athonite († 1028), cofounder of the monastery of Iviron on Mount Athos, for the Byzantine Greek translation assumed to have been completed shortly thereafter 985 CE. By 1019 CE the Greek revised version of the text was also in circulation. The legend was popularised in the West via a Latin translation known as the “Vulgate” and was soon adapted into several vernacular versions. Some of them derive from the Latin “Vulgate”, while others were adapted from the thirteenth-century CE abbreviated version found in Jacobus de Voragine’s Legenda Aurea. The surviving witnesses of the different versions of the text that have come down to us are numerous. A small minority among them has received cycles of illustrations.
Barlaam and Ioasaph includes a set of allegorical stories (or apologues) woven into the narrative framework of the text. These apologues were disseminated independently from it and can be found in many well-known European literary works, such as collections of fables or short stories like the Disciplina clericalis and Bocaccio’s Decameron, plays like Shakespeare’s The merchant of Venice and many others. Depictions inspired by the apologues are another proof of the wide dissemination of these apologues, since they can be found in different religious and secular monuments throughout Europe.",750,1700,1571,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-05-31 10:03:00.864 +0200,2022-06-06 05:21:30.125 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1409,Formative Olmec,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Olmec civilization thrived in what is now the present-day Gulf Coast of Mexico. They developed religious and artistic traditions that extended far and wide into ancient Mesoamerica during the Formative/pre-Classic period. The Olmec developed regal-ritual centers with main plazas, pyramids, and public spaces near naturally sacred places (e.g., springs, water sources, caves) so that the general population could congregate for ceremonial religious rituals. The Olmec practiced shamanism and had an organized priesthood. The Olmec elite, shamans, and priests were at the top of the social hierarchy and were in charge of maintaining their religious and cultural traditions. There have been six Olmec supernatural beings or deities identified by Mesoamerican scholars, and while their names are not known, they have been numbered I through VI and associated with natural phenomena including: sky, fertility, rain, earth, agriculture and maize. We know a lot about Olmec religion thanks to their impressive and unique artistic traditions, as well as from later Mesoamerican religious traditions that borrowed Olmec concepts, ideology, and iconography and turned these into their own religious traditions, such as the Maya society. Due to this, the Olmec has been described as the ""Mother culture"" of Mesoamerica and is known as the first organized religion in this particular region of the Americas.",-1500,-400,1565,1106,Diana Moreiras,2022-06-02 23:36:25.491 +0200,2022-07-07 23:08:00.935 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1413,The Early Christian basilicas of Amathous,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Amathous, on the south coast of Cyprus, was an ancient city and one of the ancient royal cities of the island, which became home to the homonymous bishopric in the 4th century CE. Among the city’s impressive remains are the five Early Christian basilicas. 
The first, situated at the Acropolis of the city was uncovered by the French Archaeological mission in 1975. This is the latest of the Amathous basilicas built during the late 6th or the early 7th century CE on the foundations of the temple of Aphrodite, destroyed by an earthquake in the 6th century CE. The three-aisled basilica (25m by 24m) with the opus sectile flooring, the wall and apse mosaics and the champlevé revetments possessed a narthex, an exonarthex and several annexes. A stairway was connecting the west side of the building to the gallery above the side aisled and the narthex. The complex included additional rooms, a large cistern, and a rainwater catchment system. The basilica was abandoned at the end of the 7th century CE, prior to its destruction, for unknown reasons.
The other four basilicas were excavated by the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus. The three aisled basilica (nave and aisles: 11.5m by 17m), partially built into the bedrock at the base of the Acropolis, west of the Agora, was excavated in 1961. It was dated to the end of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century CE. The basilica possessed a narthex and an exonarthex and an apsidal chapel, adjacent to the south side. The walls featured mosaic and marble decoration. The south nave was adorned with reliefs depicting a hunting scene, dated to the mid-5th to the early 6th century CE. The floor of the sanctuary was paved with opus sectile.
The great three-aisled basilica at the east of the Agora was excavated at the beginning of the 1990’s. It was dated to the second half of the 5th century CE and is believed that it was destroyed by the Arabs between 653-654 CE. It seems that renovation has taken place soon after its destruction, while the church continued being used for some decades. This is one of the largest basilicas of Cyprus (c. 1750m2), built on the foundations of an earlier phase. The basilica possessed a baptistery, a narthex and atrium at the west side. The three aisles were paved with opus sectile. 
The oldest of the Amathous basilicas is the one dedicated to saint Tychon († c.425 CE), second bishop of Amathous. This is the only shrine of the island dedicated to the saint. It was excavated between 1991 and 1995. Located extra muros, north of the east gate of Amathous and adjoining a necropolis, the building which still stands today dates to the Frankish period (late 14th-early 15th century CE). The two prior phases are going back to the Early Christian period: Phase I from the late 4th or early 5th century CE; Phase II from the second half of the 5th century CE. The initial three-aisled building is most likely similar in size to the basilica at the base of the Acropolis, although it is difficult to clearly distinguish all the elements of the initial church. In Phase II, which may date around the death of saint Tychon in 450 CE, was erected the largest three-aisled basilica that included a martyrium. The basilica was destroyed during the Arab raids of 653-654 CE. It was repaired and remained in use until the 13th century CE. It was abandoned for a small period, before the erection of the Frankish church.
The small five-aisled basilica of saint Barbara, in the east of Amathous, was uncovered between 1973 1974. Although its dedication is unknown, it was named after the nearby cave dedicated to saint Barbara. The sanctuary had mosaic flooring. It may have been a destination for the infirm as evidenced by the archaeological findings representing human parts. The presence of adjoining spaces, cisterns and an olive pressing suggest that the church belonged to a monastery. The basilica was likely constructed between the 5th and the 6th century CE.",300,800,1569,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-06-05 14:04:43.248 +0200,2022-06-05 14:12:22.475 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1415,Anomeans,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Anomoeans was a religious group of the 4th century that represented an extreme form of Arianism. Arius and his followers, who formed the heresy of Arianism, believed that the essential difference between God and Christ was that God had always existed, while Christ was created by God. The Anomeans distorted the phraseology of the Nicene Creed the “Son of God, the only begotten of the Father” to mean that the Father as unbegotten and the Son being begotten made God the Father the source of the Son; therefore Father and Son are unalike (ανόμοιοι). Founder of the Anomoeans was Aëtius of Antioch, a man of lowly origins who worked as a vine-dresser, a goldsmith and a traveling doctor, until the year 350, when he was ordained a deacon by Leontius of Antioch. Aëtius held that God and Christ could not be alike. Since ingenerateness consists a crucial part of the essence of God, Christ could not be like God because he lacked this essential quality. The second leader of the Anomeans was Eunomius. This latter studied theology at Alexandria under Aëtius, and afterwards came under the influence of Eudoxius of Antioch, who ordained him deacon. He became Bishop of Cyzicus in 360. His works have been recovered from Basil of Caesarea’s and Gregory of Nyssa’s Contra Eunomium. Eunomius’s principal belief was the ingenerateness (ἀγεννησία) of God the Father. Being ingenerated, the Father could never come into contact or communicate His nature to generated beings. Therefore the Son is generated (γεννητός), created by the power of the Ingenerated Father. After his exposition of faith to emperor Theodosius in 383 Eunomius was sent into exile in Caesarea until his death in 394. His followers, condemned at the Council of Constantinople in 381, were called Anomoeans for they denied any substantial similarity between the Father and the Son. Since 398 several imperial edicts forbade the possession of his writings and holders of their copies were advised to burn them.",350,398,1573,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-06-07 11:14:07.369 +0200,2022-06-08 18:51:30.356 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1416,Mount Athos,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastic Community of Mount Athos is geographically defined by the boundaries of the Athos peninsula, the easternmost leg of the larger Chalkidiki peninsula, being a self-governing community within the Greek territory. Mount Athos is a living worshiping and hesychastic community with continuous and uninterrupted presence that spans over a millennium. It consists of twenty sovereign Monasteries, skētes (smaller communities of Christian hermits with a common area of worship), cells and kathismata (units with a small church operated by the monks living under the spiritual and administrative supervision of a monastery) scattered throughout the peninsula. For more than a thousand years successively, the Holy Mountain operates as one of the most important cultural conservatories for both the Orthodox Christian and the Greek civilization. Directly and tangibly associated with the Byzantine world in all of its religious and cultural manifestations, the twelve-century years old monastic community constitutes a living record of human activities, preserving an enormous wealth of historic, artistic and cultural elements. At the end of the 9th century, there were many hermits and small monastic communities on Athos. However, most of the monks were still hermits, living in improvised huts, eating the fruits of wild trees, and suffering the effects of frequent pirate raids. This situation changed with the arrival of St. Athansius the Athonite. In 961, Athanasios began to build the Great Lavra, a monastery to which the Emperor Nikephoros Phokas himself retired in his old age. Athanasius’s vigorous building activity provoked the opposition of most of the ascetics, who accused him before Emperor John Tsimiskes of corrupting the character of Mount Athos. The Emperor responded with an imperial chrysobull, the “Tragos”, which is the oldest document bearing an imperial signature. The “Tragos” was the first rule for Mount Athos, and lent further support to what Athanasius was doing. By the time he died in 1000, Athanasius not only had constructed the large and imposing group of buildings that make up the Great Lavra, but he had also secured sufficient funding to maintain the monastery and laid the foundations of coenobitic monasticism. In the 11th and 12th centuries, Mount Athos became one of the most important monastic centers in the Byzantine Empire. Many monasteries were founded and the Byzantine emperors issued ""chrysobulls"" and ""sigillia"" granting numerous privileges and vast tracts of farmland. At the time when the monastic communities in Asia Minor were being wiped out by Seljuk Turk raids, the monasteries on Mount Athos were flourishing and their landed property was constantly increasing, as was their influence. Mount Athos is a self-governed part of the Greek state, subject to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its political aspect and to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in regards of its religious aspect. The Greek State is represented by the Governor of Mount Athos, who answers to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and who, together with the deputy governor, resides in the capital of Mount Athos, the village of Karyes. He ensures that the Charter is respected, attends the sessions of the Holy Community in an advisory capacity, and presides over local public services (police, customs, etc.). All women without exception are forbidden to enter to Mount Athos. Mount Athos has been divided into twenty self-governed territories. Each territory consists of a cardinal monastery and some other monastic establishments that surround it. All the monasteries are communes (of a convent nature). That means that there is common liturgy, prayer, housing, nourishing and work among the monks. The Abbot of the monastery, being elected by the monks for life, is responsible for the affairs of the monastery.",960,2022,1574,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-06-10 08:19:30.099 +0200,2022-06-14 06:48:19.772 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1417,Taiyi sheng shui 太一生水,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Taiyi sheng shui 太一生水 is a fourth century BCE Chu 楚  manuscript written on 14 bamboo slips, discovered in 1993 in the archaeological excavation of the Guodian 郭店 tomb n.1, in Jingmen 荊門, Hubei 湖北 province. It has been given the title Taiyi sheng shui by the editors of the Guodian Chu mu zhujian 郭店楚墓竹簡, based on the first four characters written on what is deemed to be the first strip. The text, written in the Chu script, appears to be divided into two main halves, and the debate is still open as to whether they represent two sections of a consistent text or two separate documents. The first half describes a cosmological cycle that begins with Taiyi making water alive and ends with the the completion of a yearly cycle, through a process of reciprocal assistance by a series of dyadic couples (the sky and the earth, shen 神 and ming 明, yin and yang, the four seasons, cold and warmth, wetness and dryness); the second half deals with various topics: the workings of the tiandao 天道 (way of the sky); the different designations assigned to Taiyi 太一, the “Great One”,  whose names, ming 名, are qing 清 (bright) and hun 昏 (dark), and whose honorific, zi 字, is dao 道 (way);  the services performed by the sage and by the people, who both need to rely on the names of Taiyi; the tilt that occurred between the sky and earth, whereby the sky is insufficient in the north-west, while the earth is insufficient in the south-east (a recurring account on the asset of the sky and the earth in Chu texts, e.g. Tianwen 天問).
The Taiyi sheng shui appears to share the same material carrier with one of the three Laozi 老子 manuscripts found in the same tomb, the Guodian Laozi C 郭店老子丙, and for this reason the majority of scholarly works hypothesize a correspondence of Taiyi to the Laozian dao. This supposed connection between the two texts led to an understanding of the first half of the Taiyi sheng shui as a cosmogony connected to the cosmogonic chapters of the Daodejing 道德經 (ch. 25;42), despite the process ending with the completion of the year (cheng sui 成歲) rather than with the coming into being of material reality. Within this framework, Taiyi in this text has been understood as a name for the dao (Allan 2003; Cook 2012; Brindley 2019; Wang 2016), as the homonymous god known from Han religious cults (Harper 2001), as a name for the pole star and its god (Allan 2003). A recent study (Puglia 2021) reads the two halves of the manuscript as a consistent whole, in which Taiyi is a name for the sun that apparently moves along with the seasons in the sky, marking the completion of the year, and tracing the tiandao that people should understand in order to act timely and get accomplishments done. The identification of Taiyi with the sun in this manuscript is based on the detailed description of its movements provided in the text. It is said to proceed with the seasons (行於時), to make a cycle and begin anew (周而又始), and to hide in water (藏於水): the employment of the verbs xing 行 and zhou 周, tipically used to define the sun’s motion in astronomical pre-Qin and early imperial accounts (e.g. Lüshi Chunqiu 呂氏春秋, Huainanzi 淮南子, etc.) recalls the completion of the yearly cycle as the end of the cosmology described in the first half of the manuscript; the hiding in water, on the other hand, parallels the topos of the sun disappearing in water at sunset in the Chu tradition (e.g. Tianwen 天問). Also the names qing and hun given to Taiyi, following Donald Harper’s reading  of the same characters in the Mawangdui 馬王堆 medical text entitled Quegu Shiqi 卻鼓食氣, indicate dawn and dusk (Harper 2001), while its honorific dao might refer to the sun’s ecliptic, the huangdao 黃道 (simply referred to as dao in other pre-imperial sources, such as the Lüshi Chunqiu). Taiyi is also defined as the mother of the ten thousand things (萬物母): if Taiyi is the sun, this passage would refer to its essential function of ensuring the conditions for the existence and reproduction of things on earth, providing light and heat, and driving the water cycle (also explaining the fundamental role of shui 水, water, in the manuscript). Taiyi is finally said to weave making the warp of the ten thousand things (以紀為萬物經): the sun was traditionally taken both as a spatial and as a temporal benchmark for all things on earth, based on the directions of its rising and setting and on the regularity of its yearly cycle.
According to this reading, the two halves of the text are consistent with each other: the first half provides a clarification of the various steps which cooperate for the completion of the year, which is marked by the apparent revolution of the sun in the sky. This revolution of the sun recalls the tiandao of the second half of the text, on which people should base their activities.",-400,-300,1413,1195,Francesca Puglia,2022-06-14 12:54:33.624 +0200,2022-06-18 12:21:20.416 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1418,Book of Jonah,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Book of Jonah is a text within the Hebrew Bible, specifically within the Book of the Twelve Minor Prophets, describing the prophet Jonah ben Amittai's journey to and experience in Nineveh. 

The text is preserved in Hebrew and in Greek, with some small differences between the texts. Major themes within the text include prophetic disobedience, true and false prophecy, Gentile piety, repentance, and divine freedom.

The content of the text consists of God commanding Jonah to go to Nineveh because the city's wickedness has come up before God. Jonah attempts to flee God's commission by taking a boat. God sends a storm upon the sea, and the sailors realise that Jonah is the cause. They eventually throw Jonah overboard, he is swallowed by a fish, and he prays to God. The fish vomits Jonah onto dry land and he goes to Nineveh and very briefly proclaims its overthrow. The people of Nineveh repent, and God spares the city. Jonah seems displeased that they are spared and has a conversation with God about the justification for his anger.

The text is set in the pre-exilic period when Israel survived as a state. However, it is most likely written considerably later in a post-exilic climate.",-800,-200,1576,1145,Marian Kelsey,2022-06-16 12:32:03.204 +0200,2022-11-15 15:26:36.351 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

During this period, which approximately goes from the reign of the dynasty founder Ahmose to that of Thutmosis III (ca. 1550–1425 BCE), Egypt became a world power, expanding its influence and control in Near East and Nubia through a series of military campaigns. As a consequence, the pharaohs began to control significant wealth, which they largely bestowed on their gods, especially the theban god Amon (also knows as Amon-Ra given its fusion with the sun god Ra).

1420,Creek,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Creek (preferred name “Mvskoke Creek”) is a multiethnic Native American society composed of multiple tribes, the majority of which currently reside in Oklahoma, in the United States of America. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence that reconstructs Creek life and beliefs in 1800, prior to the reservation era, at which time the Creek lived in what is now Georgia and eastern Alabama. Beginning in 1680 and continuing through 1830, the Creek formed and maintained a powerful coalition of four main tribes, known as the Creek Confederacy. As relations with the United States grew more strained following the Revolutionary War, the Creek Confederacy was forced to cede land and move to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in the 1830s. In 1898, the tribal governments were forced to dissolve. Most members of the Mvskoke Creek remain in Oklahoma today. In 1800, when the Creek Confederacy was still in power, contact with other cultures occurred primarily through warfare, or through missionary presence in the region. However, most of the Creek still practiced the traditional indigenous religion. While a supreme high god was present, Creek religion was primarily focused on a diverse assortment of non-human supernatural beings, many of whom took the form of animals. All sentient beings, as well as some inanimate objects (including geographical features) were believed to possess a spiritual soul, and a spiritual power was believed to be ubiquitous. This power was used by religious leaders for primarily healing and other medical purposes, so much so that medicine and religion were essentially inseparable. For the Creek, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1785,1810,1578,1090,Anj Droe,2022-06-16 22:42:36.969 +0200,2022-07-14 16:17:40.891 +0200,eHRAF
1421,Tian wen 天問,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Tianwen 天問 (“Heavenly questions”) is a long poem structured in a series of questions (wen 問) directly asked to Heaven (tian 天) or concerning heavenly matters, included in the ancient poetry collection entitled Chuci 楚辭 (“Songs of Chu”, often translated into English as “Songs of the south”). Alternative translation for the title Tian wen, besides “Heavenly questions”, are “Asking Heaven” and “Heaven asks”. The poem is attributed to the 4th century BCE Chu 楚 state official and poet Qu Yuan 屈原 (340–278 BCE), yet his authorship of the poem as a whole is debated. The broad range of topics treated and their loose arrangement (possibly due to the mixing up of the slips in the original bamboo copy of the text) support the hypothesis of a collective authorship. Field advances the thesis that Qu Yuan, during one of his trips to Qi, collected diversified fragments circulating at the Ji Xia 稷下 and put them together forming the Tian wen (Field 1986). Hinton suggests that Qu Yuan, in writing the Tian wen, might have drawn most of the material from ancient oral sources (Hinton 2009).
The Eastern Han 東漢 (25 CE – 220 CE) poet and librarian Wang Yi 王逸 (fl. 130–140 CE), claiming to have based on Liu Xiang’s 劉向 (79 CE - 8 CE) text, edited the first Chuci anthology with a commentary, the Chuci zhangju 楚辭章句, transmitted in the received version, compiled in the 12th century CE, under the title Chuci buzhu 楚辭補注. Wang Yi’s edition of the Chuci is preserved in the received text, and comprises both a general foreword and several distinct introductions specific for each of the various works, in which he ascribes the Tianwen and other poems, such as the Li sao 離騷, to Qu Yuan. Regarding Qu Yuan’s inspiration for the writing of the poem, Wang Yi refers to an anecdote that allegedly occurred during the author's exile, an episode that is generally considered not to be historically reliable: according to Wang Yi’s introduction (or rather, according to the source to which the commentator refers), the author would have been inspired by seeing murals depicting spirits, deities, landscapes, mythological characters, and more, painted on the walls of the Chu ancestral temple, and would have written these questions on the same walls (Chuci zhangju, Tianwen zhangju 天問章句). Also in Sima Qian’s 司馬遷 Shiji 史記 the Tian wen is ascribed to Qu Yuan.
Regarding its structure and content, the Tianwen lists circa 170 enigmatic and mysterious questions, which remain unanswered, directed to Heaven. It consists of about 370 tetrasyllabic lines arranged in around 90 quatrains, of which the even lines rhyme. On a general level, but there are various exceptions, two lines form a semantic unity, in which the first one introduces the topic, while the second one asks the actual question. In contradistinction to all the other poems attributed to Qu Yuan, in the Tian wen the nonce word xi 兮 is completely absent, fueling skepticism about his authorship of the work. The language is archaic as nowhere else in the Chuci, with the exception of few lines of the Li sao. The topics of the diverse lines are extremely varied and range from cosmogonic matters to the actions of divine and mythological beings and religious beliefs. The poem is traditionally divided into three sections, at least starting from the Tang dynasty 唐 (618-907) times, that separate heavenly, earthly, and human matters (although different commentators divide the poem differently). The first section is concerned with cosmogonic myths and theories, cosmology, and celestial mechanics (e.g. the unaccountability of the origins of the world, the sun and moon’s celestial motion, the stars’ array, etc.); the second section’s focus is put on the asset of earth (e.g. the flood myth, the tilt between the sky and earth resulted from Kang Hui’s 康回 anger, Yi’s 羿 shooting at the suns, etc.); the third and last section refers to the deeds and achievements of legendary characters and to human events (e.g. Yu’s 禹 vicissitudes, the decline of the Xia 夏 dynasty, Nüwa’s 女娲 myth, etc.). Of the questions asked, although for none is an answer offered in the text, some appear to possibly have a knowledgeable answer, while for others a sharp skepticism on the part of the author is evident. It is the case, for example, of the opening verses of the first section: 

遂古之初，誰傳道之？At the beginning of distant antiquity, who transmitted the account?
上下未形，何由考之？When above and below had not yet achieved form, how could it be examined?
冥昭瞢暗，誰能極之？When darkness and brightness were confused and indiscernible, who could tell them apart? 

The poem is almost unique in his genre of listing unanswered questions. The only comparable literary work consisting of a list of riddles on a similar subject, yet considerably shorter, is found in the opening lines of chapter Tian yun 天運 (“Heaven’s revolution”) of the Zhuangzi 莊子.",-340,140,1272,1195,Francesca Puglia,2022-06-17 16:19:14.606 +0200,2022-07-12 17:13:47.161 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1422,Defense of Icon Veneration by John of Damascus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The three treatises on the holy icons by St. John of Damascus were written during the first phase of the iconoclastic conflict, between the years 726 and 730-731 CE, on the occasion of the uproar caused in Byzantium after the issue of a decree by the emperor Leo III the Isaurian, which forbade the faithful to kneel in front of the holy icons and ordered that the icons should be hanged higher, so that it would not be possible to worship them. Despite the careful wording of the first decrees issued by emperor Leo, the rage of the iconoclasts against the holy icons did not take long to show its true face, as they were also opposed to the veneration of the Virgin Mary and the relics of the saints. Thus, iconoclasm took on explosive proportions and afflicted Byzantium and the Orthodox Church for more than 110 years. Among the reactions provoked by emperor Leo's measures against the holy icons were the intense theological debates, in which John of Damascus took part. John was a monk, priest, hymnographer, and apologist. He was born and raised in Damascus circa 675 to a prominent Damascene Christian Arab family. His father, Sarjun ibn Mansur, served as an official of the early Umayyad Caliphate. John was a savant, whose fields of interest and contribution included law, theology, philosophy, and music. He became a priest and monk at Mar Saba monastery near Jerusalem and undertook a spirited defence of the holy images in three separate treatises. The earliest among these works is his “Apologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Images”. The purpose of this first treatise was not to defeat the rival iconoclasts, but to offer a helping hand to the truth. However, because the content of his treatise was not properly understood, John was motivated to write a second treatise shortly following a second decree issued by emperor Leo. John wrote a third treatise in late 730 or early 731, where he attempted a more systematic account of the teaching on the holy icons, the veneration of the Virgin Mary, the saints and the holy relics. According to Damascene, the iconoclastic notions that the miracles, passions and achievements of Christ and the saints are not allowed to be depicted, is nothing but an evil inspiration, as are all heresies. In the case of the holy icons, the devil envies man because, by honouring the holy icons he can see the image of Christ and be sanctified through Him. According to Damascene, the purpose for which the holy icons are made is to reveal and show things that refer to the invisible reality, for which direct and complete knowledge cannot be otherwise accessed. This is considered an aid for one’s spiritual benefit and, ultimately, salvation. The concept of “holy icon” includes inter alia the following types: the “physical” image because the physical existence comes first and then the imitation follows. More specifically, and as far as the holy icons are concerned, the first natural and unchanging image of the invisible God is his Son, Jesus Christ, who revealed the Father through himself. Another kind of image is man, who was created in the image and likeness of God. In addition, there is the painted image, which represents shapes, forms and types of the invisible and incorporeal in a perceptible way, in order to obtain a vague idea of God and the angels, since it is impossible to perceive and understand the incorporeal without figures. There are also the icons that represent religious events, miracles or virtues in order to be preserved in the memory of the faithful and as a glorification for those who excelled in virtue. Damascene concludes that we worship only God creator, for the veneration given to the icon passes over to its prototype. Decades after John Damascene’s death, presumably at Mar Saba monastery on 4 December 749, his writings would play an important role during the Second Council of Nicaea (787), which was convened in order to settle the icon dispute.",726,730,1579,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-06-18 17:30:39.531 +0200,2022-06-21 18:14:30.799 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1424,Santian neijie jing 三天內解經,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The “Scripture of the Inner Explanation of the Three Heavens” (DZ 1205), in two juan, is a text of the southern Celestial Masters that can be dated around the beginning of the Liu-Song dynasty. Its first juan, translated by S. Bokenkamp, expounds the basic worldview of the group, outlining the creation of the universe through the Dao and Lord Lao, the unfolding of the three major world religions—Daoism (east), Buddhism (west), and Yin-Yang practice (south)—and the development of the organization of the Celestial Masters. In terms of the latter, it emphasizes the replacement of the corrupt and despicable Six Heavens (the cosmology of the Confucian ritual system) with the pure and eminent Three Heavens of the Dao, made up of the three qi: original, beginning, and primordial. The three qi also gave rise to Lord Lao, who then created his own mother, the Jade Maiden of Mystery and Wonder (Xuanmiao yunü) from cosmic energies, then orchestrated his own birth and life. At the end of the latter, he moreover ordered Yin Xi to become the Buddha and thereby deliver the pure Dao to the western barbarians. The text provides an integrated worldview and represents as justification of Celestial Masters’ beliefs for the benefit of the Liu- Song court. The second juan deals more specifically with moral rules and theoretical doctrines, associated the Dao with nonaction and outlining details of zhai or purgations. It also presents a discussion of Daoism versus Buddhism in terms of greater and lesser vehicles, contrasting again the purity and eminence of the Dao with the more primitive and simple practices of Buddhists.",420,430,1581,1175,Livia Kohn,2022-06-21 21:40:50.851 +0200,2022-06-23 20:17:58.177 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1426,Early Missionary Christianity in China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Religious Group-Early Missionary Christianity in China

Speaking of Christianity in China, the early missionary period, compared with the later nineteenth century when both the Catholic and Protestant missionaries appeared, is usually defined as from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries. It was the time when the first most active Christian mission was developed in China. Then, during the European Reformation and overseas expansion, the Catholic missionary was the sole actor in evangelization financed both by the Church and states. The Society of Jesus was officially founded in 1540 and became a significant contributor to the China mission over the centuries. This religious order tied with Asia in the very beginning. Francis Xavier (1506-1552), the first generation of the Jesuits, embarked from Lisbon in 1541 under the auspice of the Portuguese court on behalf of the crown’s colony in India. Although Xavier only died on an island outside Macao, not yet set foot on Mainland China, the Padroado, the Portuguese royal supporting system of the Jesuit missionary, became the primary channel to initiate the Catholic missionary history in East Asia. The Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) was the most crucial figure in the inception of the Jesuit China mission, who arrived in Macao in 1582. Thenceforth until around 1724, when the Chinese Emperor officially prohibited the religion, this early missionary period of Christianity in China was well-known for its vigorous religious and cultural encounters and thought as the first and most fascinating cultural interaction between Europe and China. The Jesuit evangelization in Japan and China, starting with learning native languages and accommodating cultural elements to their preaching, was proposed by the Jesuit Visitor Alessandro Valignano (1539-1606). Ricci substantially realized this method of accommodation, to fully dress as a Chinese literatus and deeply engage in the Confucian/Mandarin atmosphere. Ricci’s most prominent and influential interpretation for the Chinese is to understand Christian God in the original Confucian classics, in which the supreme Shangdi 上帝or tian 天 (heaven) could be equivalently termed as Catholic Deus. Ricci’s return to the Chinese antiquity to conduct his religious adaptation to Chinese culture, standing in conflict with contemporary Neo-Confucianism, was an original way to invent an indigenous comprehension of Christianity. Ricci’s argument for early Chinese awareness of the Christian God was to appropriate ancient Chinese terms and imposed on it the Christian meaning of the highest Creator. Although the following controversy after Ricci’s death regarding this terminology abandoned them and preferably officiated the Tianzhu 天主, the Lord of Heaven, as the newly coined Chinese term for God, we have considered this “Confucian Christianity” as a highly original hybrid: a monotheist religion and a purist Confucian tradition. It is not merely a result of an ambitious cultural accommodation but also, from the perspective of religious history, one of the most significant characteristic products of the early missionary Christianity in China.
The second characteristic of this period could point to another outcome resulting from the intensive and interactive dialogues of the Jesuits and Chinese Mandarins. Tianxue 天學, learning of Heaven, appeared as a new discipline in the intellectual landscape of Late-Ming China. It indicates the Jesuit evangelization through European sciences and knowledge, which were also expected, in the missionary view, to meet Chinese intellectual interests and political needs. The above two characteristics demonstrate the importance of Jesuit accommodation, and also which raised one of the most well-known debates for Christian evangelization during this period, the Chinese Rites Controversy. One of the central controversial issues was the Jesuit interpretation of the Chinese worship of ancestors as the civil and social meanings without conflict with Christian monotheism. Deriving both from the criticisms of other Catholic religious orders, also working in East Asia on a comparatively smaller scale than the Jesuits, and from those doubts inside the Society itself, the Controversy lasted over one century. The Roman Church issued the final rejection of the Jesuit accommodation in 1742.",1580,1740,1583,1197,Hui-Hung Chen,2022-06-24 11:06:27.662 +0200,2022-07-22 11:47:54.357 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1427,The Chaldaean Oracles,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The “Chaldaean Oracles” comprise a body of fragments, survived through quotes and commentary by Neoplatonic writers, of a lost text from Graeco-Roman antiquity. The text is supposed to consist of utterances coming directly from the gods themselves, as well as from the soul of Plato. Originally composed in Greek language, the text uses the poetic form of dactylic hexameters, which was the traditional metre that was used both for divine oracles and for epic poetry. The authorship of the “Oracles” is a controversial issue. They are usually attributed to a father and son by the names of Julian the Chaldaean and Julian the Theurgist, who are believed to have lived during the reign of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161–180 CE), or perhaps that of Trajan (98–117 CE). The place of origin of the “Oracles” remains unknown. The fact that the text is written in Greek makes it likely that it originates from the eastern part of the Roman Empire. The term “Chaldean” attributed to the text goes back to antiquity: philosophers in the Platonic tradition venerated Chaldaea –a name that Greeks of the 4th century BCE and later used for Babylon– as a source of religious enlightenment. The region had a wider reputation in Graeco-Roman antiquity as the home of astrology and other esoteric doctrines and practices, while it is possible, by the time of the composition of the text, that the term “Chaldean” designated “magician” or “practitioner of mysterious arts”. The content of the “Chaldean Oracles” is abstruse, mystical and not necessarily self-consistent. It makes metaphysical claims about the structure of reality and refers to techniques of practical ritual magic. The “Oracles” embrace the basic Platonic division between a higher spiritual realm (Intelligible World) and an inferior material realm (Sublunar World). Presiding over the Cosmos is a divine trinity: Father, Mind and Power. Beneath these divinities are to be found a variety of lesser spiritual beings. The “Oracles” affirm that the divine realm is accessible to human beings. Through the use of meditation and magical ritual practices, the soul of the worshiper can ascend upwards from the world of matter to the world of spirit and can achieve communion with the divine. Neoplatonic philosophers, from Porphyry (c. 234–c. 305) to Damascius (480–c. 550), considered the “Oracles” as authoritative revelatory literature, equal in importance only to the “Timaeus” of Plato. Other ancient Neoplatonists who used the “Oracles” in their writings include Plotinus, the Emperor Julian, Syrianus, Hermias, Hierocles, Simplicius, and Olympiodorus. The Byzantine monk and scholar Michael Psellus (1018-1078) made the “Chaldean Oracles” a pillar of his philosophy. Ηe wrote commentaries on the “Oracles”, for the composition of which he drew from Proclus. Psellus’s commentaries profoundly shaped the way in which other Byzantine writers engaged with the “Oracles”, including Michael Italicus (d. before 1157), Nicephorus Gregoras (c. 1292–c. 1360), Gregory Palamas (c. 1296–1359) and George Gemistos Plethon (c. 1355–c. 1450). The “Chaldaean Oracles” entered Western European culture at the Renaissance and influenced Italian philosophers, such as Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. The first printed edition of the “Chaldean Oracles” went on sale in Paris, in 1538, published by Ludovicus Tiletanus (Jean Loys de Thielt), and it was based on the work of Plethon. The esoteric use of the Oracles began to gather steam in the late eighteenth century. It has been suggested that they might have influenced Mozart’s opera “The Magic Flute” (1791), while they formed part of the work of Thomas Taylor (1758–1835), the Platonic philosopher who was one of the first people in modern British history to embrace revived paganism as a philosophical and religious system.",100,199,1584,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-06-25 15:50:27.248 +0200,2022-06-28 10:59:29.476 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1428,Votive Deposits,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Buried votive offerings, or votive deposits, were a popular medium for communicating religious identities, aspirations, and social networks in medieval Japan. The 17th century saw the chance discovery of a series of subterranean caches containing mirrors, bronzes, and manuscripts on Mount Kinpusen in present-day Nara prefecture. These deposits also contained handwritten copies of Buddhist scriptures (sutras) preserved in bronzed cases, engraved with the names of famous courtiers and dated to 1007 CE. Archaeologists since have discovered several hundreds of similar deposits all over Japan, most dating from the late eleventh and twelfth centuries. In addition to the mound at Kinpusen, major examples include deposits at Mount Asama, Mount Kurama, Kumano, and Fushimi Inari. Almost half of all deposits have been found in Kyushu. Due to the fact that sutras are found in every deposit, scholars normally refer to these as kyōzuka, or sutra mounds. This scholarly category has its roots in historical gazetteers from Japan’s Edo period (1603-1867). During the primary duration of this practice in the twelfth century, the standard term for the practice of burying a sutra was nyohōkyō, meaning “to copy the sutras in accordance with the Buddha’s teachings."" This term primarily referred to a method for copying the Lotus Sutra, which was most frequently buried. Although Buddhist sutras  were a central component of these deposits, burials were performed in a variety of contexts, from temples and shrines to provincial settlements. The assemblages moreover resulted from various intentions, meanings, and social contexts. Votive deposits also tend to contain a diversity of materials beyond scriptures, including ceramics, mirrors, daggers, coal, projectile points, coins, and precious metals. Moreover, many sites have been found to contain inscriptions dating to different periods, suggesting that some deposits were reused at different points in time. Inscriptions in deposits, especially on sutra containers, have been the basis for interpretations of the motivations underlying this practice. The dawn of the practice happened alongside the beginning of mappō, “the end of the Dharma,” an age seeing the decline of the Buddha’s teachings. Other expressed motivations included veneration of local deities, protection of noble lineages, memorializing deceased relatives, establishing social connections through group burials, and articulating community affiliation. In their varying geographic, material, and social dimensions, medieval votive deposits were exceedingly diverse and contextually specific. They also represent an important body of archaeological materials for understanding religious and social life in medieval Japan.",1007,1220,1585,1196,Jonathan Thumas,2022-06-26 23:29:18.858 +0200,2022-09-29 03:33:19.259 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1429,Enheduana's Exaltation of Inana,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Exaltation of Inana is a hymnic and narrative poem attributed to Enheduana, the daughter of king Sargon of Akkad, who served as the high priestess of Nanna in the city of Ur. She appears as the narrator and protagonist of the poem, but because all manuscripts of the text date to five centuries after her lifetime, the attribution is uncertain. The poem details Enheduana's expulsion from the city of Ur following a revolt led by a man named Lugal-Ane. She prays to Nanna, the god she has served, but he does not answer; so she turns instead to Nanna's daughter Inana, the goddess of love, war, transformation, and paradox, aiming to recruit Inana to her cause and elevate her to the top of the Sumerian pantheon. Most of the poem is a passionate, metaphor-laden paean to the terrifying powers of Inana, culminating in a self-referential scene where Enheduana composes the text we have been reading in a night-time encounter with Inana - swaying and exalting the goddess, and thus saving herself.",-2300,1700,1586,1129,Sophus Helle,2022-06-27 17:08:19.760 +0200,2022-06-27 17:08:19.761 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Despite a range of archaeological features indicative of potential religious activities and thoughts, it remains ambiguous as to which part of Erlitou was dedicated to religion. Recent excavations reveal clear urban planning at Erlitou. The entire site (ca. 3 km2) had been divided into nine sections by two north-south roads and two east-west roads crossed with each other. Along the central north-south line, which becomes the one most important land marker in unban designing in later Chinese dynasties, lay the ritual/ceremonial section, palatial section and craft section. Therefore, as indicated by quite a few mounds and circular altars, the central north of Erlitou appears likely to be a centre for ritual/religious activities, involving worshiping or mass gathering. It is also worthy pointing out that other areas such as palatial section could also been involved with religion, where one can find some tombs with special burial practice. Given the massive scale of organization and many pioneering achievements at Erlitou, there is probably no doubt that the ritual system played a critical part, within which a number of elements could be related to religion. Unfortunately, no sign of writing has yet been recovered, making it very challenging to distinguish ritual with religion or perform finer-grained research on various aspects of religion at Erlitou.

1431,Elements of Theology,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Proclus’s “Elements of Theology” is the most systematic exposition of Neoplatonic metaphysics, an academic text in a systematic form that connects Greco-Roman antiquity with the Christian Middle Ages. This text, in fact, like most of the Neoplatonic writings, having influenced Christian theology mainly through the strange figure of pseudo-Denys the Aeropagite, appeared in its entirety at the beginning of the early humanist renaissance, both in Byzantium as well as in Italy, although, like other Neoplatonic texts, it survived in Arab philosophy through commentaries. Its author, Proclus of Lycia, or Proclus the Successor, was one of the most influential philosophical commentators of antiquity and is regarded as the greatest Neoplatonic philosopher of the fifth century CE. The title “Successor”  was given to the head of the School of Plato in Athens and signified that Proclus was the successor of his predecessor and also the latest successor of continuous Platonic scholarship going back to Plato, the founder of the Academy in Athens. In 430 or 431 CE, probably at the age of 19 or 20 years old, Proclus sailed from Alexandria to Athens. His teacher was Plutarch of Athens, who instructed Proclus on Aristotle's “De Anima” and Plato's Phaedo. After Plutarch’s death in 432 CE Proclus was under the guidance of Syrianus, the head of the Academy in Athens. He is also said to have been taught and initiated into Chaldaean wisdom by the fifth century Greek philosopher Asclepigenia, wife of Theagenes, and the daughter of Archiades and Plutarch of Athens. After Syrianus’s death, c. 437 CE Proclus became the head of the School of Plato in Athens. Proclus was a prolific writer of ancient Greek philosophy leaving behind extensive commentaries on Plato, Aristotle, Porphyry and Plotinus, books and treaties on Neoplatonic theology, epigrams and hymns. He set forth one of the most authentic and systematic expositions of Neoplatonism and his works represent the most complete statement of Platonism. Proclus stands at the end of ancient Greek philosophy and at the beginning of the philosophy of the Middle Ages. The importance of the “Elements of Theology”, and what highlights the dynamics of both its spread and influence, is not the fact that it is a mere summary form of late Greco-Roman Neoplatonism, but it is the unity of the systematic form with the transitional content, which concerns concepts that broadly establish the way of philosophical meaning-making and living that we follow to this day. The unity of the systematic form with the conceptual content is an essential parameter of this text. The concepts involved in this ground-breaking text are the result of its systematic form. It is innovative because of this unity, as the tendency of the Neoplatonism of late Greco-Roman philosophy to produce systematic forms finds here its supreme expression, which decisively influenced the entire Western philosophy. The text is divided into two main sections. The first (propositions 1 to 112) presents successively the general metaphysical “oppositions” used by Neoplatonism: the one and the many, cause and effect, immovable, self-moving, and passively mobile, the transcendence and persistence, decay and continuity, progress and return, the concepts of “causa sui” and “causatum”, eternity and time, substance and thought, the whole and the part, active and passive possibility, end and infinity, being, life, and knowledge. The second section (sentences 113 to 211) explains, in the light of the above “oppositions”, the relations formed in each of the three great categories of spiritual being: the Gods or entities, the minds and souls, and the relations connecting each of these categories with the lower ranks of being. As far as the influence of the text is concerned, an Arabic adaptation of it was made in the 9th century, called the “Kitāb al-Īḍāḥ fī al-khayr al-maḥḍ”, which was falsely attributed to Aristotle. This work was in turn translated into Latin in the 12th century by Gerhard of Cremona under the name “Liber de causis”, which became a standard part of the university curriculum in the 13th century. In Byzantium, the text was studied by Michael Psellos (11th century) and translated into Georgian by Psellos’s pupil Ioanne Petritsi, who also wrote a commentary on it. A christian refutation of the work was written by the bishop Nicolaus of Methone in the 12th century. William of Moerbeke's Latin translations of Proclus' works were not widely read in the Middle Ages, though in the 14th century a Latin commentary on the “Elements of Theology” was written by Berthold of Moosburg. Dante (c. 1265-1321) probably drew upon the “Liber de causis” for the Neoplatonic ideas in his “Divine Comedy”.",412,485,1633,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-06-29 16:44:09.269 +0200,2022-08-17 09:38:54.604 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1432,Preparation for the Gospel-Demonstration of the Gospel,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The “Praeparatio Evangelica” and the “Demonstratio Evangelica” of Eusebius of Caesarea are two parts of a single treatise that was apparently the most comprehensive apologetic and polemical work written in the early Christian era. The text attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over every pagan religion and philosophy, on the one hand. On the other, it focuses on Christianity's relationship to Judaism as the fulfillment of biblical prophecies. The “Praeparatio Evangelica” consists of fifteen books which have been completely preserved, while the “Demonstratio Evangelica” comprised twenty, of which only the first ten have survived.  Both works are addressed to the same audience, that is, new Christians of Gentile origin, and curious, educated pagans willing to learn about Christianity. Christian apologists had to fight against the claim that Christianity was a danger to the state, a crime against the official cult and religion and even against the Emperor himself. They fought for their legal and moral right to exist. Emphasizing the superiority of Christian morality and decency over the corrupt and degenerate social mores of the pagans, Christian apologists leveled against them the very same accusations which the pagans had used against Christianity. The apologists sought to weaken anti-Christian bias and to underline the superiority of Christianity over other religions and cults. Their attempt explains the often repeated claim that the Christian faith played a major role in maintaining world order, the status of the Emperor and the integrity of state and society. According to the apologists, a rational defense of the faith was necessary for the establishment of the right of the Christians to exist. Along with their effort to expose the absurdity and corruption of pagan religion, mythology and social norms, the apologists offered proof that only Christianity possessed a true understanding of God and of the universe. In this sense, the “Praeparatio Evangelica” is a quite interesting work, not so much because of its polemical content, but because of the abundance of its citations from the now lost works of ancient authors. Eusebius studded the “Praeparatio Evangelica” with many fragments from historians and philosophers, which are nowhere else preserved. The “Praeparatio Evangelica” preserves Pyrrho's translation of the Buddhist three marks of existence, upon which Pyrrho based Pyrrhonism; the text also provides a summary of the writings of the Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon, of which the accuracy has been shown by the mythological accounts found on the Ugaritic tables; the account of Diodorus Siculus on the wondrous voyage of Euhemerus to the island of Panchaea, where Euhemerus purports to have found the true history of the gods; it preserves fragments from the writings of the neoplatonic philosopher Atticus. There are no quotes from comedy, tragedy, or lyric poetry, but there are references to all the works of Plato and to an extensive range of later philosophic works, largely from Middle Platonists from Philo to the late 2nd century, as well as several more fragments from now lost works. The author of the text, Eusebius of Caesarea, c. 260/265–339, also known as Eusebius Pamphilus, was historian of Christianity, exegete, and Christian polemicist. He became the bishop of Caesarea Maritima, were he was born, in the Roman province of Syria Palaestina in around 314. He composed the texts in question between 313 and 324 CE, as apologetic works for the practice of verbal confrontation with Greeks and Jews. He conceived his apologetic work with a threefold purpose: To shatter the foundations of pagan religion and philosophy; To demonstrate that the Hebrew religion and philosophy are superior in every way to pagan culture; And to explain how Christianity diverges from Judaism and is thereby superior. The first part of the text, the “Praeparatio Evangelica” attempts to prove the superiority of Christianity by criticizing pagan religion and philosophy. The second part, the “Demonstratio Evangelica”, was intended to prove the validity of Christianity and the Gospel as the fulfillment of ancient prophecies. This could happen only after the reader of pagan origin had received suitable “preparation”, that is, the preparation for the presentation-demonstration of the Gospel. Hence, the “Praeparatio Evangelica” treats subjects familiar to the educated pagan, such as religion, mythology, philosophy, cosmology, theology, and ethics. At the “Demonstratio Evangelica” Eusebius proceeds to deal with particular problems that Christian belief presented to the educated pagan, such as the Son of God or the Logos, the incarnation, virgin birth, passion, crucifixion and resurrection.",312,324,1591,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-06-30 06:54:21.074 +0200,2022-08-02 17:40:32.006 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1433,Novatians,43,Religious Group (v6),"One of the oldest schisms in the Early Church is the Novatian schism. After the persecution of Decius (249-250) arose a disagreement within the Church of Rome about the way to accept the Christians who denied their Christian faith, because of the persecutions and the pressure to worship pagan idols. The result of this disagreement was the Novatian schism (251). Novatian (or Novatus) was a scholar (Stoic philosopher before his conversion to Christianity), who became a priest and a noted theologian and prolific writer. He was the first Roman theologian who used the Latin language. After the death of the Bishop of Rome Fabianus (236-250), who was killed in prison, the administration of the local Church was taken over by elders and deacons, with Novatian as their head. With the end of the persecutions of Decius the elders faced the question of the admission to the Church of those who had lapsed and wished to return to the Christian faith, as well as the issue of their penance. They thus adopted the so-called lifelong penance, meaning that the lapsed would be accepted to the Church on their deathbed. In March 251, with the emperor Decius’s death, the persecution began to subside and the Roman community seized the opportunity to nominate a successor to Fabian. Although Novatian was an eminent theologian in Rome and had a hand in running the Church after the death of Fabian, the moderate Roman aristocrat Cornelius (251-253) was elected. Cornelius adopted a more lenient attitude towards those who did not sacrifice to idols, but refused Christianity in a written declaration. The lapsed could be restored to communion after varying forms of repentance, demonstrated by a period of penance. Those who supported a more rigorous position, however, had Novatian consecrated as bishop and refused to recognize Cornelius as Bishop of Rome. In 251, Cornelius assembled a council of sixty bishops in Rome to acknowledge him as the rightful pope and excommunicated Novatian, as well as all of his followers, while the council settled also the question of the lapsed. While Novatian had refused redemption to the those who had renounced their Christianity under persecution but later wanted to return to the Church, his followers extended the doctrine to include all “mortal sins”, such as idolatry, murder, and adultery, or fornication. Many of them forbade second marriage as well. The repentance of these groups was lifelong in the broadest sense, that is, until the Second Coming, when the Lord Himself would judge them. Novatians considered the baptism of the clergy under the Bishop Cornelius invalid, so they and baptized those who joined their sect. Intolerant and authoritarian himself, Novatian forced his followers to swear that they would not follow Cornelius of Rome. Novatian died in 258, probably during Valerian’s persecutions. After his death, Novatianist churches continued to thrive side by side with the orthodox churches up to the fifth century in the West and up to the eighth century in the East, particularly in Asia Minor. In the West, Novatianist communities with their own bishops spread from Rome and Africa as far as Spain. Those who allied themselves with his doctrines were called Novatianists, but they called themselves “Catharoi” or “Purists” (not to be confused with the later Cathars) to reflect their desire not to be identified with what they regarded as the lax and tolerant practices of a corrupt ecclesiastical power. They always had a successor of Novatian at Rome. Some Novatians blended with the Montanists and, mostly in the East, many of the cities of Phrygia (former stronghold of the Montanists) had Novatianist bishops. The last of their communities survived till the end of the seventh century.",250,258,1588,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-06-30 09:22:55.930 +0200,2022-07-11 21:02:58.991 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1434,Kuna,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kuna, whose name for themselves is “Tule,” are an indigenous Central American group living along the northern coast of Panama. Originally from the Gulf of Urabá in present-day Colombia, the Kuna fled Spanish occupation in the 17th century and settled in what is now the Darién Province of Panama, eventually relocating to their current location on the San Blas Islands and northern coast. Through a combination of strategic alliances, negotiation, and rebellion, the Kuna have managed to maintain much of their cultural and political identity in the face of colonial pressure to assimilate. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence collected during fieldwork with the Kuna shortly after 1925, when La Revolución Tule (the Kuna Revolution), in response to assimilation pressure, won the Kuna semi-autonomous status for their land. During this time, traditional Kuna religion was still practiced, although syncretism with Christianity, and in particular Protestantism, was present. Living a righteous life, so as to avoid angering the supreme high god Pab Dummat, was of central importance in Kuna religion. The righteous were rewarded in the afterlife and wrongdoers were punished. Considerable political and religious overlap appears to have been present both in community leaders and in ceremonies. For example, large religious singing or chanting ceremonies took place in the same community meeting houses used for political purposes. Because religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1912,1937,1589,1090,Anj Droe,2022-06-30 17:46:12.290 +0200,2022-07-20 20:18:00.198 +0200,eHRAF
1435,Cathedral of Hagia Sophia,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church dedicated to the Holy Wisdom, or the Divine Wisdom (Hagia Sophia in Greek) was built by emperor Justinian I in the 6th century (532-537 CE), under the direction of the architects Anthemios of Tralles and Isidore of Militos. It was inaugurated on 27 December 537. The first church on the site was a basilica built in the 4th century by emperor Constantius II, inaugurated in 360. This building known also as the Great Church was burned down in 404 by the supporters of John Chrysostom, then Patriarch of Constantinople. The domed basilica built by emperor Theodosios II was completed in 415 and was destroyed in 532, again by fire, during the revolt of Nika. 
The domed basilica of Saint Sophia combines a longitudinal and centralised planning. The nearly square nave which measures 78 x 72 m (excluding the two narthexes) is covered by a huge dome of 31 m in diameter and two semidomes. The three aisles with galleries above are separated by two rows of columns made of finest marble. Likely, the lower parts of the walls are covered with marble slabs and opus sectile decoration, still well preserved. The building still standing is essentially the 6th-century construction apart from the dome which collapsed partially in 558 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt by Isidore the Younger and was dedicated on 24 December 562. The dome collapsed partially two more times and was rebuilt higher than the original one, while the whole construction was reinforced externally. In 1317 were added the huge exterior buttresses. The church underwent again restoration, following the collapse of the east arch in 1346, which brought down the east semidome and a part of the dome.
The church and its surrounding structures compose a complex that includes: to the west a colonnaded atrium with a fountain; to the north a baptistery; and, at the northeast corner a sacristy. The cathedral was the liturgical centre of Constantinople and as such, its south side was flanked to the patriarchal palace built between 565 and 577. A passage at its south-east corner was connecting Hagia Sophia to the Great imperial palace.
The 6th-century mosaic decoration of the church was largely non-figural as attested by the surviving fragments, such as those in the side aisles or the narthex’s vaulting. After the end of the Iconoclastic Controversy (8th-9th centuries) the church was redecorated. Part of the program is still preserved. In the apse an enthroned Virgin with Child; two archangels in the arch of the bema; Prophets and Fathers of the Church in the tympana (north and south walls) beneath the dome. In the gallery vaults it is known to have existed narrative scenes (Isaiah’s vision, Baptism of Christ, Pentecost). In the 10th century was added in the lunette of the southwest vestibule a depiction of Virgin enthroned with Christ, between Justinian I and Constantine holding respectively a model of the church and of the city of Constantinople. In the lunette above the “imperial door” (the central door between the inner narthex and the nave) was added around 900 a mosaic of Christ enthroned with an unnamed prostrate emperor. In the 11th and 12th centuries were added in the south gallery preserved for imperial use, mosaics depicting emperors and empresses. In the first, installed between 1028-1034, were depicted empress Zoe and her first husband, Romanos III, who was replaced between 1042 1055 by her third husband, Constantine IX Monomachos. Around 1118-1134 was added a mosaic depicting the Virgin with Child standing between emperor John II and empress Irini. In the late 13th century was installed in the south gallery the mosaic depicting the Deisis (Christ flanked by Virgin Mary and Saint John the Baptist).
In 1204 Hagia Sophia was looted by the Crusaders and the Venetians on the Fourth Crusade. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 the church was converted into a mosque, with the addition of minarets, a great chandelier, a mihrab and a minbar. In 1935 the monument was secularised and turned into a museum, while in 2020 it was converted back into a mosque.",360,1453,1590,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-07-03 09:15:03.829 +0200,2022-07-04 20:23:28.664 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1436,The Monastic School of Gaza,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Monastic School of Gaza was a monastic intellectual community flourished in the region of Gaza toward the end of the fourth century and in the first half of the fifth. It produced a wealth of literary works, such as monastic instructions, historical and hagiographic treatises, letters etc., and exhibited some of the most prominent figures of Eastern Christian monasticism. This monastic community is depicted as a “school” due to the fact that the central figures of Gazan monasticism displayed an intense interest in pedagogy, mainly in the ethical formation of the monks. The spiritual exercises, the moral progress and didactic methods reflect sustained at the monasteries reflect a pedagogic practice that bear close resemblance to training in the philosophical schools of Greco-Roman antiquity. 
There were several significant historical events in Egypt that led to the establishment and the intellectual blossoming of monasticism at Gaza, which soon became the stronghold of anti-Chalcedonian resistance in Palestine. More specifically, at the end of the fourth century, the Origenist controversy caused turbulence to Egyptian desert monasticism. Monks that were suspected as adherents of Origenistic views and beliefs were persecuted. Several of the monks that fled the area known as Scetis (the region of Wadi El Natrun, Arabic for “Natron Valley”, a valley located in Beheira Governorate, Egypt) found refuge in the Gaza area. In addition, during the first half of the fifth century, the invasion of the Mazices, tribes of Berbers of North Africa, reduced the numbers of the monks at the monastic center at Scetis. Many of these monks wandered beyond the Egyptian border and ended up in the Gaza area. Two are the claimants to the title of the founder of Palestinian monasticism: Chariton and Hilarion. Chariton, originating from Iconium in Asia Minor, came to the Judean Desert at the beginning of the fourth century and died in the laura at Faran, near Jerusalem, in the middle of the same century. According to St. Jerome, however, who traveled in the area at the end of the fourth century, it was Hilarion the one who introduced monasticism to Palestine. Hilarion was born around 291/2 in the village of Thabatha, south of Gaza, and died in Cyprus in 371. Another prominent figure of the Monastic School of Gaza was Abba Isaiah, an Egyptian monk who began his monastic life in a coenobium and later secluded himself in the desert. He drew many admirers, and in order to avoid them he decided to emigrate to Palestine. He finally withdrew to the Gaza region, in the second half of the fifth century, most probably near Beth Dallatha, in an effort to escape the hordes of admirers who congregated at his door seeking assistance and spiritual direction. Abba Isaiah introduced a significant shift in Gaza monasticism, revolutionizing its patterns of leadership and affecting every aspects of its life. In the years after the Council of Chalcedon (451) he established a coenobium that incorporated forms of lauritic monasticism and forged a pattern of spiritual leadership that continued in the first half of the sixth century among the monastic circle of Gaza under Barsanuphius and John. Abba Isaiah became one of the leaders of the anti-Chalcedonian opposition in Palestine. He died in his monastery in 491. During the same time, Peter the Iberian, an Iberian prince and former political hostage at the royal court of Constantinople, founded his monastery at Bethlehem (430). Consecrated as bishop of Maiuma in 452, he escaped to Egypt due to a decree of a local ruler that banished all the anti-Chalcedonian bishops. In the early 470s, Peter moved to Palestine where he continued ascetic activities, acquiring great fame as a holy Father. The appointment of Peter’s disciple, Severus, as Patriarch of Antioch, marked the end of the anti-Chalcedonian monastic center of Gaza. Until that time, a fairly extensive network of anti-Chalcedonian monasteries existed in the area, extending northward toward Caesarea from the region to the south and east of Gaza, including the enclave of the Eleutheropolis area, which apparently constituted the geographic base for the anti-Chalcedonian resistance in Palestine. Anti-Chalcedonian monasteries also existed in Maiuma, Caphar She'artha, Migdal Thabatha, Kanopis, Beth Dallatha, Gerar and Peleia near Ascalon. But the rise of the Chalcedonian emperor Justin (518) and his nephew Justinian and the changing politico-ecclesiastical climate led to the expulsion of anti-Chalcedonian bishops and monks from the region. Hence, the stage of the next generation of Gaza monasticism became Thabatha. There, at the first half of the sixth century, Barsanuphius and John, their disciple Dorotheus of Gaza and Abba Seridus, had their monastery. This community accepted the Council of Chalcedon, at least externally, and apparently preferred to withdraw into monastic piety. With the Islamic conquest, the historical sources fell silent and the monastic community of Gaza sank into oblivion.",320,536,1593,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-07-04 15:12:54.322 +0200,2022-07-12 08:38:01.008 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1437,Temple of Ḫaldi (Ayanis),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Temple of Ḫaldi located in Ayanis is one of the best examples of an Urartian susi temple. It is also the most comprehensively excavated and published Urartian religious building. It was built during the reign of Rusa son of Argišti, the last Urartian ruler who left a tangible mark both in the archaeological record and in the textual one. The temple complex measures 30 x 30 m, divided by the rest of the settlement by mudbrick walls. Inside the open courtyard, the susi temple measures 13 x 13 m and abuts the eastern courtyard wall. In front of the temple, four monumental pillars supported a portico around the northern, western and southern walls. Outside the courtyard, additional building connected to the temple complex have been excavated on the northern and eastern sides. The temple itself has a standard rectangular structure, with buttressed corners. The lower structure of the temple was made of andesite blocks, placed directly onto bedrock, and supporting mudbrick walls of a considerable, albeit unknown, height. Inside the cella, the floor was covered with alabaster slabs, and the andesite blocks were carved and inlayed with a softer stone. The motifs included winged figures and animals, rosettes, plants, and geometrical designs. A long monumental inscription, divided into eight sections is carved either side of the entrance to the temple, and on the two walls of the short corridor leading to the cella.
Although probably in use for less then half a century, the Ayanis temple is the final stage in the evolution of Urartian cultic buildings. There is little variation in susi temples once set in this form by Minua at the end of the 9th century BCE. However, with Rusa son of Argišti we see decorative elements previously unknown, and we find the temple at a centre of a complex on which we have little information from other sites.",-680,-650,1594,1011,Dan Socaciu,2022-07-05 10:41:01.522 +0200,2022-09-26 16:32:09.758 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Its initial phase of construction is dated in the end of 12th -beginning of the 13th century. An extensive use of various brick ornaments stand out in its exterior:  ""cloisonné masonry"", checkerboard and rosette patterns, dentil courses and eaves, relief slabs. The interior surfaces are covered by at least two phases of painted decoration; probably one byzantine, very damaged, and one that is today more visible, of post-byzantine time, dated in the 16th-17th century. The church is decorated also by relief decoration in marble, set in pieces or as ensembles such as the arched screen (templon) and the capitals of columns.

1440,Basilica of Saint Demetrios,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The cross-transept basilica dedicated to saint Demetrios the Myroblyte (the myrrh-gusher), located in the centre of the city of Thessaloniki (Northern Greece), was considered a major pilgrimage. It is believed that it was built by the Roman governor named Leontios in the third quarter of the 5th century CE, following the transfer of the cult of Saint Demetrios from Sirmium (present day city of Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) to Thessaloniki. The first church on the site was constructed in the early 4th century on a complex of Roman buildings, including a bath that was incorporated in the crypt, under the sanctuary. This was the place where, according to tradition, the saint was imprisoned and martyred. The crypt became since the early Christian period the main place of worship of the martyr, and was related to the belief that myrrh flowed from his wounds. Pilgrims were therefore entering the small semi circular room with the ciborium in the middle, for receiving the miraculous myrrh. The 5th-century church was burnt between 629 and 634 but was restored immediately thereafter, under the care of the bishop of Thessaloniki and Leo the eparch, as mentioned by the mosaic inscription that accompanies the depiction of the saint and the two individuals. The 7th-century church retained the precedent form of the basilica, reincorporating large parts of it as well. Fire destroyed again the monument in 1917, which was rebuilt with original materials and fragments. The basilica has five aisles separated by four rows of columns with two pairs of large piers interposed amongst the columns of the central aisle. The church also includes a three-aisled transept at the east, galleries, and low clerestory windows. Each wing of the transept is separated into three parts by a Π-shaped colonnade. The cenotaph of saint Demetrios was placed in the chapel incorporated into the north-west end of the north aisles. To the southeast corner of the basilica was added a small three-aisled chapel dedicated to saint Euthymios. It was frescoed in 1303, at the behest of protostrator Michael Glavas Tarchaneiotis and his wife Maria Palaiologina. The program of the chapel is typical of the period, with scenes from the Dodekaorton, the miracles and teaching of Christ, and episodes from the life of saint Euthymios. Apart from the sculptural decoration of the capitals, the cornices, the impost blocks of the pilasters, the intrados of the tribelon and the wings in a variety of forms and styles, parts of the original marble revetment and the panels of opus sectile are still preserved on the walls. The basilica also contains the marble funerary monument of a wealthy merchant and notable of the city of Thessaloniki, Loukas Spantounis, buried there just after 1481. The mosaic decoration of the basilica was not destroyed completely by the fire of 1917. Fragments are still preserved on the two large piers at the east of the sanctuary and the west wall of the nave. The mosaic panels were not created as a part of an iconographic program, but were commissioned independently; some of them dating from before the 7th century fire, some date from the period of reconstruction that followed the fire, while the latest ones are 11th-century creations. They depict saint Demetrios orans with donors and in other cases they commemorate the saint’s actions and miracles. The 9th-century mosaic panel depicts the Virgin and a military Saint in an attitude of supplication with Christ blessing from the heavens. Two more fragments of mosaics were detached and are currently displayed at the White Tower of Thessaloniki. The basilica was also decorated with frescoes destroyed during the fire of 1917. The ones that have survived depict scenes from the life of saint Demetrios. On the south wall survives a scene depicting a mounted emperor (identified as either Justinian II or Basil II) entering the city. On the second pier of the colonnade, south of the central aisle was represented in the 11th century venerable (Osios in Greek) Loukas Steiriotis, a 10th-century saint. On the first pier of the same colonnade was depicted between 1360-1380 saint Ioasaph with a church father. A Deisis (Christ flanked by Virgin Mary and Saint John the Baptist) and Christ enthroned painted in the 14th century were uncovered after the restoration of the monument, following the fire of 1917.",300,1917,1597,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-07-09 15:11:34.647 +0200,2022-07-10 08:32:22.939 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The Mexicas built and developed a highly complex system of values, symbols, and rituals that ruled daily life of commoners. The religion was also deeply intertwined with the tlahtoani (Mexica ruler) legitimation and Mexica territorial expansion. Mexica religion was in many ways an heir of a very long Mesoamerican religious tradition.

1442,On the Body and Blood of the Lord (De corpore et sanguine Domini) - Paschasius Radbertus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"One of the earliest complete treatises on the Eucharist, Paschasius Radbertus' De corpore contained twenty-two chapters, each answering a specific question related to the Eucharist, and included references and excerpts from the works of the early church fathers and to scripture. Radbertus (c.785-c.865) was a Carolingian theologian and Benedictine monk at the abbey of Corbie in northern France. Around 833, Radbertus first wrote the De corpore and dedicated it to Warin, his former pupil and fellow monk at Corbie, who had traveled to the newly established abbey of Corvey in Saxony and become its abbot. According to Radbertus’ prologue, Warin requested a short work on the Eucharist for his new community on the edge of Christendom. In late 843, shortly after Radbertus became abbot of Corbie, he revised and rededicated the De corpore to Charles the Bald, King of the Franks. This second edition included several miracle stories surrounding the Eucharist that did not appear in the first version, as well as a new dedicatory prologue to the king.

Throughout the De corpore, Radbertus argued that the Eucharistic bread and wine were the literal body and blood of Christ and not merely symbols of it. Radbertus opened the entire text with a chapter explicitly about this issue. The De corpore also addresses specific aspects of the celebration of the Mass, including the use of ritual objects, and Old Testament precedents for Christ’s suffering.",830,835,1598,1154,Sarah Luginbill,2022-07-09 21:42:28.099 +0200,2022-11-08 23:47:22.857 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Around 1062, Lanfranc of Canterbury (1005/10-1089), prior of the Benedictine abbey of Bec, responded to Berengar with the De corpore et sanguine Domini, which reaffirmed Paschasius Radbertus’ declaration that the consecrated bread and wine were truly the body and blood of Christ. Lanfranc’s assertion rested on three main points: 1) transformation of the bread and wine into Christ at the moment of consecration relied on the miraculous power of the priest, 2) even though the bread and wine transform, they maintain their earthly properties and appearance, and 3) the body of the Eucharist is identical to the body of the Virgin Mary’s son, Jesus Christ.",1062,1063,1599,1154,Sarah Luginbill,2022-07-09 23:07:53.948 +0200,2022-11-08 23:47:36.057 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The Workmen's Village lies on the eastern outskirts of the ancient city. It is possible that at least some of the workers who lived here had relocated from the tomb workers' settlement of Deir el-Medina at ancient Thebes (modern Luxor).",-1352,-1327,1604,885,Anna Stevens,2022-07-10 15:56:20.632 +0200,2022-07-13 15:01:45.628 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1448,Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church dedicated to the Holy Wisdom, or the Divine Wisdom (Hagia Sophia in Greek), is located to the south-eastern part of the city of Thessaloniki (Northern Greece). It has served as the Metropolitan church of Thessaloniki and during the Latin occupation of the city (1204-1224), it became the Latin cathedral.
The present building was built at the end of the 7th century, over the remains of a much larger five-aisled basilica dedicated to saint Mark, destroyed by the big earthquake of 620. Hagia Sophia is almost square in plan with a tripartite sanctuary projecting from its eastern end. It belongs to the type of transitional cross-in-square church, an evolution of the basilica with a dome. The nave measuring around 31 x 29 m (excluding the apse) is covered by a large cubic dome pierced by 12 arched windows, projecting above the timber roof. The dome which collapsed during the earthquakes of 813-820 and was replaced, is supported by four barrel vaults departing from four large piers at the corners of the central space. Each pier is divided into sections by arches that are wider on the ground level, while above are smaller and double. The church possesses lateral aisles divided from the central nave by colonnades alternating columns and narrow piers, a narthex and galleries above them, with the west gallery being a 10th century addition. The lead seals carrying names of bishops and other ecclesiastics discovered in the southwest corner of the west gallery suggest that this space may well have been used by the Church administration. Gregory Palamas, Archbishop of Thessaloniki (1347-1359) and the leading figure of the hesychastic movement, was buried in Hagia Sophia. In 1430, following the capture of Thessaloniki by the Ottomans, the church was converted into a mosque. What remains from that period is the tower on the north-western corner of the church, probably the basis of a minaret. Following the city’s liberation in 1912 it was again converted into a church. The monument was destroyed by fire in 1890. It was restored between 1907 and 1909 by a team led by Charles Diehl and was inaugurated on 29 June 1913. Following the earthquakes of 1978, Hagia Sophia was restored again, and excavations were undertaken inside the monument and in its adjacent courtyard.
The mosaic decoration of Hagia Sophia belongs to different phases. The original mosaics in the sanctuary are dated between 780 and 797, based on the presence of a colossal cross and the monograms of emperor Constantine VI and Irene. In the dome is depicted the Ascension of Christ. Below Christ, seated in a rainbow, stands the Virgin flanked by two angels. Around them are assembled the twelve Apostles. The information provided by the inscription that accompanies the scene, indicating that it was added under the Archbishop of Thessaloniki Paul, permitted to identify him as the friend of Patriarch Photios of Constantinople and thus to estimate the mosaic’s creation to the 88o’s. In the semi-dome of the apse was installed the Virgin enthroned holding Christ, either contemporary with the mosaic of the dome; or, an 11th-century addition. The composition replaced an iconoclastic cross. The walls of the church were covered with marble slabs. The marble columns and their capitals with the acanthus leaves come from an earlier building. In the 11th century Hagia Sophia was decorated with frescoes, still surviving at the windows of the narthex. Their creation is contemporary to the addition of the narthex, after 1037. The church contained also a four-columned sepulchral monument embedded within the south-eastern pier cluster decorated with frescoes by two different painters. It was dated after the first quarter of the 13th century, immediately after the liberation of the city from the Latins in 1224. The parts of the tomb that have survived, fragments of the monument’s frescoes, of its mosaic decoration, as well as the marble slabs of the church are exhibited at the Museum of Byzantine Culture of Thessaloniki; while its marble ambo transferred to Istanbul in 1905, is currently displayed at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.",650,1913,1605,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-07-11 14:41:15.439 +0200,2022-07-18 21:55:44.644 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1449,Aztec-Mexica Temple R of Tlatelolco,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This temple was erected by the Mexica (Aztecs) living in Tlatelolco as one of the temples in their ceremonial-ritual complex. The Temple R was dedicated to their wind deity, Ehécatl-Quetzalcoatl. This deity was linked to the main Mexica god Tlaloc, in charge of rain and earth's fertility. As such, ceremonies associated with fertility, rain, and the successful maintenance of agricultural cycles were carried out at this temple. In the 1980s, a team of INAH specialists encountered the remains of several individuals during their excavations at this temple. The individuals, including infants, children and adults, had been sacrificed and placed in particular burial contexts: on the ground and inside pots with several artifacts and ecofacts. This sacrificial event has been linked to a one-time ritual ceremony during the massive drought of 1454-1457 CE (also known as the ""famine of 1 Rabbit"" based on the Mexica calendar; during the reign of Motecuhzoma I).",1337,1521,1606,1106,Diana Moreiras,2022-07-11 23:28:07.630 +0200,2022-11-08 19:23:50.751 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence collected during fieldwork with the Tehuelche from 1869-1870, at which time various types of contact between the Tehuelche and the Spanish, including missions and trade relations, had existed for over 300 years (Adem, 2009:1). In 1870, despite centuries of contact with the Spanish, the Tehuelche had maintained their traditional religious beliefs and practices. The Tehuelche believed in both a high god, who had little to do with human affairs, and troublemaking supernatural beings that are also referred to as devils. Religious specialists, who had powers that gave them the ability to treat illnesses, predict the future, and prevent harassment by the devils, played an important role in everyday life. For the Tehuelche, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life.

1451,Religion in the Early Bronze Age / Canaan,43,Religious Group (v6),"Given the absence of written sources, evidence of cult and religion in Canaan / southern Levant during the Early Bronze Age (3600–2400 BCE) relies exclusively on the material remains that people inhabiting this region have left behind. These material remains are limited and the interpretation of their meaning often remains uncertain. Religious architecture represents the main evidence for the period, with the classic type of the broad-room temple, placed in a courtyard at times equipped with a stone altar for sacrifices. In addition, a few cult objects (cultic vessels, shrine models, figurines) and some iconographic sources, i.e. cylindrical seals decorated with cult scenes, shed light on some cultic practices and rituals. The cylinder seals impressions, in particular, seem to indicate the practice of a fertility cult, linked to a fertility goddess who represented the main deity. Early Bronze Age temples may have been dedicated to this fertility goddess. On the other hand, the presence of twin temples – as in the sacred area of Arad – could indicate the worship of a divine couple (possibly depicted also on some EB III cylinder seal impressions), with a male deity worshipped as a partner of the fertility goddess. The increasing images of bulls documented in the Early Bronze Age may be associated with this male deity (a prototype of El, Baal or Dagan in the second millennium BCE).
The temples were also to be the center of cultic events and public rituals involving the members of the community.",-3600,-2400,1609,1184,Maura Sala,2022-07-15 17:04:42.675 +0200,2022-08-31 19:18:24.847 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1452,Soushen ji 搜神記,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Soushen ji 搜神記 (“Annotations on searching for spirits”) is canonically considered to be the first example of the zhiguai xiaoshuo 志怪小說 literary strand, which comprises novels or stories about extraordinary events, characterized by the presence of spirits, ghosts, and supernatural phenomena. The Soushen ji has been compiled during the first half of the IV century (more precisely, around the year 350) by Gan Bao 干寶, writer and historiographer at the Jin 晉 court (265-420) during the reign of Emperor Yuan 元. 
Since the Soushen ji is the first real anthology of passages on supernatural events that has come down to us, the first written records of numerous well-known Chinese legends, as well as the first descriptions of real and mythological characters that inspired later texts, can be traced to it. It not only influenced the later evolution of the zhiguai genre, but it also laid the foundation for the development of the later chuanqi 傳奇 (reports on extraordinary events) that developed during the Tang 唐 dynasty (618 – 907).
As with most texts from ancient China, we do not possess the original edition of the text, but the work of later editors, and it is therefore impossible to determine precisely how the original text was structured. Regarding the contemporary audience's perception of the anomalous themes dealt with in the Soushen ji, not much is known, yet the affiliation to the zhiguai genre is undoubted, based on some peculiar characteristics of the text:
-	the title reflects the classic structure that usually characterizes anthologies on the subject: a verb indicating the research or narrative (sou 搜), followed by a noun explicating the supernatural, spiritual or anomalous content (shen 神), and, at the end, a character indicating the collection of documents itself (ji 記), since it consists of numerous independent pieces and not of a continuous and organic narrative;
-	the prose is classical but lightened by the insertion of non-essential grammatical particles that make it reminiscent of the spoken language, yet never trespassing into the vernacular; 
-	the narrative is focused on extraordinary events, juxtaposed against a context of everydayness and normality.
Regarding the dating of the work, the almost complete absence of references to Buddhism suggests that the collected stories are dated between the 2nd and 3rd centuries. 
Moreover, none of the dates or events mentioned are later than the year 323, so it can be assumed that all the events narrated are prior to that year. Yet, some interpolations on the text and the specification, through the insertion of the character Jin 晉, of the affiliation of the various emperors and eras to that dynasty (unnecessary for a reader belonging to the same historical period) prove its redaction by a later editor. Some references to the Soushen ji found in immediately later works confirm a dating around the year 350. These texts are: the Shui jing zhu 水 經 主 (""Commentary on the Water Classics""), the Soushen hou ji 搜 神 後 記 (""Subsequent Annotations on searching for spirits"") by Tao Qian 陶 潛 and the Hou Han shu 後 漢 書 (""Book of the Posterior Han"") by Fan Ye 范 曄 , whose thirteenth and fourteenth chapters find almost complete correspondence in the sixth chapter of the Soushen ji.
The intent behind the writing of the Soushen ji, clarified by Gan Bao himself in the preface to the work, goes far beyond entertainment and is historical-didactic, stimulated by the author's strong interest in proving the great power of supernatural forces in a rational and coherent way.
Thanks to the author's biography in the Jin shu 晉 書 (""Book of the Jin""), we know the peculiar circumstances under which Gan Bao is said to have decided to start gathering the material for the drafting of the Soushen ji: some extraordinary events seem to have affected his family, namely at the death of his father and at the time of his brother's illness. Although the historicity of such events has not been proven, nor it is certain that such stories associated with Gan Bao's biography actually involved his family (and have not even been elaborated on after the author's death and associated with his name only later by historiographers), such facts are traditionally considered to be the prerequisite for the realization of the work.
The structure of the work is very simple, the excerpts are collected into chapters based on a thematic rather than chronological choice, and the literary finesse is less accurate when compared to later works pertaining to the same genre (e.g.: the Liaozhai zhiyi 聊 齋 志 異 written by Pu Songling 蒲松龄 in 1740). Moreover, unlike other later zhiguai or chuanqi works, it is not declared to be literary fiction: it is defined as a chronicle of extraordinary events, mostly gathered from older sources, and, to a lesser extent, also from contemporary events.
The bibliographical sources from which the author certainly drew are at least thirty-three and among the various titles, one can mention the Zuozhuan 左 傳, the Guoyu 國 語, the Han shu 漢書, and, above all, the Yijing 易經.
In the preface to the text, Gan Bao states that none of the facts narrated were invented by him. The repetition of some anecdotes, which unequivocally represent different versions of the same event or references to the same folkloric tradition, supports the author's assertion. Again in the preface, Gan Bao justifies the possible presence of errors or imprecisions due to eventual inaccuracies in the sources: this is a typical problem of historical and historiographical work in relation to the accuracy and truthfulness of the testimonies. This emphasizes Gan Bao's goal of discussing the supernatural through the tools of chronicle and historiography, to prove the veracity of such events to the skeptical contemporary public.
Based on Gan Bao’s biography in the Jin shu 晉書, Gan Bao wrote a text in 30 chapters entitled Soushen ji, while the received text consists of 20 chapters. Scholars agree that the original work was lost in the early years of the Song 宋 dynasty (960 - 1279) and that the version consisting of 464 passages, divided into twenty chapters, is actually an accurate Ming-era reproduction, based on collections of passages from the periods of the Six Dynasties, the Tang, and Song Dynasties. It was Hu Yinglin 胡 應 麟 (a Ming scholar, historian, poet, literary theorist, and owner of one of the most well-stocked libraries of the time) who recompiled the text based on various sources accessible to him. The oldest account of the Soushen ji in 20 chapters is part of the collection Bice Huihan 秘册彙涵 (""Collection of Secret Volumes""), compiled by Hu Zhenheng 胡 震亨 and engraved on wood in 1603. The reduction in the number of chapters from 30 to 20 is presumed to be due to the gradual loss of passages during the various recompilations of the text.
None of the passages included in the collection are particularly long, the shortest being less than ten characters, while the longest does not exceed five hundred characters. The language used is the classical language (as for all tales of anomalies from the Chinese Middle Ages): although some of the material included was evidently taken from oral sources, in fact, the text was written to be read in the same way as historical texts. 
Some of the many themes that emerge in Soushen ji: hagiographic accounts of the lives and deeds of immortal beings; good and bad omens associated with pre-Han cosmology based on the interaction between yin and yang and the Wuxing 五行 (five phases); dozens of different types of spirits and demons; unusual and miraculous births; encounters with the death and resurrections; medical and magical prescriptions; accounts on metamorphoses, demonic possessions and exorcisms; strange animals with unusual powers.",100,350,103,1195,Francesca Puglia,2022-07-15 20:34:20.679 +0200,2022-07-28 12:52:50.417 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1453,Monastery of saint Neophytos the Recluse,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Saint Neophytos was born in 1134 in Cyprus. He was tonsured at the Monastery of saint Chrysostom Koutsoventis (Cyprus). Following a great deal of wanderings, in 1159 he found a cave in the mountains of Paphos (near the present-day village of Tala) where he was settled and lived until the end of his life (ca. 1214) as a recluse. By 1160 Neophytos widened the original cave (the Enkleistra) and removed the insecure parts, he set up an altar, dedicated to the Holy Cross, and excavated a tomb, in which he was buried after his death. By 1170 Neophytos was a well-known hermit, so at the instigation of the bishop of Paphos Basil Kinnamos, he accepted priesthood and founded a monastery, for which he composed a set of rules (“Typiki Diathiki”) for its administration. Following this decision, the cave was extended for the creation of cells and the refectory. In 1183 was created the naos. As indicated by the inscription in the cell written by the well-known painter Theodoros Apseudis, another part of the cell and the tomb chamber were decorated under the patronage of Basil Kinnamos, between 1182 and 1183. The frescoes covered the original, simple, white ground fresco decoration. Apart from the scene of the Annunciation, the rest of the Christological scenes from this phase of decoration, belong to the Passion cycle. The rest of the walls are covered with representations of monastic saints holding scrolls, on which are written didactic passages. The fact that saint Neophytos was depicted twice in the program could indicate that he was the person who determined it, instead of the patron, Basil Kinnamos. By the end of 1197 was completed the so-called “New Zion”, a cave above the initial cell of the Enkleistra, dug and named thus by Neophytos, who was constantly longing for solitude. After Neophytos moved to the upper cell, the iconostasis was inserted, and the naos was decorated with more monastic saints by another painter. Around 1200 the refectory was decorated by a different painter. After the saint’s death, the monastic community continued to exist. Around 1500 the narthex was remodelled and decorated, and the refectory was partially repainted. In 1503 the paintings in the naos and the bema have been partially restored. 
In the early 16th century, in the vicinity of the Enkleistra was built the new katholikon (main church) of the monastery, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It is a three-aisled basilica ending in a large apse to the east. The lateral aisles are divided from the central nave by colonnades. The nave and the aisles are barrel-vaulted. The nave vault is interrupted before the sanctuary by a dome on high drum. The doorway on the west wall, as well as the plain lancet windows follow Gothic models. The church was entirely decorated with frescoes, a large part of which was destroyed. In the middle of the eighteenth century, the relics of Neophytos were translated to the church, where they are housed until today. Around the Enkleistra and the katholikon of the Monastery were erected in different periods auxiliary buildings including cells for the monks, the refectory, a library, a museum etc.",1159,1503,1610,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-07-16 15:06:52.378 +0200,2022-07-17 15:23:59.074 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1454,Hesychastic Controversy,43,Religious Group (v6),"The hesychast controversy which lasted for some two decades started as a theological dispute but evolved into a political matter, relating to the strife between the contenders of the Byzantine throne. Hesychasm was a method of monastic prayer and contemplation practiced in quietude, in “hesychia” in Greek, and thus the name hesychasm. The term designates the process of retiring inward by ceasing to register the senses, in order to achieve an experiential knowledge of God. The term “Hesychasm” was originally used in the 4th century to denote any kind of hermit or anchorite monk. Evagrius Ponticus or Evagrius the Solitary (345-399 AD), a disciple of Basil of Caesarea, was the first to systematize the various contemplative practices into a unified system of prayer. He explained what the act of praying is, and what its effect is on the individual. The goal of monasticism was not to proclaim the Kingdom of God through a particular kind of material existence but to attain the total disembodiment of the mind through prayer. Proper activity of the mind is to detach itself from the body so it can be united to God. Ps. Macarius (a conventional designation of the anonymous author of works falsely attributed to Macarius of Egypt, 300-391 AD) made Evagrius’s ideas more compatible with Orthodox teaching. He shifted the focus of contemplative prayer away from the mind and its detachment from the body and located the Incarnation as the focal point for contemplative prayer. According to Ps. Macarius, the presence of the incarnated God meant that God had become accessible through physical reality. By attaining what Ps. Macarius called “purity of heart,” one can enter into the eschatological reality of Christ’s presence in our mind, body, and spirit. This mystical method was centered around unceasing prayer that opened the monk to the way Christ was present in him. The monastic practices in question became a crucial subject of debate following the reaction towards the teachings of Barlaam of Calabria, or Barlaam of Seminara, who attacked them. Barlaam (1290-1348) was an Orthodox monk on Mount Athos. He was educated in the West, and he was a supporter of humanistic renaissance thinking. He was a faithful proponent of Orthodoxy. In the early 1330s, Barlaam met the monks of Mount Athos and doubted about their hesychastic method of prayer. The monks he met were poorly educated-if not completely illiterate and therefore unable to answer his questions about their practices. After this encounter, Barlaam insistent that their use of the human body in prayer and their direct experience of God was misguided and heretical. He wrote treatises condemning their practices, mocking the bodily positions involved during Hesychastic prayer. 
He rejected their claim to bodily awareness of the divine presence and their visions of the un-created light. He was concerned that these visions, if they were occurring, were not affecting the monks in ways he thought they should. The reaction to Barlaam’s opinions was headed mainly by the monk – and later bishop of Thessaloniki – Gregory Palamas (1296-1357/9), who became the main representative of hesychasm and the leader of the hesychast party. In 1341 Andronikos III Palaiologos summoned a Council which didn’t reach a conclusion. Following the emperor’s death, a civil war broke out between John Kantakouzinos and the supporters of the underage heir John V, concerning his succession. Kantakouzenos supported Palamas but so did his opponents, Alexios Apokaukos and Anna of Savoy. The aristocrats supported Palamas largely due to their conservative and anti-Western tendencies as well as their links to the Orthodox monasteries. It was not until the triumph of Kantakouzenos in taking Constantinople in 1347 that the Palamists were able to achieve a lasting victory over the anti-Palamists. The Council of 1351, summoned by the usurper John VI Kantakouzinos (reg. 1347–1354), recognised hesychasm as an official doctrine of the Orthodox Church, remaining thus until today.",1337,1351,1612,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-07-18 08:23:39.200 +0200,2022-07-27 19:00:52.804 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1455,Basseri,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Basseri are a society of nomadic pastoralists in the Fars Province of Iran who distinguish themselves from their diverse neighbors through primarily political allegiance (as opposed to distinct cultural features or language) (Adem, 2009:1). This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence collected during fieldwork with the Basseri in 1958, during which time the political leader of the Basseri was still recognized by the Iranian government and the Basseri were largely autonomous. However, immediately after this time period, the Basseri chief was dismissed from power, with the Iranian Army assuming power over the Basseri instead. The Basseri identify themselves as Shia Muslims. However, during the time focus of this entry, religion and religious practices were not a very significant part of everyday life. Prayer was irregular, and observance of annual Islamic festivals was minimal. Most ceremonies, even if invoking some religious elements, were oriented more toward major life events rather than religion.

1456,Religion in the Middle Bronze Age / Canaan,43,Religious Group (v6),"Evidence of religion and ritual in Canaan / southern Levant during the Middle Bronze Age comes from sacred architecture and ritual spaces, cultic paraphernalia, as well as from a variety of iconographic representations (votives in the form of metal and clay figurines, glyptic). Written sources are scarce: local and contemporary religious texts are lacking. However, some information relating to the Canaanite cult comes from contemporary textual material from neighboring regions (e.g., the texts from Mari or the Egyptian Execration texts dating to the Twelfth Dynasty). Ritual and mythological texts from Ugarit are also often used in the reconstruction of the Canaanite religion, but they are from north Syria and date to the Late Bronze Age.
Overall, Canaanite religion does not express a homogeneous tradition; it was rather expressed in heterogeneous terms in the different cultic contexts, reflecting the diversity of the various micro-regions in the southern Levant. The evidence points to a polytheistic religion. Deities of various kinds and names were worshiped in local sanctuaries. Such deities were organized in a pantheon and associated with particular places, e.g. as patron gods of the Canaanite cities. Nevertheless, the precise identification of Canaanite gods and goddesses venerated in the different sanctuaries remains difficult, as depictions of deities are limited and are found mainly in the form of votives (e.g., small metal and clay figurines). Likewise, the reconstruction of the pantheon(s) and the relationships between the deities vary from place to place.
Sanctuaries were ultimately spaces within which social cohesion and group unity were shaped, through both the worship of the deities and ritual acts, mainly centered on propitiation of divinity and healing. We register both roofed temples and open-air cult areas. Most of the evidence comes from the city temples, linked to the officially sponsored religion: the latter belong to the type of the monumental symmetrical long-room temple, the so-called migdal temple with origins in Syria, including the temples of Hazor (Areas A and H), Megiddo, Shechem, Pella and Tel Haror. In addition to the central temples, rural temples and minor shrines have been unearthed at the sites of Tell el-Hayyat, Tel Kitan, Givat Sharett and Nahal Rephaim; while a small extramural cult site has been excavated at Nahariyah. Temples were often associated to large open spaces: fenced courtyards with altars, raised podiums and favissae, which housed various religious activities and returned a rich cultic equipment (e.g., offering and libation tables, incense stands, figurines, ritual pottery vessels). At the same time, open-air cultic precincts characterize the Middle Bronze Age settlements: these areas of worship included different installations (platforms, altars, standing stones) and votive pits with offerings of various organic and non-organic materials. Hence, open cult spaces independent or associated with temples, were important communal focal points of worship and had a multi-functional character: they were the center of offering rituals, libations and sacrifices, feasting and commensality, final deposition of cultic material, festivals and processions, which involved the members of the community (possibly even at the end of pilgrimages)",-2000,-1550,1644,1184,Maura Sala,2022-07-19 10:52:58.543 +0200,2022-09-20 11:47:25.674 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1458,Mbuti,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mbuti are a traditionally hunting and gathering-based society located in the Ituri Forest of what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Mbuti are also typically divided by hunting method: some bands use archery for hunting, while others use a net-hunting method (Beierle, 1995:1). This entry focuses on the net-hunting Mbuti located near the village of Epulu in 1950. At this time, the region had been under Belgian control for over 70 years. However, most cultural contact occurred with the neighboring Bantu villages, many of whose traits (including language and circumcision) the Mbuti adopted. Mbuti religion centers around the relationship of the society to the forest, which is understood to be sacred and to protect the Mbuti. The deity worshiped by the Mbuti (referred to by many different names) is simultaneously benevolent and a god of death, and is, by some understandings, the forest itself. A ceremony called the molimo is undertaken at various crises, during which songs are sung and noise is made to “wake up” the forest. Satani, tricky and clever spirits that were once people, are also important in Mbuti religion, and especially in the improvisatory legends (Beierle, 1995:5). For the Mbuti, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social life.

1459,Famen Monastery 法門寺,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Famen Monastery 法門寺 was an important center of imperial cult during the Tang dynasty. A Fufeng area 扶風 (northwest of modern-day Xi’an) gazetteer dates the foundation of the so-called Aśoka Monastery to the year 67 CE, when one of the Buddha's finger bones was supposedly interred in that area. Excavated Han dynasty tiles have also led some to corroborate the theory that this presumed first iteration of Famen Monastery was indeed founded in the first century. In c. 555 CE, a Northern Wei general would have translated the finger bone to its location at the newly established Famen Monastery. However, by the seventh century the site was in ruins as a result of the anti-Buddhist policies enacted during the Northern Zhou persecution of Buddhism (574-577). The Buddhist historian Daoxuan 道宣 (596-667) noted that a new monastery and pagoda structure was erected by Emperor Wen (r. 581-604) of the Sui dynasty near a place called Phoenix Spring, south of Mount Qi 岐山. At that time, Emperor Wen conferred the name Chengshi Monastery 成實寺 on this complex. The monastery once again fell into disrepair until ithe year 618 when monks from nearby Baochang Monastery 寶昌寺 petitioned the newly crowned Tang Emperor Gaozu for support in re-establishing Famen. However, as the Tang established control over the territory, Famen was most likely used as a fortified garrison against brigands and was destroyed. It was not until 632 under Emperor Taizong that it was properly renovated, at which point multiple relics including the revered finger bone of the Buddha were discovered within the pagoda's foundations on the monastery grounds. A prophesy discovered at that time stated that every thirty years miraculous events would occur and the relic would need once more to be taken out and presented to the people. Indeed, during the Tang dynasty the finger bone was translated to the capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang six times: in 660, 704, 760, 790, 819, and for the last time in 873. The pagoda containing the finger bone constructed during the Tang, also known as the True Body pagoda, stood tall until 1596. The octagonal pagoda built to replace it in 1609 stood thirteen stories tall and remained intact until 1981 when it crumbled after heavy rainfall. In 1987, six years after the True Body pagoda crumbled, the Famen complex was excavated leading to the discovery of a treasure trove of cultural artifacts dating back to the Han through to the Ming dynasty. Of particular importance was the Tang dynasty Famen pagoda crypt last sealed in 874, which had escaped the attention of looters and remained perfectly intact. The same is regrettably not true of the Ming dynasty crypt above it. There is today in Fufeng county a very modern reconstruction of Famen Monastery which sits at the epicenter of a 150 acre park called the ""Famen Temple Cultural Scenic Area"". The monastery still claims to hold one of the Tang's most revered Buddhist relics which was discovered by archeologists in 1987: the Buddha's finger bone.",67,960,1617,1073,Nelson Landry,2022-07-21 14:29:22.275 +0200,2022-09-27 21:03:02.026 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1460,"Acheiropoietos basilica, Thessaloniki",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of the Acheiropoietos (meaning not made by hands in Greek), dedicated to the Mother of God is located to the south-eastern part of the city of Thessaloniki (Northern Greece). It was called thus because it housed a miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary Hodegetria. The church built in the third quarter of the 5th century is the oldest among those of the city of Thessaloniki still standing and it was constructed on a Roman public baths complex, parts of which are still visible underneath and around the building. The monument was repaired during the 7th century, after the earthquake of 620-630, while the other important phase of interventions dates to the late Byzantine period (14th-15th centuries). After the Ottoman conquest of Thessaloniki in 1430, the church was converted into a mosque, called “Eski Camii”. A minaret was added in the southwest corner. After the city’s liberation in 1912 it was again converted into a church and the minaret was demolished.
Acheiropoietos is a three-aisled timber-roofed basilica with galleries above the two lateral aisles, measuring 51.90 m by 30.80 m. The side exterior walls are 14 m high, while the top of the roof of the central aisle lies at a height of 22 m. The building was initially larger, as indicated by the initial exonarthex to the west, the western gallery, the outer portico to the north and the skylight of the central aisle that do not survive today. The modern roof of the church, which is lower than the original was rebuilt. The central nave, which ends at the semi-circular sanctuary with the synthronon and the bishop’s throne, is divided from the lateral aisles by two marble colonnades. To the east side of the north aisle was added in the Middle Byzantine period the chapel of saint Irene. Traces of the staircase leading to the galleries are still preserved in the north-west corner of the basilica, while the annex of the south side is thought to have been the baptistery.
The floors of the central, the south aisles and of the chapel of saint Irene are covered by slabs of marble from the time of the church. Part of the mosaics that have belonged to the earlier bath-house still survive beneath the floor of the north aisle. Fragments of the 5th-century mosaic decoration that includes crosses, geometric patterns, plants, fishes and birds, chalices and baskets are still preserved: i) in the colonnade intrados on the ground floor and south gallery; ii) in the narthex; and iii) in the window of the west wall. Their dating was based on the inscription on the intrados of the south and central arch of the tribelon that mentions the donor of the mosaics (and maybe also of the basilica), Andreas, identified as the priest who participated at the Council of Chalcedon of 451, representing the Archbishop of Thessaloniki. More recently it was suggested that Andreas was probably an Archbishop of Thessaloniki.
The wall above the south colonnade is adorned with frescoes from the first decades of the 13th century. From the composition, which was depicting the Forty martyrs of Sebasteia, only eighteen of the figures have survived. They are represented either full-length or in bust wearing military uniform, each holding a cross. At either end of the row of martyrs was painted a candlestick with a lighted candle. Small traces of wall-paintings are also preserved in the chapel of saint Irene. The monolithic ambo, fragments of the mosaics and the sculptural decoration of Acheiropoietos basilica are exhibited at the Museum of Byzantine Culture of Thessaloniki.",450,1430,1618,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-07-21 18:29:20.181 +0200,2022-07-22 16:13:23.049 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1461,Saami,43,Religious Group (v6),"Historically, the Saami are a society of reindeer pastoralists who reside near or north of the Arctic circle in what is now Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Some Saami settlements are nomadic and others are permanent. The regions occupied by the Saami are collectively known as Sapmi or Same-eatnam (Anderson and Beach, 1996:1). This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence collected among the Saami in the Könkämä District of Sweden from 1948-1952, at which time forced assimilation had resulted in mass conversion of the Saami from the traditional shamanic religion to Lutheran Christianity, as well as population loss, increased sedentarization, and loss of historical political structures (Anderson and Beach, 1996:2-7). While there is little explicit information on religion amongst the Saami for the time and place focus of this entry, religion appears to have been important in everyday life for the entire community. Church attendance was regular, as well as rituals such as baptism and confirmation. Reindeer herders worked in multiple shifts on holidays, with churches holding multiple ceremonies to accommodate them (Pehrson, 1957:14). For the Saami, religious beliefs are inseparable from almost all aspects of social life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1935,1960,1619,1090,Anj Droe,2022-07-23 21:48:25.575 +0200,2022-08-29 16:51:17.400 +0200,eHRAF
1463,"Church of Panagia (Our Lady) Angeloktisti, Kition",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of Panagia Angeloktisti (meaning “built by angels” in Greek) was erected in the village of Kiti in Cyprus. According to the foundation legend, the population of ancient Kition moved to the present village of Kiti for fleeing the Arab invasions. In their new dwelling they set about to build a church in honour of the Virgin. During the construction of the church, the foundations had moved to a different location overnight. After the occurrence of the miracle, they continued to build the church on the new site and returned every morning to find that work had progressed overnight in their absence. Many claimed to have seen an army of angels building the church and hence they proclaimed it “Angeloktisti”. Yet, almost nothing is known for certain about the early settlement of the village and the foundation of the church.
The present structure was built in the 11th century, over the ruins of a 5th-century basilica that was destroyed most probably around the 7th or the 8th century. The columnar basilica had three aisles, an eastern apse, lateral apsidioles, and a wooden roof. It combined a variety of decorative elements, including an apse mosaic, marble revetments, and stucco relief. The exposed stucco on the east wall suggests that the mosaic was always confined to the space of the apse conch.
The apse with the semi-circular synthronon and the famous mosaic depicting the Virgin of the earlier basilica was incorporated into the domed cross-in-square 11th-century structure. The current form of the church is a result of later additions and alterations. In the 12th century, a barrel-vaulted chapel dedicated to saints Kosmas and Damianos was added to the north. Between the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century, another chapel –the so-called Latin chapel– was built to the south for the needs of the Catholic population. The three coats-of-arms that still survive above the Latin chapel’s entrance belong to the Frankish family Gibelet, who have been the patrons of the chapel. The presence in the chapel of the tombstone of Simone Renier de Gibelet, who died in 1302 confirms this. It furthermore suggests that the chapel may have had a funerary character.
The mosaic in the conch of the apse is considered one of the most significant and elaborate mosaics of the Early Christian period. It was likely created in the 6th century. It depicts the Virgin standing on a stool, holding Christ in her left arm, against a golden background. On the Virgin’s right is Archangel Michael and on her left is Archangel Gabriel. The Archangels hold a sceptre and offer a globe with a cross to the Virgin and Child. The mosaic is the oldest, surviving monumental representation of the standing Virgin holding the Child with her left arm. On the inscription she is referred to as “Η ΑΓΙΑ ΜΑΡΙΑ” (“Holy Mary”) instead of Theotokos (“Mother of God”). Hence, the inscription is intriguing, since the Virgin is named thus only in the Monophysite districts of Anatolia. The mosaic is surrounded by a border that depicts a total of six fountains flanked by pairs of confronted or addorsed animals (stags) or birds (ducks, parrots). The mosaic has two decorative borders. At the base of the mosaic the border is wide with geometric and floral decoration. Beneath the lower border is a narrow border with a crowstep pattern in red and white. The apse mosaic was framed by stucco decoration.
The church was decorated with wall-paintings in the 13th century which were uncovered in the main church and the north chapel. Fragments of paintings from the 14th, and 15th to 16th centuries also survive, with overpainting ascribed to the 18th century. The church is furnished with a wooden iconostasis of the 16th century.
The Church of Panagia Angeloktisti was submitted as a possible UNESCO World Heritage Site in September 2015 and is currently listed on the Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.",400,1500,1621,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-07-28 10:27:23.414 +0200,2022-12-13 12:27:32.582 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1465,Temple of Ninurta at Nimrud (ancient Kalhu),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The temple of Ninurta is located on the citadel of the Neo-Assyrian city of Kalhu (also known as Nimrud). Kalhu was an imperial capital from 883-706 BCE but had a longer history as an Assyrian city from around 1350 to 610 BCE. The temple was part of a wider architectural landscape of temple complexes and palaces on the citadel, first begun by Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883-859) but sustained and renovated by subsequent Neo-Assyrian kings and local governors. Located at the northern end of the citadel, the temple was immediately north of Ashurnasirpal II’s new palace, southwest of the Ishtar-Sharrat-Niphi temple, and southeast of a ziggurat, which was also dedicated to Ninurta. Although Ashurnasirpal II explicitly states in inscriptions on the temple walls that the structure is a temple to Ninurta, the composite nature of Assyrian deities at the time may have meant that Ninurta shared visual aspects with the Assyrian gods Enlil and Ashur. By the Neo-Assyrian period, Ninurta was a god of war and agriculture. This variability could have been reflected in elements of temple decoration, relief iconography, and cult statues located therein. Archaeological finds from Nimrud are located in museums in Baghdad and Mosul, as well as in at least 74 other museums worldwide.

Many archaeological projects have excavated in this area of Kalhu, but the temple itself has not been fully excavated and published architectural plans do not agree upon the relationship of the temple to surrounding structures. Until recently, Ashurnasirpal II’s palace and main temples on the citadel, including the area of the Ninurta temple and ziggurat, were maintained as an archaeological park to encourage tourism and public engagement with the site. However, in 2015 Daesh destroyed the vast majority of unearthed structures on the citadel. Restoration projects are currently underway to recover the site.",-865,-612,1623,1202,Glynnis Maynard,2022-08-02 18:50:43.385 +0200,2022-08-05 15:48:01.938 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1466,Islamic modernists,43,Religious Group (v6),"""Islamic modernists"" (hereafter ""modernists"") can be described as thinkers who try to reinterpret or ""reform"" practices, institutions, norms, and foundational texts of Islam in line with what they understand to be the challenges of modernity. They are a capacious ""group"" active since roughly the start of the 19th century, working in a variety of settings within and outside of ""the Muslim world,"" especially in governments and educational centres, from traditional mosque-universities in the Middle East and North Africa to universities in Europe and North America. Historians argue that modernists were at their most prominent from the late 19th to the mid-20th century, in other words, during the most intensive period of colonialism in Africa and Asia. Subsequently, they lost much of their momentum and were increasingly peripheral in intellectual and political debates. Historians offer different explanations for the waning of the modernist project. For instance, Henri Lauzière (2016) argues that the need for unity in anti-colonial movements in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) provided a supportive context for modernism (he uses the Arabic term, ""al-islah al-mua'tadil,"" ""moderate reform""), which shifted towards a conservative, ""purist"" Salafism when activists and intellectuals drifted apart after independence. In his 2018 monograph, Islam in Pakistan, Muhammad Qasim Zaman links the weakness of modernists to their failure to establish a social base comparable to that of 'ulama' (Muslim scholars) and Islamists, and their tendency to ally themselves with authoritarian rulers. The mid-20th century historian Albert Hourani suggests that modernists ""opened the door to"" secularism. This was inadvertent, since the modernist goal was to steer a ""middle way"" between tradition and secularism, broadly defined. From another perspective, historians such as James McDougall explore the modernist investment in (secular) nationalism. To sum up this literature, it can be said that modernists gave way to both secularism and Islamism, the balance between these forces depending on place and time. Today, those who position themselves as successors of 19th and 20th century modernists include everyone from ""liberal"" and ""secular"" intellectuals to leaders of Islamist political parties. 

Scholarship on modernists addresses not only ""the Muslim world,"" but also areas such as Britain, Germany, Canada, and the United States, since some modernists have had careers at western universities. To indicate modernism's broad geography, the map with the present entry encompasses western Europe along with several representative universities in North America, specifically McGill University and the University of Chicago. These are among the key institutions highlighted in the 2021 book by Megan Brankley Abbas, Whose Islam? The Western University and Modern Islamic Thought in Indonesia.

The question of what to select as an ""end date"" for modernists is complex, partly because of the success of modernism at Euro-American universities. A case can be made for describing modernism as an ongoing movement, but I have selected 1980 to indicate the precariousness of modernists in the regions where they first emerged and on which their ambitions have focused, the MENA, South Asia, South-East Asia, Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.",1800,1980,1624,1209,Julian Weideman,2022-08-02 23:03:03.111 +0200,2022-10-20 06:53:38.106 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1468,Eastern Christianity From Nicaea to Chalcedon,43,Religious Group (v6),"The main task of the Council of Nicaea (325) was, on the one hand, the unanimous condemnation of the Arian heresy by all members of the Council. On the one other, the unanimous acceptance of a common and binding theological basis for the restoration of the unity of the bishops of the East. The first was achieved after long synodical procedures and discussions between the various theological groups. The second was founded on the baptismal symbol of the Church of Caesarea in Palestine, which was significantly improved after theological objections, with the addition of clearly anti-Arian terms, and was accepted after the various interventions of the emperor Constantine. The Council of Nicaea was motivated by the Trinitarian debates caused by the views of Arius (256-336). The purpose of the council was to clarify the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity as completely as possible and to faithfully express the teaching of Scripture. Arius wished to make the relation of the Father to the Son comprehensible. He and his followers equated the limits of their understanding with the limits of reality: what they could not conceive, could not therefore be. They held that the Father and the Son were of similar substances, but Jesus did not share in the same divine substance of the Father, He was not fully divine in the same way as the Father. Furthermore, Arius denied both the personality and deity of the Spirit. He considered it to be an impersonal causal agent, definitely not divine, operating as the power by which God the Father worked in creation. Although Arius’s views were condemned by the Synod of Alexandria in 321, the spread of Arianism made it clear that the Apostles’ Creed was no longer sufficient to protect orthodoxy. The Council of Nicaea, however, did not put an end to the controversies, but only gave the parties a new rallying point, initiating a half century of theological turmoil that was marked by political interference and changing fortunes for Athanasius of Alexandria and his supporters (the Orthodox party) and Arianism. In 381, one hundred and fifty bishops met in Constantinople, at the Council summoned by the emperor Theodosius I, with the view to declare the faith of the Nicene Creed in its original form, as the sole legitimate religion in the empire, and to condemn all forms of Arianism. The controversy between the parties at Nicaea and Constantinople raged over the proper term to express the kind of substance that the Trinity shares. The debate focused on the terms homoiousios and homoousios. Though the words look very similar, both meaning “of the same substance” they were poles apart in what they conveyed about the nature of Jesus. The difference was whether the Son is of the same or a similar substance with the Father. The Orthodox party favored the term “homoousios”, “of the same essence,” to describe the relation of the Son to the Father. This term identified the Son sharing the same essence with the Father as uncreated and essential in His existence. The Arian party preferred the term “homoiousios”, “like the Father” or “of a like essence with the Father.” Christology hence was the main concern. At the request of the Archbishop of Constantinople Nestorius, Emperor Theodosius II called together all the major bishops of the Eastern and a few of the Western Roman Empire to meet at Pentecost of 431 in Ephesus, in an effort to resolve the Christological question. Nestorius, who had been trained in the theological tradition of the school of Antioch, was reluctant in calling the Virgin Mary “Theotokos” (Mother of God) and preferred to speak of her as “Christotokos” (mother of Jesus as the one united with the Logos). Nestorius’s opponents accused him for detaching Christ’s divinity and humanity into two persons existing in one body, thereby denying the reality of the Incarnation. Accusations against Nestorius had focused on the claim that he divided Christ and was affirming two Christs and two Sons, a man and God, by considering the union of man and God in Christ as merely an external union. One of the main opponents of Nestorius, besides Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria (376-444 CE), was the influential monk Eutyches of Constantinople, whose opposition to the teachings of Nestorius led him to an equally extreme, although opposite view. He promoted an extreme Monophysite (i.e. one divine nature) teaching which denied that Christ is co-substantial with humankind. Eventually, Emperor Marcian and his wife Pulcheria summoned a Council which met at Chalcedon in 451. The Council of Chalcedon was directed at the Nestorian and Eutychean heresies, which, although concurred with the Nicene Creed, they however worked out the deity of Jesus Christ in false relation to His humanity. The error of Nestorius and his teaching was the failure to unite the two natures in one person. Each nature represented separate persons in some way possessed by the man Jesus. Eutyches and his teaching drew the opposite conclusion: the human nature was subsumed by the divine nature, producing thus a hybrid and unique kind of nature. The Council of Chalcedon affirmed the unity of Jesus’s person and the duality of His natures, as well as His identity with the divine substance and pointed to four principles for an accurate understanding of Jesus: deity, humanity, the unity of one person, and the distinction of the two natures. These define the boundaries of orthodoxy.",325,451,1626,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2022-08-04 15:03:10.496 +0200,2022-08-09 15:50:34.750 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1469,Huamachuco Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Huamachuco area, located in the Peruvian Northern Highlands at about 3,000 meters above sea level, was approximately occupied since the Initial Period (2000 – 1000 BCE) by people practicing both camelid herding and mixed farming (e.g. tubers, maize, fruits, etc…). The dispersed households of the Colpa phase (until 900 BCE) were followed by a three-tier settlement system during the Sausagocha phase (900-200 BCE). Even though some sites may have featured special structures with a ceremonial function, this area was not influenced by the pan Andean Chavín cult. The following Purpucala phase (200 BCE – 300 CE) may have been marked by a population increase, the possible emergence of elites, and an increase in warfare and interaction with the Cajamarca area and the Callejón de Huaylas. The first examples of monumental architecture (residential structures called circular galleries) also appeared during this phase. People kept growing and large, monumental sites spread during the later Early Huamachuco phase (300 – 600 CE), including the well-known ceremonial site of Marcahuamachuco. Sites with monumental architecture were close to each other, had different functions, and were likely part of the same settlement system. The complex composed of Cerro Sazón and Cerro Tuscan may have been the political core of the settlement system. In the Amaru phase (600 – ca. 800 CE) the area was briefly influenced by the Wari state (Peruvian Central Highlands), especially at the shrine of Cerro Amaru, with no major impact on the settlement patterns. The unfinished site of Viracochapampa may represent an attempt by Cerro Sazón/Tuscan elites to replace Marcahuamachuco as the main ceremonial center in the area. However, in the Late Huamachuco phase (ca. 800 – 1000 CE) the importance of Cerro Sazón/Tuscan decreased, the monumentality of Marcahuamachuco kept growing, and the importance of the site reached its peak. During the Tuscan phase (1000 – 1470 CE), monumental construction stopped at Marcahuamachuco and two site clusters emerged, each one likely representing an independent polity. The Santa Barbara phase (1470 – 1532 CE) encompasses the Inka domination of Huamachuco, a time marked by profound social, political, and economic changes in this area. The modern town covers the Inka administrative center, and storage rooms ('qollqa') surrounded the settlement. While no written accounts are available about the sociopolitical organization and religious practices of the Huamachuco people, archaeological investigations and colonial documents provide us valuable information, especially about the late prehispanic phases. Niched halls, which were found at various sites including Marcahuamachuco and Viracochapampa, were key ceremonial buildings. These structures were roofed rectangular structures featuring niches along the walls and were built since the Early Huamachuco phase. Bones of ancestors were placed in the niches, and lineage-based feasts were celebrated in these buildings. Such celebrations highlighted the autonomy of the communities living in the area, and an ideology centered around the unity of community members eventually prevailed over the idea of an elite-dominated society expressed by the rich mausoleum (300 - 600 CE) found at the pilgrimage center of Cerro Amaru. The document (Relación) written by the Augustinian friars residing in Huamachuco around 1560 has shed light on myths, deities, rituals, and places considered sacred ('wak'as') by Huamachuco people, leading archaeologists to identify what was deemed the ancestral place of origin of this group (Cerro Huacate) and the oracular sanctuary (Cerro Icchal) dedicated to Catequil, the principal deity of Huamachuco.",300,1532,1627,1198,Amedeo Sghinolfi,2022-08-05 18:57:24.743 +0200,2022-09-22 18:11:42.362 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1471,Book of Ezekiel,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Ezekiel is one of the prophetic books (Nevi’im) canonized in the Hebrew Bible. It is a text of 48 chapters associated with the sayings and actions of the priest-prophet Ezekiel. Ezekiel is identified as one of the Judean elites exiled by the Neo-Babylonian empire alongside King Jehoiachin of Judah in 597 BCE. The book is set during the period 593-571 BCE and largely reflects the viewpoint of this first group of Judean exiles, who were displaced before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple and additional Judean migrations in 587 BCE. The earliest text of the book of Ezekiel was composed in Hebrew and has been preserved in slightly differing versions: the Masoretic text and fragments from Qumran and Masada in Hebrew, and the Old Greek and an alternative version attested by Papyrus 967 in Greek. The existence of alternative Greek versions of the text indicates that redactional activity on the book of Ezekiel was still taking place at the time of the book’s translation into Greek, probably during the second century BCE. This means that, although many aspects of the book (including its language) reflect its sixth century BCE setting, some parts of it can be attributed to editors from later periods. The text consists of different genres, including narratives about the prophet Ezekiel’s call and sign acts; descriptions of his visions; oracles attributed to the god Yahweh addressed to Judeans in Babylonia and in Jerusalem; and a lengthy law code (chapters 40-48) describing the reconstruction of Yahweh’s temple and the activities that will take place in it. The book of Ezekiel’s primary message is that the Babylonian exile and destruction of Jerusalem are Yahweh’s punishment for the Judeans’ wrongdoing, including their worship of other gods and other cultic transgressions; violent mistreatment of their fellow Judeans; and constantly shifting alliances between foreign nations. Hope for the future is only possible for the Judeans in exile, who have the chance to accept their punishment, continuing to identify as Yahweh’s people and anticipating the day when Yahweh will give them “new hearts and a new spirit” that will allow them (or their descendants) to finally be faithful to him.",-593,-100,1629,1214,Rosanne Liebermann,2022-08-09 11:13:50.948 +0200,2022-08-09 11:29:07.301 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1472,Petra Great Temple,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The capital of the Nabataean kingdom was the city of Petra. In the heart of Petra lay the Great Temple, an enormous complex for worship and community gatherings. Given its prominent location in the center of Petra’s main valley, the Great Temple was the dominant building in the city’s skyline. While the use of the Great Temple remains at the center of on-going debate, the various phases of building show the its integration with the cultural and political development of the city and her people from the height of independent Nabataea to its annexation by Rome. Theories about the Great Temple range from a purely religious center for worship to the palace for the king, as well as many combination of the two options. Archaeological excavations have added more questions than they have answered, but destruction and rebuilding layers have shown that the Great Temple was in use for over 400 years. Given that Nabataea was highly dependent on foreigners for trade and the kingdom’s economic prosperity, it stands to reason that the Great Temple played at least a moderate role in the bureaucratic regulation of the state and its markets. Located directly next to the Pool/Garden complex or “lower” market area, as well as the “middle” and “upper” markets, the Great Temple was uniquely positioned to provide structure and support to the activities taking place in the center of the city. This is not to say that it did not have a religious function as well. In many polytheistic societies, religious practice is intertwined with daily political and economic decisions. As such, the worship of Dushara, the Nabataean high god, was linked to the Propylaeum and the burning of incense and prayer would have been clearly visible to visitor and passerby.  However, “Nabataean religion” included many practices were scattered across the city to various sacred areas. Triclinia, both public and private, indicate feasting on small and larger scales. Sacrifices were particularly conducted in the sacred high places in the mountains around Petra. The Propylaeum areas for worship, then, may indicate that the Great Temple was a space for the king, as Dushara is a patron deity of the monarchy of Nabataea.",-100,200,1638,1188,Anna Accettola,2022-08-10 00:52:45.718 +0200,2022-08-18 16:24:25.866 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1473,Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Ishtar's Descent to the Netherworld is perhaps the most famous myth about the Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and social connections, Ishtar. Ishtar’s Descent is known from its Sumerian and Akkadian versions, with the Sumerian considered to be the earlier text. Although there is some variation between the two texts, the main narrative is relatively consistent in the earlier and later versions.

The narrative describes the journey of Ishtar to the Mesopotamian underworld, the domain of her sister, Ereshkigal. Ishtar is killed in the underworld, and Ea (wisdom deity) must find a way to revive her - as all earthly fertility has ceased. Finally, Ishtar is released from the Netherworld, but must provide a substitute in her place.

Ishtar’s connection to death is an area where modern understanding is limited, yet her own experience of death is uniquely connected to her transgressive nature, seen in her broader image. Ishtar’s ability, demonstrated in myth, to visit the underworld and then to return to the land of the living, is a powerful manifestation of her supernatural qualities. Inanna’s unique expertise in entering and escaping the underworld is likely to be a leading cause for her association with death, the afterlife, and the voyage in between. 

Iconographic evidence, such as the Burney Relief, appear to reflect the goddess’ associations with death, and the myth of the Descent may also be connected to the deity’s role in healing. Ishtar’s healing ability is a prominent aspect of her close relationship with the Mesopotamian king. Among many blessings, she is said in hymns to give the king “life.” Although the granting of “life” is a complex blessing, several texts reference the goddess’ ability to add years to a lifespan, with the implied benefit of forestalling death. At other times, she is credited with the power to bring the dead back to life.

Like other significant works of cuneiform literature, such as The Epic of Gilgamesh, Ishtar’s Descent was lost from general cultural awareness along with the cuneiform script, which disappeared around the 1st century CE. The recovery of cuneiform in the late 18th century allowed for the reintroduction of the ancient myth, and its divine protagonist, to modern audiences.",-1000,-600,1631,1143,Louise Pryke,2022-08-11 01:16:16.016 +0200,2022-08-17 02:07:55.571 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence collected during fieldwork with the Peruvian Amahuaca around 1960, at which time Amahuaca society had been drastically reduced to a fraction of its former population through a combination of external warfare with encroaching rubber prospectors and introduced disease. In 1960, most of the Amahuaca resided with Protestant or Dominican missionaries (Dole, 2020:1). However, many aspects of the traditional religion were maintained. The Amahuaca believed in a variety of non-human spirits that could reside in specific animals or plants. These spirits were generally feared, but could be manipulated and communicated with (Dole, 2020:7). Magic played an important role in ensuring success in hunting or other risky endeavors. For the Amahuaca, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life.

1483,Khazneh (Petra),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Khazneh, or Treasury, is one of the most famous buildings in Petra, Jordan. Carved into the rock face of the famous ""Rose-Red City,"" the Khazneh is the first building visitors see after leaving the Siq, the dark 160m long rock gorge which functions as entrance and defense for the city. The Khazneh looms far above the visitor’s head and awes them with its rose colored rock and exquisite reliefs of vines, amphorae, and larger-than-life deities and animals. The two story faux temple façade includes Corinthian column capitols and two eagles atop the roof. A depiction of the Egyptian goddess Isis takes center stage of the second story and the divine twine, Castor and Pollux, flank the entrances on the first floor. Though aniconic worship was most prevalent among the Nabataeans, by the time the Khazneh was created, external influences were permeating many aspects of the kingdom. As the Khazneh was the first building visitors saw upon visiting Petra, the amalgamation of deities and their anthropomorphic shapes may have been an attempt to make the city seem more familiar to those from different cultures and religious expectations.
At the very top of the building, an enormous pot or urn has been partially destroyed from gun fire, because it was once believed to be filled with gold – giving the building its nickname “the Treasury.” However, instead of a repository for the wealth of the Nabataeans, the Khazneh is likely a tomb or mausoleum for a king, perhaps Aretas III ""Philhellene"" or Aretas IV ""Who Loves His People."" Three crypts lie below the modern ground level and housed nearly a dozen buried bodies – possibly members of the royal family. Interestingly, these crypts are decorated in typical Nabataean style, with crenelated faces rather than a Greco-Roman style.
The Khazneh has fascinated modern audiences since its rediscovery in 1812. Featured in such popular movies as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the building inspires the imagination and is a favorite picture of the nearly one million tourists who travel to Petra each year.",-100,200,1642,1188,Anna Accettola,2022-08-17 19:06:16.447 +0200,2022-08-18 19:24:13.640 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1484,Mesopotamian Exorcistic Texts,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The corpus of Mesopotamian exorcist texts consists of Sumerian and Akkadian incantations and ritual instructions that were intended to expel evil, heal illness, and protect people and property. The texts were composed and employed by practitioners known as the ‘exorcist’ (Akkadian āšipu or mašmaššu), and the corpus could be referred to in Akkadian as āšipūtu ‘lore of the exorcist’. The earliest incantations date to the pre-Sargonic period (c. 2500 BCE onwards) and precursors of later standard incantations are known from the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods (c. 2100–1500 BCE). The process of canonization and standardization began in Babylonian in the late second millennium BCE, while many texts were grouped into standard series and copied in large numbers under the Sargonid kings of Assyria (8th–7th centuries BCE). Exorcistic texts continued to be copied in temples, school contexts, and private houses in the second half of the first millennium, until the Seleucid and Parthian periods (c. 330 BCE–50 CE). The corpus includes rituals against witchcraft, demons, and ghosts, medical texts, purification rites for people and buildings, and texts concerning materia magica, as well as parallel text production including commentaries and catalogues. The incantations consist of prayers to deities (whose participation was essential to the success of the rituals), addresses to sources of evil and materia magica, and explanations of accompanying ritual actions. The rituals make use of symbolic actions to destroy or expel evil, including manipulation of figurines representing the patient or source of evil, or the transfer of impurities to animal (or rarely human) substitutes. These were often accompanied by purification rites, prophylactic measures, and offerings to deities or sources of evil. The exorcist was also responsible for a number of medical treatments, including diagnosing the causes of illness, and preparing and administering medicines.",-2500,50,1631,1194,Adam Howe,2022-08-18 15:58:45.497 +0200,2022-08-20 17:37:11.124 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1486,Xunzi 荀子,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Xunzi is a work of Early Chinese philosophy that played a key role in consolidating what later became known as Confucian thought. The text is associated with the eponymous figure Xunzi (“Master Xun”) - also known by his name Xun Kuang 荀況 or his title Xun Qing 荀卿 (“Minister Xun”) - who lived during the Warring States period (453-221 BCE). Defending and critiquing Confucius (trad. 551-479 BCE) and Mencius (371-289 BCE?), the Xunzi is often regarded today as the most sophisticated expression of Early Confucian thought. The recent surge of interest in the Xunzi starkly contrasts the work’s mixed reception during much of Chinese imperial history. Enthusiasm for his views began to decline towards the end of the Western Han dynasty (201-6 BCE), and by the Tang 唐 dynasty (618-907 CE), literati favored the Confucian vision proposed by Mencius, identifying Xunzi’s views with early imperial collapse (Goldin 2007). What little is known of Xunzi’s life is assembled from sporadic remarks in the Xunzi itself as well as later sources of dubious historical value, such as Sima Qian’s (c. 139-86 BCE) “Records of the Grand Historian” (Shiji 史記) (Kern 2015). While contradictory accounts of his career have sustained scholarly debates (e.g. Qian Mu 錢穆 1992; Hu Shi 胡適 2005 [1919]), today most accept that Xunzi was born in the northern state of Zhao 趙 around 310 BCE, serving as an official in the states of Qi 齊 and Chu 楚, before his death sometime after the assassination of his patron in 238 BCE (Knoblock 1982). There is also some reason to believe Xunzi lived to see the unification of the first empire under the Qin 秦 dynasty in 221 BCE. His students include some of the most preeminent Qin statesmen, such as Han Fei 韓非 (d. 233 BCE) and Li Si 李斯 (d. 208 BCE), as well as highly influential commentators. The received Xunzi is the result of multiple historical layers of editing and compilation tracing back through Yang Liang’s 楊倞 9th-century edition to the version compiled by palace librarian Liu Xiang 劉向 (79-8 BCE). Liu produced a 32-chapter version entitled Xunqing xinshu 荀卿新書 “The New Book of Xun Qing” by excising 290 duplicate ‘bamboo bundles’ (pian 篇) from 322 bundles of manuscripts circulating at the time (Masayuki 2003: 30-1). The majority of the text plausibly reflects the work of Xunzi himself, if not faithful representations of his views. Even chapters evidently not written by Xunzi, such as “Discussion of Warfare” (“Yibing” 議兵), demonstrate a profound understanding of his pronouncements and appear consistent with his core commitments (Goldin 2011: 89). In terms of style, scholars usually attribute to Xunzi the thematic essays concerned with single topics which constitute the bulk of chapters 1-24. The final eight chapters of the work demonstrate greater stylistic variation and include the two chapters of lesser studied poetry (“Cheng xiang 成相 and “Fu” 賦) (Knechtges 1989: 1-31). In terms of content, Xunzi’s thesis that ‘human nature is bad’ (xing e性惡) has attracted outsize interest. Although traditionally accepted as a direct refutation of Mencius’ claim that ‘human nature is good’ (Feng Yu-Lan 1983), the disagreement is ultimately definitional (Graham 1989). For Mencius, to say ‘human nature is good’ amounted to the claim that given the right circumstances (shi 勢), human beings have the potential to fully develop their Heaven-sent predispositions (duan 端, lit. “sprouts”) for ethical action, so long as they continually ‘reflect’ (si 思) on their behaviour. For Xunzi, however, to say ‘human nature is bad’ meant humans will not approach virtue if left to follow their innate tendencies at birth – namely, desiring profit (li 利), sensory gratifications (er mu zhi yu 耳目之欲), and benefits. Only through the intervention of what is external to ‘human nature’ – namely, ‘artifice’ (wei 偽) or the teachings and rituals (li 禮) inaugurated by the ancient sage-kings to modulate human emotions – can humans retrain their innate proclivities and accrue virtue. Xunzi thus refutes Mozi’s 墨子 (fl. ca. 430 BCE) claims that state ritual merely squanders state resources without providing any benefits. On the contrary, the benefits of ritual lie in its power to reshape our emotional responses, generate human communities, and forge a more harmonious world. Against contemporaneous claims that ritual functions to control spirits (shen 神) and the natural world, Xunzi asserted the use of their emotional impact (Puett 2002: 183-88). As cultural forms (wen 文) which make plain differences between noble/base, high/low – or the ‘foundations’ (ben 本) of the natural world - rituals modulate our emotional engagements so that we might align ourselves with hierarchical social realities. Moreover, correct rituals entail bodily benefits, such as regulating vital energy (qi 氣) and sensory acuity. Although Heaven (tian 天) is an important concept to Xunzi, contrary to the claims of contemporary ritual specialists and self-cultivation practitioners, it is a subject with which we need not overly concern ourselves. Whereas for Mengzi, Heaven appears as a wilful agent, for Xunzi it is nothing more than the insensate structural reality of the cosmos. One should simply acknowledge the reality of Heaven’s regularities and irregularities and account for these in developing a ‘human Way’. Due to the historical marginalization of Xunzi, there are fewer commentaries than for other major works of Early Chinese thought. However, interest began to pick up during the mid-Qing dynasty 清 (1636-1912) when a number of prominent scholars - Xie Tang 謝塘, Wang Zhong 汪中, Wang Niansun 王念孫, among others - published commentaries and corrections to Yang Liang’s edition. Among the most important editions of the Xunzi today are Yan Lingfeng’s 嚴靈峯 (1904-1999) Wuqiubeizhai Xunzi jicheng 無求備齋荀子集成, which compiles a staggering amount of annotations, commentaries, and scholarship from the Song dynasty 宋 (960-1276 CE) onwards, and includes major contributions from Japanese scholars. The most-cited version today, however, is Wang Xianqian’s 王先謙 (1842-1918) work Xunzi jijie 荀子集解 which contains many invaluable commentaries (including the Qing contributions), key corrections, and clarifications.",-310,-215,467,1203,Henry Jacobs,2022-08-18 22:08:28.868 +0200,2022-09-11 17:24:04.264 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence that reconstructs the life of the Naknenuk subtribe of the Krén, a Botocudo group inhabiting the upper Rio Mucuri around 1884 (Nimuendajú, 1946:97). Krén religion is characterized by a belief in multiple (up to six) souls, one of which resides in the body and dies alongside it, and the presence of a host of supernatural beings known as tokón or marét that dwell in the sky. The marét have a chief, who functions essentially as a supreme high god. Shamans (who are often also chiefs) have the ability to communicate with the marét, and through them the supreme high god, and do so frequently as part of medicinal practices (Skoggard, 2020:3). For the Krén Botocudo, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life.

1489,Laojun Shan (Mountain of Lord Lao),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Mountain of Lord Lao (Laojun Shan 老君山) in Xinjin 新津 district, Sichuan 四川 province, has been identified as the center of a former diocese of Celestial Master Daoism (Tianshi Dao 天師道). Moreover, it is well-known as a sanctuary for the worship of Laozi 老子. The temple on Mt. Laojun is today an active religious institution that belongs to the Dragon Gate (Longmen 龍門) lineage of Complete Perfection (Quanzhen 全真) Daoism. In the late Qing dynasty and Republican times, the temple was closely connected with the influential Liu School (Liumen 劉門) tradition, which was founded by the Confucian scholar Liu Yuan 劉沅 (1768–1856). 
The district of Xinjin is located in the western part of the Sichuan basin, southwest of the provincial capital Chengdu 成都. About two kilometers south of the district town, the Mountain of Lord Lao (Laojun Shan) rises up amidst a ridge of hills, surrounded by the rivers Minjiang 岷江 and Nanhe 南河. Mt. Laojun, a cone‑shaped hill, is only 617 meters high, but it figures prominently among the historic sites of Xinjin and remains a famous sanctuary for the worship of Lord Lao 老君, the deified Laozi. Although the traditional temple complex, hidden in a cypress grove on the summit, received its present shape only in the first half of the 20th century, the origins of this sacred site can be traced back to the very beginnings of the Daoist religion. 
“Laojun Shan” is actually a popular designation of the mountain, which only appeared in written sources as late as in the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Two other appellations for this locality can be found in earlier historical and geographical treatises. The first of these, Tianshe Shan 天社山 (Mt. Celestial Altar), probably originated in the designation of a stellar constellation and refers to the ridge of hills south of the district town of Xinjin, of which Mt. Laojun forms a part. However, the name “Tianshe Shan” is still used as synonym for Laojun Shan today. The other appellation, Chougeng Shan 稠稉山 (Mt. Chougeng), matches the name of the old diocese in Daoist sources: Chougeng Zhi 稠稉治 or Chougeng Hua 稠稉化. The exact meaning of chougeng 稠稉 is not clear. The word seemingly designates a medicinal herb or a kind of rice. To my knowledge, the geographical name “Chougeng” only occurs at this locality in Xinjin and does not relate to any other place. 
Legend has it that Lord Lao once dwelled there in a cave and engaged in secluded self-cultivation. This legend is not supported by source texts in the Daoist Canon, but Lord Lao has nevertheless become the central deity who bestows spiritual authority upon the mountain, and the locality and its temple were consequently named after the God of the Dao. While Daozang 道藏 sources report that the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi 黃帝) and Celestial Master Zhang Daoling 張道陵 once stayed at Chougeng Diocese, the legend of Lord Lao’s sojourn on the mountain apparently is based on local lore. 
The sanctuary on top of the mountain, commonly referred to as Laojun Miao 老君廟 (Temple of Lord Lao) or Laozi Miao 老子廟 (Temple of Laozi), currently serves as residence for a community of Daoist clerics and lay adherents. Very little is known about the history of the temple. Summarizing the bits of information contained in a temple bell inscription dated 1796, historical treatises on geography, and local gazetteers, we learn that temple buildings were erected on the mountain starting in the Han (206 BCE–220 CE) and Tang (618–907) dynasties. In 1644, the temple was destroyed by troops of the rebel Zhang Xianzhong 張獻忠 (1606–1647), who set up a short-lived regime in Chengdu. The sanctuary finally underwent reconstruction in the last decade of the 18th century. 
In the late Qing dynasty and Republican times (1912–1949), the sanctuary on Mt. Laojun was closely connected with the Liumen tradition. In 1799, 1821, and 1835, various temple buildings on Mt. Laojun were rebuilt or restored under the auspices of Liu Yuan, the founder and first patriarch of the Liumen tradition. Liu Yuan reportedly had spent some time on this mountain while studying meditation techniques under the guidance of a Daoist hermit, who was eventually considered an incarnation of Laozi in Liumen circles. Since Liumen adherents held Laozi in high esteem, they actively supported and patronized Daoist institutions, in particular those that were dedicated to the cult of Laozi. 
The extant temple buildings on Mt. Laojun were constructed during the Republican era, sponsored by local adherents of the Liumen community. After a devastating fire in 1923, Liu Xianjun 劉咸焌 (1871–1935), a grandson of Liu Yuan and the fourth patriarch of the Liumen movement, supervised the reconstruction of the sanctuary. The architectural ensemble was modelled on the famous Daoist temple Qingyang Gong 青羊宮 (Palace of the Grey Goat) in Chengdu, which was also patronized by the Liumen community. Beside the temple’s main Hall of the Three Clarities (Sanqing Dian 三清殿), a modest shrine hall is situated, its front opening into a walled courtyard. The name of this building is Rulin Ci 儒林祠 (Ancestral Temple of the Literati), and it was erected in honor of Liu Yuan and his descendants. 
After the founding of the People’s Republic of China (1949), the Liumen tradition was outlawed as a “reactionary secret society,” and Mt. Laojun was consequently deprived of its former protectors. After the turmoil of the “Cultural Revolution” (1966–1976), the temple was finally reopened as a religious institution in 1986. While most of its traditional buildings and relics have been preserved, the temple complex on Mt. Laojun was extended by several new edifices in recent years.",142,2022,1647,1085,Volker Olles,2022-08-23 12:10:40.229 +0200,2022-11-17 03:53:16.951 +0100,Mapping Religious Diversity in Modern Sichuan

At the time and place this entry focuses on, Nambicuara religion centered around potentially dangerous spirits and a basic and ubiquitous concept of power believed to be present in living beings and inanimate objects. Shamans were relied on to appease and propitiate the supernatural beings (Boglár, 2010:4-5).

1494,Temple at Tell Afis,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"During the Iron Age, the acropolis of Tell Afis, a site in north-west inner Syria which had been inhabited since the Chalcolithic period, seems to have progressively been reserved for ceremonial buildings, at the expense of residential units. The excavations carried out by the Italian archaeological mission directed by Stefania Mazzoni have brought to light several architectonical structures, different in plan, date and functions, of which the best known has been labelled the AI temple. It is a 38/32 x 28 m building, comprising three rooms (vestibule, a central hall, and a rear room) on the longitudinal axis and additional rooms along the sides. The AI temple was preceded, on the same spot, by an older building, of which, however, only a few remains remain. The hypothesis that these remains belong to a previous temple is suggested by the fact that, in an even earlier phase, dating back to Iron Age I, the same area had been occupied by two buildings, whose nature as shrines is indicated by structural elements as well as by some of the materials found within them, such as the remains of some kernoi (cultic vessels that seem to have been in a particular connection to the figure of the weather-god), and remains of birds in abnormal concentration. These Iron Age I buildings, which were built on top of each other, seem to be separated by a short period of time. The available data do not allow to identify the deities or deities that were worshipped in these shrines. Given the continuity of the cultic use for this area, however, it is possible that in Iron Age I there was worshipped the same deity as that of the later phases. According to an Aramaic inscription, almost certainly from Tell Afis, an important temple, and probably the main sanctuary of the city of Hazrak (the ancient name of the site) was dedicated to the god Ilwer. It is therefore possible that also in the previous phases it was Ilwer who represented the main deity worshipped here. The morphology of Ilwer is not well defined, but he seems to be akin to the figure of the weather-god. It is also possible, however, that Ilwer was not the only deity worshipped in his own temple. It is possible, for instance, that some anatomical votives recovered from the area may point to ritual activities related to the sphere of healing and are perhaps a clue of popular devotion rather than official religion. On the other hand, under Assyrian rule the holder of the temple may have been changed, or official cults related to the ruler may have been introduced (for example, that of the god Sin).",-1100,-600,1769,1041,Giuseppe Minunno,2022-08-27 01:09:28.305 +0200,2022-10-31 18:08:19.577 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1495,Secular Buddhists,43,Religious Group (v6),"Since the end of the 20th century, Secular Buddhist communities have been gathering in-person and growing through English-language online spaces with audiences in the UK, continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the US. The communities with a large online presence include the Secular Buddhist Association and the Secular Buddhist Podcast, founded by Americans Ted Meissner and Noah Rasheta, respectively, and the Secular Buddhist Network, which has a team based primarily in Europe. Secular Buddhists settled on this term over other ways to present themselves, such as atheist Buddhist or agnostic Buddhist. All three terms owe their popularity to the work of Stephen Batchelor, who is based in the UK. His 1997 publication, Buddhism Without Beliefs: A Contemporary Guide to Awakening, mentions “agnostic Buddhist” and “secular agnosticism.”
Those who identify as secular Buddhists typically subscribe to a form of Buddhist modernism that denies metaphysical interpretations of rebirth and karma (though some would allow for psychological interpretations), and the existence of Buddhist deities such as the Medicine Buddha, devas, or wish-granting bodhisattvas. Secular Buddhists tend to focus on teachings found in the Pali Nikayas, neglecting other portions of the Buddhist canon such as Mahayana texts or the vinaya.
An earlier motto of the Secular Buddhist Association sums up secular Buddhism as a “natural, pragmatic approach” to the theory and practice found in the Nikayas. Natural denotes the rejection of the “supernatural” from the standpoint of modern materialist physicalism. By pragmatic, they mean the central practice of quiet sitting meditation is elevated, while Buddhist practices of chanting spells to deities, prostration to statues, and circumambulation around relics are dismissed as unnecessary “superstitious” ritual. They tend to argue their interpretation of Buddhism is scientific and more of a philosophy than a religion, without the need for belief of faith. The goal of quiet sitting is to cultivate insight into the nature of reality, such as three marks of existence: dukkha (suffering or dis-ease), annica (impermanence), and anatta (non-self). This type of meditation is also used to develop focused attention and concentration.
The Secular Buddhist Network recommends a reading that distinguishes secular meditation as different from “traditional Buddhist lineages” because “the purpose of meditation for Secular Buddhists is to cultivate certain virtues and insights which are crucial to promoting human flourishing in this world, not the attainment of nirvana.” Nirvana and the liberation from the cycle of samara are part of the “the cultural and supernatural overlays” that Secular Buddhists reject.
Rasheta, of the Secular Buddhist Podcast, focuses on what works for him and repackages his personal experience with Tibetan and Japanese Buddhist lineages into a form that is “accessible and easy to understand for secular-minded, ‘westerners’ like [him].” In other words, he presents Secular Buddhism as “ancient wisdom” that can help everyone, including those who identify as “Christian, Muslim, Atheist, Hindu, Believer, Non-believer,” etc.",1997,2022,1652,1220,Kin Cheung,2022-08-29 20:44:50.772 +0200,2022-08-31 15:07:35.356 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1498,"Sunan Ampel Great Mosque, Surabaya",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Ampel (1401-1478, also known as Raden Rahmat or Soenan Ngampel) was the son of Sunan Gresik (also known as Maulana Malik Ibrahim Asmarakandi) and the Champa princess Dewi Candrawulan. Sunan Gresik and his descendants collectively constitute the Wali Songo (revered saints of Islam on the island of Java). Each saint bore the Javanese honorific Sunan. Sunan Gresik was instrumental in the proselytization of the Champa kingdom and its inhabitants to Islam. Dewi Dwarawati, Raden Rahmat's aunt (Dewi Candrawulan's sister) was the consort of the Majapahit monarch Brawijaya. In 1443, upon arrival in Java, Brawijaya granted him land in Ampel Denta, Kahuripun (that corresponds to modern Surabaya). Raden Rahmat subsequently entered into a matrimonial alliance with a Javanese princess who was the sister of  the would-be Sunan Kalijaga. 

According to the Babad Ngampeldenta (Javanese chronicle) , Raden Rahmat was invested with the Javanese appellation of Sunan by his uncle Brawijaya. The title Sunan mediated his position not only as an Islamic teacher but also someone who had the authority to impart Diksa or induct students into Islam. Furthermore the Babad Ngampeldenta notes the investiture of Raden Rahmat  with the title ""the Imam of Surabaya"" by the Duke of Surabaya Aria Lembasura. At the same time, Aria Lembasura offered his granddaughter Nyai Ageng Manila in matrimonial alliance to Sunan Ampel. With Nyai Ageng Manila, Sunan Ampel begot Sunan Drajat and Sunan Bonang. 

Sunan Ampel's closeness to the royal family was a part of his Dakwah or Daawa strategy (the act of calling people to embrace Islam). Prior to settling in Surabaya, Sunan Ampel mentored Raden Patah, the son of Brawijaya and converted him to Islam. The latter subsequently refused to acknowledge the suzerainity of the Majapahit monarch. The act of Raden Patah's defiance later led to the establishment of the Sultanate of Demak by 1478. 

A salient feature of Sunan Ampel's dakwah was the syncretism between Javanese cultural traditions (heavily influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism) and Islam. For instance, he incorporated the Javanese custom of Sraddha (homage paid to one's deceased ancestors). 

Historical tradition attributes the construction of the Ampel mosque to Sunan Ampel. The monument cannot be precisely dated. The mosque architecture is a fusion of Javanese and Arab elements. The Javanese influences are apparent in the three-layered roof (Tajuk, the embodiment of Mount Meru of Javanese cosmology) and the five gapuros (entrance gates) to the mosque. 

The tomb of Sunan Ampel is situated right in front of the Ampel mosque. Unlike the tombs of other Wali Songo, the tomb of Sunan Ampel is noted for its simplicity and lacks a cupola as per the saint's last wish. The Juru Kunci (caretaker of the shrine) notes that several years after the demise of Sunan Ampel, a cupola was constructed above the tomb of the saint but strong winds blew it away. East of the mosque is the tomb of Mbah Shonhaji or Mbah Sholeh, an astronomer of Hadhramaut  Arab ethnicity and disciple of Sunan Ampel who fixed the direction of Kiblat (Qibla, the fixed direction to Kaaba in the Grand Mosque in Makkah).

1504,"Tomb of Sunan Giri, Gresik (East Java)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Giri (1442-1506) also known as Joko Samudro, Raden Paku, Muhammad Ainul Yaqin, or Sunan Satmata founded the Islamic principality of Giri (also known as Giri Kedaton). A member of the Wali Songo (revered saints of Islam in Indonesia, particularly Java), Sunan Giri was the son of Maulana Ishak (brother of Maulana Malik Ibrahim or Sunan Gresik). Both Babad Tanah Jawi and Serat Walisana chronicles agree that Sunan Giri descended from the Raja of Blambangan, a vassal of the Majapahit Empire, from his maternal side. The first two rulers of Giri (Sunan Satmata and Sunan Dalem), defended their Islamic principality against depredations of the Majapahit army, according to Javanese chronicles. After the demise of the Majapahit Empire in 1527, Sunan Dalem of Giri succeeded in bringing the port of Gresik under his rule. Dutch contemporaries during the first quarter of the seventeenth century referred to the Sunans of Giri as the "" Moorish Popes"" (Pigeaud and Graaf 1976). Under Sunan Giri's grandson, Sunan Prapen's leadership, the Court of Giri became the epicenter for the propagation of Islam to the Outer Islands of the Indies archipelago, particularly Lombok, Celebes, Borneo, and the Moluccas. Local inhabitants from the Outer Islands of Indonesia revere Sunan Giri as ""Raja Bukit"" (Pigeaud and Graaf 1976). Trained by Sunan Ampel in Ilmu Tasawuf (Sufi mysticism), Sunan Giri became the leader of the Wali Songo in 1478 subsequent to the demise of his mentor and assumed the title of Prabu Satmata (one of the names of Lord Siva in the Javanese language).  A salient feature of Sunan Giri’s dakwah (invitations for people to more fully embrace Islam) was the adjustment of Javanese cultural elements to Islam. For instance, Sunan Giri redesigned the Javanese wayang (shadow) puppets such that they did not contravene the Islamic proscription of representing the human form. Likewise, the architectural elements of the Sunan Giri tomb complex appropriate Javanese architectural elements such that they conform to Islamic principles.",1506,2020,1668,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-09-03 15:29:03.361 +0200,2022-10-25 08:51:05.726 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1508,Zaytuna Magazine/ المجلة الزيتونية,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zaytuna Magazine was an important publication in the reformist milieu of the Zaytuna Mosque-University during the interwar and post-WWII periods of the French protectorate in Tunisia (1881-1956). The magazine ran between 1936 and 1955, producing nine full volumes along with a tenth volume serving as a comprehensive index for the entire print run. Among its notable contributors was Muhammad al-Tahir ibn ʿAshur (محمد الطاهر ابن عاشور, whose name is usually transliterated following the French orthography as ""Mohamed Tahar Ben Achour""), 20th century Tunisia's leading reformist scholar. Ben Achour's typical contribution to the magazine was an article-length Qur'anic commentary (tafsir/تفسير). These articles provided a starting point for his magnum-opus, the thirty-volume Qur'anic commentary, Verification and Enlightenment (التحرير والنتوير), published in 1970 near the end of his life (1879-1970). In addition to Ben Achour's works of exegesis, the Zaytuna Magazine also featured articles discussing, among other topics, the hadith, the shari'a, episodes from the histories of Islam and of Tunisia, and social and political questions related to life in a colonized society. The front cover of the publication ran the following subtitle: ""a learned, literary, and ethical magazine"" (مجلة علمية أدبية أخلاقية). This wording suggests that the specifically ""religious"" content of the magazine should not be overstated. At the same time, the reference to ""Zaytuna"" in the title of the publication indicates its close ties to the mosque-university. For historians, the magazine may be most useful as a window onto the Zaytuna itself, at a time when the mosque-university became the largest centre of Muslim higher education in North Africa.

1509,The Temple Scroll,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Temple Scroll is the longest of the Dead Sea Scrolls, with its prime exemplar, 11QTemplea (11Q19), extending to just over eight metres long. For eleven years after its discovery, the manuscript lay hidden beneath the floorboards of an antiquities dealer in Bethlehem, before being acquired by Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin in 1967 and eventually published in 1977. 11Q19 is dated paleographically to the end of the first century BCE or beginning of the first century CE. A further five manuscripts associated with the Temple Scroll have been subsequently identified and published. The oldest extant manuscript, 4QRouleau du Temple (4Q524) shows considerable overlap with 11Q19 and was dated by its editor, Émile Puech, to c. 150–125 BCE in the early Hasmonean period. Also found in Cave 4 was 4QTemple? (4Q365a), dated to 125–75 BCE. There are significant differences between the fragments which comprise 4Q365a and 11Q19, and it was therefore more likely a source for the Temple Scroll than a copy. Two further manuscripts from Cave 11 have been identified with the Temple Scroll, 11QTempleb (11Q20) and 11QTemplec (11Q21). They have been dated to the first half of the first century CE, and whilst it is clear that 11Q20 is a copy of the Temple Scroll, 11Q21 is too fragmentary to allow for certainty. In 2015, several small fragments from Cave 5 were identified as a further copy of the Temple Scroll and labelled 5QTemplea (5Q21). 5Q21 was dated paleographically to 75–50 BCE by its editor, Alexei Yuditsky. Various dates have been proposed for the Temple Scroll’s composition, ranging from the fifth century BCE to the early first century BCE. The discovery and identification of 4Q524 gave a latest possible date of the end of the second century BCE. Though Yadin identified the composition with the community at Qumran, 4Q524 pre-dates the Qumran settlement. This, combined with the absence of key sectarian terminology, suggests that the Temple Scroll’s origins should be located in a broader social milieu. The contents of the Temple Scroll indicate an interest in the Temple, cultic practices, and an elevated status for the High Priest. It may therefore have emerged from priestly circles. The author/redactor presents the composition as a new Torah, beginning with material from the covenant renewal ceremony in Exodus 34 and continuing through to laws from Deuteronomy. Biblical law is “rewritten” according to the interpretation of the author/redactor and their community, often as first-person speech direct from the mouth of God himself. At the heart of the composition is the description of a plan for a new Temple and its courts (cols. 3–13; 30–45). Alongside the Temple plan are prescriptions for religious festivals and Temple worship (cols. 13–29), purity laws (cols. 45–51), and the Deuteronomic Paraphrase (cols. 51–66), which is an elaboration on a series of Deuteronomic laws. The latter includes the Law of the King (cols. 56–59), which offers a distinctive treatment of kingship. The Scroll is likely composed of several sources, some of which may have circulated independently prior to their incorporation into the scroll by a redactor.",-450,-125,1440,1222,Abigail Naidu,2022-09-08 10:24:05.874 +0200,2022-09-09 11:26:11.745 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1510,"Tomb of Sunan Drajat, Lamongan (East Java)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Drajat (1470-1522)—known variously as Raden Qosim, Masaikh Munat, Raden Syarifuddin, Maulana Hasyim, Pangeran Kadrajat, or Sunan Mayang Madu—was the younger son of Sunan Ampel and Nyi Ageng Manila and a member of the Wali Songo. The Wali Songo collectively refers to the nine founders of Islam on the island of Java. Both genealogical and teacher-pupil relationships establish connections among these figures.  

Sunan Ampel and Sunan Gunung Jati instructed Raden Qosim on Islam. Subsequently, Raden Qosim married Dewi Sufiyah, the daughter of Sunan Gunung Jati and settled in the coastal hamlet of Drajat, not far from Lamongan. Soon after his marriage to Dewi Sufiyah, he engaged in asceticism for three months and earned the appellation of Sunan Drajat. 

Sunan Drajat’s dakwah (act of inviting people to embrace Islam) strategy included: (a) mobilizing villagers in responding to natural calamities based on the Javanese notion of cooperation (gotong royong); and, (b) nurturing empathy for the downtrodden and hard work. The gist of his teachings are reflected in the doctrine of Pepali Pitu (seven basic principles). The architecture at the tomb of Sunan Drajat, located in Drajat village, Lamongan district of East Java, reflects the acculturation of Islam to Javanese culture whilst incorporating elements from Chinese and Champa cultures.",1522,2021,1672,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-09-09 16:02:29.489 +0200,2022-12-05 05:40:25.023 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It expanded its territories to include parts of present-day Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, Chad and Cameroon. The state consisted of a loose collection of emirates pledging allegience to the amir al-mu'minin in Sokoto and was governed with reference to the Maliki school of Islamic law as well as historical precedents from the region and the wider Muslim world. The Qadiri Sufi order and, later, a Hausa identity, were also important factors in Sokoto society. Sokoto officially came to an end in 1903 when Britain annexed parts of its territories to create the protectorate of Northern Nigeria, but Sokoto's legacy and its traditional rulers continue to play an important role in religious and political life in Nigeria.",1804,1903,1673,1228,Paul Naylor,2022-09-09 17:26:37.839 +0200,2022-09-23 17:28:02.956 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1514,"Tomb of Sunan Bonang, Tuban, East Java/Bonang Village Lasem Subdistrict, Central Java (disputed)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Bonang, also known as Raden Makhdum Ibrahim (1465-1525), the younger son of Sunan Ampel and Nyi Ageng Manila, was a member of the legendary Wali Songo, the nine founders of Islam on Java (Fox 2004).  The life of Sunan Bonang is obscure. There is a lack of agreement among primary sources related to events associated with the saint’s life as he was celibate according to most sources and did not have descendants to recount his biography. There is general agreement among primary historical sources that Sunan Ampel mentored his son Raden Makhdum Ibrahim and Raden Paku (the future Sunan Giri) on Islam for a decade. Soon after both students completed their education under Sunan Ampel, they undertook a peregrination to Mecca. On their way to Mecca, they encountered Maulana Ishak at the port city of Malacca (Raden Paku’s father) who dissuaded both students from traveling further. Soon after, as Raden Makhdum Ibrahim and Raden Paku returned to Java, Sunan Ampel commanded the former to travel across Java. For years Raden Makhdum Ibrahim wandered and was eventually guided by the prophet Khidr who showed him the way to the orange jasmine (Javanese: kemuning) grove at a place in Bonang (Quinn 2019).  Raden Makhdum Ibrahim settled here and acquired fame as Sunan Bonang. 

There are several Javanese legends that attest to Sunan Bonang’s contribution to the furtherance of dakwah (the act of inviting people to embrace Islam) across interior Java. His challenge was to reconcile Javanese monism with the dualistic doctrines of Islamic orthodoxy (Quinn 2019). In his dakwah, he deployed Gamelan (the traditional ensemble music of the Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese), consisting chiefly of percussive instruments. 

There is a lack of consensus, apparent in Indonesian and Dutch primary sources, related to the location of the mausoleum of Sunan Bonang. But it is plausible that Sunan Bonang was buried at Tuban, given Schrieke’s research of Javanese legends (1916). Upon Sunan Bonang’s death at Bonang village, the saint’s followers wanted to conduct the saint’s last rites at Ngampel (in today’s Surabaya). As the saint’s mortal remains were shipped by prahu to Ngampel, strong winds blew the vessel towards Tuban.  The sixteenth century Pangeran Bonang Javanese manuscript identifies Tuban as the location of Sunan Bonang’s grave. The tomb of Sunan Bonang at Tuban—reflecting similarities between the Javanese and Chinese architectural styles—is one of the busiest pilgrimage sites in Indonesia, annually hosting more than one million visitors.",1525,2022,1676,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-09-14 10:08:20.498 +0200,2023-01-04 20:22:08.894 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1515,Dura Europos Mithraeum,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The site of Dura Europos was built along the banks of the Euphrates river in present-day Syria. Founded as a fortified settlement in 300 BCE by the Hellenistic king, Seleukos Nikator, at a strategic location in a frontier region. It grew to develop a Hippodameian town plan (orthogonal city blocks) and strong fortification walls and gates. It was conquered by the Parthians in 113 BCE, the Romans in the 2nd c. CE, and destroyed by the Sasanids in 256 CE. Whether the city was completely abandoned after this siege is debated.

Dura was a very multicultural city from its foundation as its various rulers tolerated a vast multiplicity of cultures, ethnicities, languages, and religious traditions. There were many cults from different cultures present in the city co-existing throughout its existence: Parthian, Semitic, Greek, Roman, Jewish, Christian--and hybrid manifestations of these various religious traditions. 

The second Roman conquest of Dura under Lucius Verus coincided with the introduction of the cult of Mithras to the city. A mithraeum (temple to Mithras) was built by Imperial troops in 168 CE in a room at a private house along the NW fortifications of the city. It was renovated and enlarged around 209 and ultimately destroyed in 256 when the space was filled in to strengthen the fortification walls for the impending Sasanid siege. The mithraeum was excavated from 1934-1935 by the joint Yale-French team excavating the city.

1518,"The Tomb of Sunan Kalijaga: Kadilangu Village, Demak Regency (Central Java)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Kalijaga (1450-1513)—also known as Raden Said or Lokajaya in his earlier life—is the most celebrated saint among the Wali Songo. Wali Songo collectively refers to nine saints who contributed to the spread of Islam in Java, according to the eighteenth-century Javanese historical tradition that is reflected in various versions of the Babad Tanah Jawi. 
Born into a Majapahit noble family in Tuban, Raden Said was addicted to gambling and smoking opium. The profligate youth went on to become a notorious highwayman. But when the young man attempted to prey upon the passing Sunan Bonang, his life trajectory changed drastically. Inspired by the magical powers of Sunan Bonang, Raden Said left behind his life of crime. The youth then became Sunan Bonang’s star disciple. After several trials, notably his long watch (Javanese: jaga) over the river Kali, Raden Said earned the appellation of Sunan Kalijaga. 

There is a general consensus amongst historians and anthropologists that Sunan Kalijaga is remembered for his humanity: his distinctive Javaneseness, a devout Muslim and extensive use of wayang kulit (shadow puppetry) in the dakwah strategy (act of inviting people to embrace Islam). He is also remembered for lending credibility to the newly-established Mataram Sultanate. 

According to a legend mentioned in the Babad Tanah Jawi, sometime during the 1470s— when the Wali Songo were busy building the Grand Mosque at Demak in a single day—they were unable to agree on the orientation of the building. Muslims are obligated to pray five times a day facing Mecca towards the Ka’aba. Therefore, mosques are oriented towards the Ka’aba. The Babad Jaka Tangkir chronicle tells us that the structure built by the Wali Songo was not easily brought into alignment with Ka’bah, the material-spiritual center of Islam. The deferral of the settlement of the kéblat (Javanese: to face Mecca/obey) of the Grand Mosque of Demak— as recorded by Javanese historical tradition—highlights the complex process of balancing between traditional customs and Islam. Sunan Kalijaga’s miraculous manipulation of both the Meccan Ka’aba and the Grand Mosque at Demak illustrates the alignment of Islam with Javanese tradition.

The Sunan Kalijaga Mosque at Kadilangu, Demak—adjacent to the tomb of Sunan Kalijaga [not to be confused with the Grand Mosque at Demak]—adopted local features of mosque construction. For example, the tiered roof instead of the Moorish-style dome and minaret. The latter style was introduced as an element of mosque construction at the turn of the twentieth century.",1513,2022,1680,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-09-21 18:07:32.981 +0200,2023-02-03 08:46:19.705 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1519,"The Mausoleum of Sunan Muria, Colo (Central Java)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Muria (d. ~ 1551 AD)—also known as Raden Umar Said—belongs to the younger generation of Wali Songo that include Sunan Kudus. The Wali Songo refers to the nine main saints who introduced Islam on the island of Java between the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. Historians lack definitive details of Sunan Muria’s life as legends blot out what is factually knowable of him. There are two divergent accounts of Sunan Muria’s genealogy. In the first account, the saint is portrayed as the son of Sunan Kalijaga who married Dewi Sujinah, the daughter of Sunan Ngudung (the imam of the Grand Mosque at Demak) and the sister of Sunan Kudus. In the second account, entitled Pustoko Darah Agung, Sunan Muria is the son of Sunan Ngudung and the nephew of Sunan Kalijaga (R. Darmowasito). Nevertheless, it is plausible that Sunan Muria was the son of Sunan Kalijaga as one of his sons earned the appellation of Sunan Adilangu, a title traditionally bestowed by the Sultan of Demak on the descendants of Sunan Kalijaga. Sunan Muria’s dakwah (act of inviting people to embrace Islam) strategy was firmly situated in the everyday lives of the Javanese. In his dakwah, the saint used wayang kulit (a Javanese puppet shadow play) and enacted themes from the Hindu epic Mahabharata but the characters conveyed Islamic themes. Sunan Muria invested the Hindu ritual of shraddha (ceremonies performed in honor of deceased ancestors) with a new Islamic meaning. The pre-Islamic Javanese tradition of offering rice cones to one’s ancestors was replaced with slametan (feast) and Islamic prayers. Apart from incorporating pre-Islamic elements in his dakwah, Sunan Muria also deployed the Javanese practice of tapa ngeli (drifting in the river by self-isolation) such that the radiance of divine light  could enter the conscience. Tapa ngeli was a kind of ascetic self-control. Sunan Muria has bequeathed Javanese Islam its distinct cultural form. 
The mausoleum complex of Sunan Muria—located in Colo village on Mount Muria, a dormant volcano—reflects distinctive elements of Javanese architecture including a wooden cupola of the Sunan Muria mosque. The cupola consists of two overlapping roofs capped by a mustoko or memolo roof finial.  The mustoko—although associated with Brahmamula containers of the essence of divine unity in Hindu cosmogyny—makes its appearance in most Javanese mosques during the sixteenth century.",1551,2022,1681,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-09-25 09:20:08.969 +0200,2023-02-03 11:04:28.744 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1524,The Church of the Holy Sepulchre,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This church, located in the Christian quarter of the old city of Jerusalem (Israel), serves as the architectural monument commemorating the salvific events associated with the final days of Jesus’ life. Consecrated in 335, and renovated repeatedly over the centuries, the church encompasses the traditional locations of Christ’s crucifixion as well as his burial and subsequent resurrection. 

Its building was part of a broader building programme, instituted by Emperor Constantine (d.377) which saw the construction of a number of Christian churches in key sacred locations in Palestine. In its earliest form, it comprised two separate structures: the Rotunda, a circular building enclosing a smaller monument known as the Aedicule, and the Basilica of Constantine which stood to the East. The church however suffered numerous destructions which altered its fabric. Chief amongst these was its destruction in 1009 on orders of Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim (985-1021) which led to its reconstruction initially during the 11th century, but in the main during the period of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099-1291). The building’s current form is mainly the result of this reconstruction, completed in the Gothic style between the 1140s and the 1160s, though it has been subject to numerous, significant repairs since that date.

The Rotunda remains the main part of the church and encloses the most sacred element of the structure. The Aedicule, a smaller monument contained with the Rotunda and rebuilt in 1555, was constructed over a 1st century CE rock-cut tomb, dug away from original quarry which it seems to have been a part. The empty tomb is believed to be that of Christ and is venerated by many Christian denominations as the location of Christ’s resurrection from the dead. The south of the Church contains a chapel, reached by a series of steps, commemorating the place of Calvary or Golgotha, and thus the site of Christ’s crucifixion. This chapel in turn sits atop further chapel in which the rock of Golgotha can be see (sometimes recognised as the burial place of Adam). To the east of the Church, surrounding the choir, are a series of other chapels, including the Prison of Christ, the Chapel of Flagellation, the Chapel of Crowning with Thorns, and the subterranean chapel of St Helena which commemorates the site where the Empress Helena (d.330) miraculously discovered the resting place of the True Cross. All these locations play a significant role in historical and contemporary commemorations of Christ’s passion and resurrection. 

In recent times, the Church has undergone major renovation works, particularly during the period of the British Mandate (1918-1948) and since the 1960s, though this latest phase was completed in 2017. Today it is held in reverence by many of Christianity’s denominations. It is controlled jointly by groups representing the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, Coptic, Syrian, and Ethiopian churches whose ownership is managed through an agreement known as the Status Quo which gives each groups certain rights over different parts of the building. It is widely considered Christianity’s most sacred place.",335,2022,1687,1206,Philip Booth,2022-09-28 15:40:37.688 +0200,2022-12-02 17:02:59.624 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1525,Changsha Zidanku Chu bo shu 長沙子彈庫楚帛書 1 (Chu Silk Manuscript),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zidanku Silk Manuscript 1, also known as the Chu Silk Manuscript from Zidanku in Changsha (Changsha Zidanku Chu bo shu 長沙子彈庫楚帛書), and commonly referred to as the Chu bo shu 楚帛書 (Chu silk manuscript), is a silk manuscript (47 cm long and 38 cm wide) unearthed by robbers in 1942 from a Warring States tomb in Zidanku, southeast of the former city walls of Changsha. The tomb has been dated by archaeologists as having been closed around 300 BCE. The manuscript, which contains a brief cosmogonic account, is mainly concerned with astronomical and astrological content and is deemed to have been used in divination practice. The Chu bo shu has been buried together with at least two other silk manuscripts, and these three texts represent the only silk manuscripts from Warring States China that have been discovered to date. After having been stolen, the Chu bo shu has been first acquired by an art collector called Cai Jixiang 蔡季襄 (1897–1980). In 1945, he personally published the first examination of the manuscript. Subsequently, the manuscript has been transferred to the United States of America and is now stored at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C. The most distinctive feature of this manuscript is that it consists of both text and illustrations. The central part of the silk cloth displays two main texts, that are arranged in opposite directions. These two central texts are surrounded by twelve zoomorphic figures pictured in the peripheral area of the cloth, each of which is accompanied by a brief text. Each figure (with its respective short text) corresponds to one of the twelve months of the year. The three months making up each season are oriented toward a particular direction and each side of the cloth represents a season. There are four colored trees, each drawn in one of the four angles of the cloth. Due to exposure to light, folds, and worn edges, the Chu bo shu is unreadable in several spots. Nevertheless, the division into three main sections is clearly noticeable. Each of the three sections is concerned with some aspects of the lunisolar calendar: the longer one in the central section of the cloth is focused on the year; the shorter one in the central section, with the seasons; the short captions which accompany the twelve figures ringed around the main texts, with the twelve months. The main interest of the author of the Chu bo shu seems to be to avoid catastrophic events by having the calendar used with proper respect and knowledge. The three sections of the Chu bo shu: - The short text: the main subjects of the inner short text are the seasons. This section displays cosmogonical mythologies dealing with gods and with the establishment of natural order, based on the proceeding of the sun, the moon, and the seasons. - The long text: the main subject of the inner long text is sui 歲 (year). This section focuses on the possibility of disrupting the established natural order accounted for in the seasons' section of the manuscript. The main concern is the danger subsequent to a possible disruption of this order and therefore the importance attached to the knowledge and the understanding of the year for the purpose of avoiding this risk. The knowledge of the year is based on the observation of the proceeding of the celestial bodies, and in particular of the sun and the moon. - The twelve short texts: twelve hemerological captions which accompany the same number of zoomorphic figures, understood as gods associated with the twelve months. Each of the twelve texts presents the name of the lunar month (or its spirit), followed by a two-character definition of its functions, and a brief paragraph in which it is stated whether certain actions are permissible or not in a given month, in the guise of the monthly ordinances that we find in the Lüshi Chunqiu 呂氏春秋. The longer text written in the center of the silk cloth is positioned with the three winter months on top, spring months on the right, summer months below, and autumn months on the left, with the shorter text (also written in the middle of the cloth) arranged upside-down on its side. The manuscript’s layout suggests that it is purposely cardinally oriented and probably conceived in such a way to be rotated during its reading and use. The fact that the layout of the Chu bo shu requires its reader or user to rotate it (or to circle around it) suggests that it is related to divination practices. In fact, this mechanism of rotation, together with the concern with the motion of the celestial bodies and the flowing of time, is reminiscent of the function and the working of a divination object known as the shi 式 (cosmograph or diviner’s board), in which a round disk (that represents the sky) rotates upon a square base (that represents the earth).",-400,-300,1688,1195,Francesca Puglia,2022-09-30 19:01:22.518 +0200,2022-10-03 10:58:42.740 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1526,Pashupati-Kshetra (The Area of Pashupati),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Pashupati-kshetra is a roughly one square mile of demarcated area of religious significance mainly to Hindus (but also containing some sites important to Buddhists) located roughly five kilometers to the east of the historical center of Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal. Situated in the central part of this religious area is a two-tiered, three-storied pagoda-style temple of Pashupatinath, an aspect of the Hindu god Shiva. The Sanskrit-derived phrase ‘Pashupati-kshetra’ translates into ‘The Area of Pashupati’, meaning the concerned area is land belonging to the deity Shiva. The Area comprises the Pashupatinath temple; shrines dedicated to other deities built in the area; and the settlement of Deopatan, a village traditionally inhabited by Newar caste groups that perform ritual duties at the Pashupatinath temple and the surrounding shrines. The Pashupati Area is today managed by the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), a legally mandated government body that was established in 1987 CE. The Trust not only manages the day-to-day administration of the Pashupatinath temple and the Pashupati Area but also carries out development projects for improving service delivery to pilgrims and tourists. ●




The temple of Pashupatinath is of great political importance to the Nepalese state as the deity has served as the spiritual protector to all the ruling dynasties for the past fifteen hundred years. The origin myth of the temple takes us further back into pre-historical times and the deity already features as an important spiritual personage and the temple, as a prominent landmark, on the earliest royal stone edicts from the Licchavi Period belonging to the first half of the first millennium CE. Given the enormous historical and political importance of this place, it has always been the focus of political interest, patronage and reverence. Political interest shown by the state and political players continues even after the end of monarchy in 2008 CE. ●



In the sacred landscape of the Pashupati Area, in addition to the temple of Pashupatinath, can be found temples and shrines dedicated to the Hindu Mother Goddesses reverential to practitioners of Shaivite/Tantric traditions. In addition, many different shrines and temples dedicated to other Hindu deities and built during different historical periods form a rich and complex religious topography. Almost all of these monuments are located in the area designated by the Pashupati Area Development Trust as the Protected Monument Zone. Beyond this core zone in the northern end of the Area, a number of historically important Buddhist monasteries and chaityas can be found. All in all, there are 700 or more ‘sacred sites’, including temples, shrines, monuments, statues, etc. to be found within the Pashupati-kshetra today (Michaels and Tandon 2017).",533,2022,1689,1180,Ajaya Mali,2022-10-01 02:51:03.382 +0200,2022-11-25 10:38:20.259 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1527,"Masjid Al-Aqsha Menara Kudus, Kudus (Central Java)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Kudus—also known as Ja’far Shadiq (d. 1550)—is widely considered one of the Nine Saints (Wali Songo) who are widely believed to have contributed to the indigenization of Islam on the island of Java. He was the son of Sunan Ngudung who officiated as the Imam of the Grand Mosque of Demak during the reign of Sultan Trenggana.  Sunan Kudus was the fifth imam at the Grand Mosque of Demak and built the Masjid al-Aqsha Menara Kudus (popularly known as Menara Kudus) in 1549. Menara Kudus is named after the Jami al-Aqsha mosque at al-Quds (the Arabic name for Jerusalem). As a strict disciplinarian, Sunan Kudus wished to extirpate pantheistic heresy. To this end, he burnt Siti Jenar (also known as seh Lemah Abang), a heterodox Sufi mystic and his disciple, the ruler of Pengging. Sunan Kudus’ dakwah (act of inviting people to embrace Islam) consisted of the extensive deployment  of wayang klitik (the flat wooden puppet) to convey Islamic themes. During the first quarter of the sixteenth century, as majority of the population of Kudus was Hindu and regarded cow as a sacred animal, the saint issued a fatwa (a religious decree) that proscribed cow slaughter on Idul Adha. The architecture of Menara Kudus reveals the acculturation between Islamic and Javanese architectural elements. Resembling an ancient Javanese shrine or a Candi, the minaret is similar to a Majapahit-era temple.",1549,2022,1690,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-10-01 08:50:18.955 +0200,2023-02-06 19:56:34.704 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1528,Najran,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"South Arabia was unified under the kingdom of Ḥimyar around 275 CE, after subjugating the nearby kingdoms of Saba’ and Ḥaḍramawt. The king of Ḥimyar Malkīkarib Yuha’min (reigned from about 375 to 400) converted to monotheism around 380. Two religious communities are in South Arabia during the fourth and fifth centuries. A local Jewish community influenced the ruling elites, which adopted a cautious form of monotheism which could be defined as “Jewish sympathizing”. In addition to the presence of several Hebrew and Aramiac loanwords in Ḥimyarite inscriptions, two Hebrew inscriptions have been found in South Arabia and a group of epitaphs found outside South Arabia has been attributed to Jewish Himryarite emigrants. The Ḥimyarite kings’ choice to adopt a monotheism inspired by Judaism potentially had political implications, distancing Ḥimyar from Christian political entities, such as Rome, Aksūm, and the surrounding federations of Arabia. Two centuries after the unification, Christianity spread in South Arabia from Najrān, an oasis located at the intersection of the trade route between South Arabia and North-Western Arabia. While one literary account attributes the spread of Christianity in Najrān to a priest by the name of ʾAzqir, active at the time of king Shurihḅʾīl Yakkuf (ca. 468–80), others attributes it to a trader named Ḥannān or Ḥayyān who had converted at Ḥīrah, in modern Iraq. Another literary account attributes the Himyarite’s conversion to Christianity to the preachings of the ascetics Paul and John. This hagiography was probably the basis of the narrative by the Yemeni Wahb ibn Munabbih (d. 728/32) reported by the Muslim historians Ibn Isḥāq and al-Ṭabarī. Both authors claim that two Christians, named Faymiyūn and Ṣālih, were sold as enslaved people in Najrān, where people venerate palm trees. When Faymiyūn proved the truthfulness of the Christian God, the  oasis converted to Christianity. Around 523, the Jews of Ḥimyar, sponsored by the king, and the rising community of Christians of South Arabia entered into conflict when the Jewish South Arabian king by the name of Joseph killed the Christian population of Najrān. Kāleb, the Christian king of Aksūm (located between north Ethiopia and south Eritrea) led an expedition to South Arabia and killed Joseph in 525. Thereafter, a Christian kingdom was established in the region until its fall in 575. Kaleb is regarded as a defender of the Miaphysite faction and a saint for the universal church. The kingdom of South Arabia collapsed in the second half of the sixth century.",500,575,1691,1109,Valentina A.

1529,Byzantine Iconoclasts (726-787 CE),43,Religious Group (v6),"Byzantine iconoclasts (image breakers) were not always a homogenized group, but we now use the term to represent the interlocutors who codified the social, political, and religious conflict with iconophiles (lovers of images) into law. The first period of Iconoclasm (image breaking) in Byzantium is usually attributed to the 720s CE. Textual sources report that a prominent icon (portrait) of Christ was removed from public view in Constantinople in 726. This led to subsequent debates over whether and how it was appropriate to depict holy figures in art. The controversy oscillated until a church council in 754 forbade the use of icons, a mandate that lasted until 787. 

The process of iconomachy (image struggle) emerged alongside Christianity in late antiquity. As the religion spread from its origins in Jerusalem toward Rome, Constantinople, and nearby regions, practitioners of the new religion developed a visual vocabulary and artistic practices. By the sixth century, Christian icons depicting holy figures and narratives were used in churches and on domestic items. Christians also venerated holy relics, the material remains of holy people who had died and were thought to be heavenly intercessors for the living. Christians differentiated their use of icons and relics from the use of pagan idols by interpreting holy images as providing access to the divine. Periods of Byzantine iconomachy occurred because there were Christians who, for various reasons, had an aversion to figural religious images.

A gathering of bishops at the Quinisext Council in 691-692 attempted to codify the respectful use of religious images. For example, they insisted on depicting Christ as a man rather than symbolically as a lamb. The council’s careful attention to image use points to the emerging controversy among Orthodox Christians about whether and how it was appropriate to depict holy figures in material icons. 

In contrast to the visual culture of iconophiles, iconoclasts argued that earthly matter was inadequate for depicting the divine. Some took the biblical second commandment forbidding the worship of idols (Exodus 20:4-5) as a mandate against use of religious images that could be construed as idolatry. This was in keeping with existing Jewish practices in late antiquity. Many others, including Monophysite Christians in eastern provinces, preferred aniconic (non-figural) images or symbolic representations of Christ such as a cross or the celebration of the Eucharist (bread and wine commemorating Christ’s sacrifice and resurrection). 

Some sources attribute the spread of iconomachy to increasing familiarity with aniconic Muslim practice, which criticized the Christian use of figural imagery. Byzantines knew these beliefs primarily through military encounters during the Islamic conquests by the seventh century. 

Iconoclasm as imperial policy is often associated with Emperor Leo III (r. 717-741), who had risen to power through a military career. He was credited with the removal of the Christ icon from the Chalke Gate, a prominent entrance to the imperial palace in 726. Another event during his reign was the dismissal of iconophile Germanos I from his position as Patriarch of Constantinople in 730. It is important to note, however, that Leo’s iconoclastic tendencies were only recorded in texts written by later iconophiles.

Leo’s son and successor, Constantine V (r. 741-775), was a documented iconoclast. In 754 he called a church synod (assembly of bishops) that forbade the creation of holy portraits in material form. The synod also rejected the use of icon veneration in domestic, personal settings, although it made a point to honor Christ as well as the Virgin and saints through aniconic means. 

Notably, the effects of iconomachy were primarily in Constantinople. It is not clear whether many images were actually destroyed due to the ban or how stringently the ban was implemented outside the capital. It is possible that the controversy was primarily a philosophical and legal debate rather than a period of widespread material destruction of existing icons. 

The first period of Byzantine Iconoclasm ended with the Iconophile Interlude (787-802). Empress Irene (regent from 780-797) called a new church council that ruled in favor of religious portraits in 787, saying that the honor paid to the image is transferred to its holy prototype. The Iconophile interlude was followed by a second period of Iconoclasm from 815-842. The debates were at the heart of a long struggle during which Orthodox Christians in the Byzantine Empire and beyond were forced to articulate acceptable image use within the context of theology and politics.",720,743,13,1213,A.L.

1532,"The Mausoleum of Sunan Gunung Jati, Cirebon (West Java)",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sunan Gunung Jati (d. 1570)—known variously as Syarif Hidayatullah, Falatehan and Tugril— is credited with the Islamization of western Java and regarded as one of the members of the Wali Songo. The Wali Songo refers to the nine founders of Islam on the island of Java during the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. Sunan Gunung Jati was the ancestor of the Muslim ruling families of Cirebon and Banten respectively. Historians lack definitive details regarding the genealogy of the saint. Nevertheless, it is plausible that Sunan Gunung Jati was a native of Pasai (Aceh) and undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca. At Mecca, the saint is said to have studied under Najmuddin al-Kubra who subsequently initiated him into the Naqshbandiyya tarekat (an order of Sufism). In the West Javanese Babad Tjirebon chronicle, Kubra is represented not only as the ancestor and preceptor of Sunan Gunung Jati but also of the Wali Songo saints namely Sunan Ampel and Sunan Bonang. Both genealogical and teacher-student relationships establish connection among these figures. The saint’s dakwah (act of calling people to embrace Islam) strategy consisted of not only teaching Islam to the local inhabitants of Mount Sembung but strengthening relationships with influential figures in the Cirebon principality through matrimonial alliances. The Cirebon principality was a vassal of the Hindu Pakuan Pajajaran kingdom of western Java, ruled by Prabu Siliwangi. But on becoming Cirebon’s tumenggung (leader), the saint refused to pay tribute to Pajajaran. In the confrontation between Sunan Gunung Jati and Pajajaran, the latter was defeated. Subsequently, Tumenggung Jagabaya, the military general of Pajajaran kingdom and sixty soldiers embraced Islam. Sunan Gunung Jati is considered as the first Sultan of Cirebon and is said to have divided Pajajaran into three parts: entrusting Banten and Cirebon to his sons whilst Pajajaran was entrusted to his uncle. The mausoleum complex of Sunan Gunung Jati is spread across Bukit Sembang and Bukit Gunung Jati hills in northeastern Cirebon, West Java. Bukit Gunung Jati was considered sacred in pre-Islamic times. According to Sundanese folklore, a massive fire was sometimes lit at the peak of Gunung Jati and was considered the embodiment of nature’s navel. The gravesite of Sunan Gunung Jati represents the assimilation of pre-Islamic Hindu, Buddhist and Sunda Wiwitan (an indigenous folk religion of the Baduy, Bantenese, Cirebonese and Sundanese people of western Java) within the framework of Islam.",1570,2022,1694,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,2022-10-05 11:24:27.136 +0200,2023-02-03 14:24:03.000 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1534,Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra

The Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra (The Amitābha  Sutra; 佛說阿彌陀經; T12, 366) is one of the most fundamental texts for Pure Land Buddhism. It depicts the Sukhāvatī, the wonderous Pure Land of Amitābha, and lists the salvific benefits of being reborn there. Together with the Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra (Infinite Life Sutra; 佛說無量壽經) and the Amitāyus Contemplation Sūtra (Sutra on the Contemplation of the Buddha Immeasurable Life; 佛說觀無量壽經), three sutras constitute the textual pillar of Pure Land Buddhism in East Asia. 
The sutra starts at the Śākyamuni Buddha’s preaching at Jetavana Vihāra, Śrāvastī, to his major disciples and numerous Boddhisattvas. The Buddha introduces Sukhāvatī, the Amitābha’s distant pure land of ultimate bliss. In his Western Pure Land, all objects—the land, architecture, adornments, and living beings—are the manifestation of the Dharma. Those who are reborn in Sukhāvatī do not even know the ideas of ""evil"" and ""suffering."" The three lower realms of rebirth (animal, hungry ghost, hell) do not exist. Those who are reborn there automatically gain salvific progress from hearing the miraculous and dharmic sounds of its heavenly beings. The Buddha then explains the meanings of the name “Amitayus”/“Amitābha” as the Buddha of immeasurable lifespan and immeasurable light.
The Pure Land rebirth requires the person to hear the name of Amitābha and hold this name in mind for seven days, without any disturbance. If at the moment of death, one remains mentally undisturbed, Amitābha and his assemblies will appear to facilitate the person to be reborn in the Pure Land. Then, the sutra moves to the confirmation sections. The sutra offers the praises and endorsements of the Amitābha Buddha by all other Buddhas. It proclaims the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas from the six directions all affirm the inconceivable qualities of Sukhāvatī and exhort the listeners to seek rebirth there. Finally, the sutra emphasizes the importance of faith and bodhisattva vows. The Bodhisattva Vows made by the realized Buddhas, including Amitābha, are the core tenet that affirms the efficacy of Pure Land practices. And compared to all other practices in the Saha World, the Pure Land belief in Amitābha is the most accessible and easy one.
In contrast to other Pure Land sutras, the Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra does not contain the specific forty-eight Bodhisattva vows made by the then Dharmākara Bodhisattva, including to create a field with inconceivable wondrous qualities and who collects the mind to the Amitābha Buddha ten times will be reborn in his land (except who violated five deadly precepts). Based on scholastic commentaries, the path of Pure Land is the “easy path.” In Japan, the power of Amitābha is further labeled as the Tariki (the Power of the Other).
Philologically speaking, the origin of the Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra is still a mystery. The earliest Sanskrit copy was discovered in the Gandhāra region, northern India, and probably composed in the first century CE. Presumably the sutra, as part of the Mahāyāna repertoire, was popular in pre-Islamic Central Asia. The Sanskrit edition was first translated by Max Müller and his cohorts in 1875. It was translated again by Luis O. Gomez in 1996. 
Since its translation into Chinese, the sutra gradually became the most fundamental text in East Asia. The first Chinese translation was by Kumārajīva in 402. It was subsequently translated again by Guṇabhadra from 454-456 and by Xuanzang in 650. The text was also translated into Tibetan from the ninth century onward.
The sutra received extensive commentaries from East Asia monastics. In China, nianfo (being Mindful of the Buddha) became a diffused Buddhist practice that was adopted by many indigenous traditions. In Japan, monastics who favored the text formed Jōdo shū, Jōdo Shinshū, and Nichiren.",100,2022,1722,727,Guanxiong Qi,2022-10-07 11:56:45.528 +0200,2023-01-03 15:42:39.674 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1540,The Sanskrit Yasna,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Yasna is the Zoroastrian long liturgy. Originally composed in Avestan, it was then translated into Pahlavi and some comments to the text were added. Then, the text was brought to India by the Parsi community and, presumably between the 12th and the 14th century, further translated into Sanskrit. The Sanskrit text includes many layers, namely a proper translation of the original text of the Yasna, based however on the Pahlavi version, with occasional direct reference to the original Avestan text; the translation into Sanskrit of some Pahlavi comments to the text; original Sanskrit comments, added to explain further the Zoroastrian concepts and adapt them to the Indian sociocultural environment. Finally, a few Sanskrit ritual instructions were added to the text.
The Sanskrit version has never had a ritual value, but it is in any case interesting from a religious point of view. In fact, the significant terms of the Zoroastrian cult are rendered with meaningful terms belonging to other religious traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and, above all, Jainism. The Jaina environment of Gujarat has deeply influenced the Sanskrit version of the Yasna: for instance, the script, the so-called Parsi Nāgarī, is very close to the Jaina Nāgarī; the palaeography is close to the Jaina one, too; the text includes graphical elements which recalls the ones present in Jaina manuscripts, etc. 

A systematic translation project is recognisable behind the Sanskrit text, whose compilation was influenced by both Indian regional features and the Zoroastrian tradition. In the translation process, the passage from one language to the other implies the adaptation of all the formal and semantic aspects of terms and expressions. In this case, the passage went through two steps, first from Avestan to Pahlavi and then from Pahlavi to Sanskrit. The translators into Sanskrit were philologists ante litteram, who carried out a refined work of Indo-Iranian comparative philology. 

Finally, the geographical settlement of the Parsi community in (north-)western India, a land which has always been characterised by religious and cultural syncretism, has for sure encouraged such kind of refined study and comment to the text. 

There are still many open questions and the reason of the translation into Sanskrit is not clear, since the Parsi ritual language has always been Avestan and their mother tongue Gujarati. Were they trying to reach out other Indian communities and promote themselves at court? Were they providing a well-known Indian format to the Parsi community itself? The Sanskrit text of the Yasna is therefore not useful on a ritual level, but it may be extremely meaningful to throw light on the socio-cultural context of its compilation.",1100,1400,677,1119,Martina Palladino,2022-10-11 18:13:00.395 +0200,2023-01-01 20:04:53.587 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1543,St. George's Cathedral,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"St. George's Cathedral in Ukraine has served as many things in the 20th century alone: the seat of the Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the religiously diverse city of Habsburg Lemberg, the temporary headquarters of the Nazi-occupying regime in western Ukraine, and under the Soviets, a Russian Orthodox Church whose purpose was to promote Orthodoxy in a historically Catholic land. In the 1990s, it was the site of protests against the Soviet state, protests that called for this Church to once again serve the Greek Catholic Church and for Ukraine to not only have religious freedom, but also to be independent from the Soviet Union. A particular example of baroque Church architecture, the church in its current form was designed by the architect Bernard Meretyn (d. 1758) who combined elements of 18th century Habsburg architecture with his own interpretations of local Ukrainian churches. The Church architecture also reflects the hybrid nature of the Greek Catholic Church, with elements drawn from Latin-rite and Eastern-rite Christianity. 

St. George’s Cathedral was built as a joint venture between the Metropolitan of the Church, Metropolitan Atanasii Sheptytsky, and Habsburg patrons. The Catholic Habsburg monarchy was invested in raising the status of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the lands it had recently annexed from Poland. Raising the status of the Greek Catholic Church was thought to be an effective strategy to fight influence from imperial Russia and its Russian Orthodox Church as well as to create loyal Habsburg status out of Greek Catholics. This campaign of support for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church resulted in a growth in Greek Catholic seminaries and the construction of new Church buildings, including St. George’s. The Church’s Baroque style was crafted with the assistance of prominent European architects and its artistic elements, particularly its sculptures of saints and Church Fathers, reflect the architectural style of the day.  

Situated on a hill, the Church remains an architectural symbol of the city of L'viv, today located in Ukraine and a testament to the city’s character as a European city. Yet for powers that have occupied the city of L’viv throughout history, the symbolic importance of St. George’s and it sacred nature have made it a target for forcible occupation. During the Nazi occupation of L’viv (1939-1944), Nazi authorities used Church buildings to create their occupying regime and coordinated religious ceremonies to create the (false) narrative that Nazi power had the Church’s blessing. When western Ukraine was occupied by Soviet authorities, officially becoming part of Soviet Ukraine in 1945, St. George’s Cathedral was forcibly transferred to the jurisdiction of the Soviet state-sponsored Russian Orthodox Church, a powerful symbol of the USSR’s promotion of Russian Orthodoxy and suppression of the Greek Catholic Church in western Ukraine. Today, the Church is once again a Greek Catholic Church and while the seat of the Church is now in Kyiv, the powerful arch-eparchy of L’viv is represented by St. George’s.",1700,2000,1802,1110,Kathryn David,2022-10-17 17:44:24.935 +0200,2022-12-02 17:25:39.212 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1544,Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is both a minority faith in Ukraine yet also a Church that has exerted a great deal of influence on Ukrainian culture and politics throughout the 19th and 20th centuries until today. While most Ukrainians identify as Orthodox, in the regions of western Ukraine it was the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church that historically served as the religious affiliation for the Ukrainian-speaking population. Created as a hybrid Church through a church union (the 1596 Union of Brest) as a way to absorb Orthodox Slavs into Catholic jurisdictions in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, this religious institution remained an influential force in the territories of present-day western Ukraine as empires rose and fell in eastern Europe. The Church endured as its parishes became part of Habsburg Austria-Hungary, interwar Poland, and even under Nazi occupation. This endurance is credited to one of the most influential leaders of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who served as Metropolitan from 1900-1944. Under his tenure, the Church sought to create a path for itself as both a religious institution and a Ukrainian cultural institution. Metropolitan Sheptytsky’s death coincided with the imposition of Soviet power in western Ukraine in 1944. Over the course of this history, the rituals and beliefs of Ukrainian Greek Catholics were deeply influenced by the more powerful religious institutions surrounding it, the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church. The Church endured campaigns of forced transfer to Russian Orthodoxy in territories conquered by imperial Russia and in territories ruled by Catholic monarchies, forced latinizations of its rituals. In the aftermath of the Second World War and the Sovietization of western Ukraine, the Soviet state did not simply ban the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, but embarked on a religious campaign that resembled that of its imperial predecessors, forcing its three million Ukrainian Greek Catholics to join the state-sponsored Russian Orthodox Church. Some accepted Orthodoxy, others simply pretended to accept Orthodoxy, while others maintained the practices of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the underground. Through these experiences, the Church developed its own particular liturgical practices and rituals that reflected its interpretations of what a church union between Orthodoxy and Catholicism meant in practice. These practices reflect a complex negotiation of religious influences imposed by force, as well as influences welcomed into the Church through natural processes of cultural exchange. Because of its hybrid nature, the Church also became a religious institution that tolerated a great deal of variation among rituals between its parishes. In practice this means that while Church institutions have taken formal positions on the correct interpretation of variances between the Byzantine and Latin-rite, variances that include the sacrament of the Eucharist and the filioque, different parishes will follow different customs based on their particular histories and the practices and traditions most familiar to local parishioners. The Church's recent history has been shaped by its role in independent Ukraine. As the Soviet Union began to collapse in the early 1990s, the Church was permitted to emerge from the underground and its activists became instrumental in the movement for Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. In recent decades, the Vatican has attempted to codify the rituals and practices of Eastern churches like the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church as part of a project of recognizing the contributions of these unique spiritual cultures, rather than seeing them as aberrations that need to be “latinized.” Today, the Church's endurance is seen as tied up with the endurance of the Ukrainian nation itself, even though that nation is primarily Orthodox. As an institution, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church maintains an intensive involvement in Ukrainian society through its network of educational institutions, charitable endeavors, and military chaplaincy, involvement which influences Ukrainians of all faith traditions.",1596,2022,331,1110,Kathryn David,2022-10-17 17:51:16.716 +0200,2022-12-02 00:08:01.710 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1545,Synagogue at Gamla,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Gamla (or Gamala) was a town located in ancient Gaulanitis (modern Golan Heights). The name perhaps derives from shape of the hill the town lies upon, shaped like a camel's hump. The town flourished during the 1st century BCE in part thanks to a thriving olive oil industry. During the First Jewish War against Rome, the town was besieged by Vespasian and ultimately destroyed. 
The synagogue structure was first identified in the late 1970s. The building consisted over a large main hall, with some additional rooms on the front and rear of the structure. There are two levels in the main hall, separated by stepped benches that circuit the central floor. There are additional rooms adjacent to this main hall.
The original structure may have been built during the 1st century BCE, but either some reconfiguration took place around the beginning of the 1st century CE, or the structure was only constructed at this point. Additional rooms were added onto the structure at a later date. The total size of the building, after all additional rooms were added, was around 25 by 17 metres. As such, the Gamla synagogue is the largest known Second Temple period synagogue.
The synagogue is not attested to in any ancient text, and there are no inscriptions which provide any more information. The only decorative elements from the structure are a lintel stone, which bears a rosette. The inner columns were likely topped with doric capitals. A single, but poorly carved, ionic style capital was also found inside the hall.
The users of the structure are difficult to identify. The structure is well built, but perhaps could seat between 400 and 540 people, only 10% of the town's total population (drawn from Spigel, Ancient Synagogue Seating, 2012). As such it is likely that during its regular use, it was used by local elites.
Outside the synagogue is a ritual immersion pool (miqveh). Such pools were used by Jews to cleanse themselves from ritual impurity. The pool was fed by a channel, which ran through the synagogue itself, suggesting that the pool was somehow linked with the synagogue, but it is difficult to determine the exact reason. 
During the revolt period, it appears that refugees sheltered in the structure, and in this period, we can suggest that the building was given over to non-elites. Once Gamla was besieged and fell to the Romans, the site was not reoccupied.

1546,"4QPseudo Ezekiel",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Words of Ezekiel (WoEzek) or Pseudo-Ezekiel are the designated names to a group of manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. The composition which was not known prior to its discovery in Qumran is commonly associated with the prophet Ezekiel and his oracles. WoEzek was preserved in at least three fragmentary parchment copies, sharing an overlapping textual section: 4Q385, 4Q386 and 4Q388. Two additional sigla numbers are associated with the composition: 4Q385b which contains a single fragment, and the papyrus scroll 4Q391. These manuscripts do not share any textual parallels with the scrolls stated above, yet 4Q385b and 4Q391 are identified as additional copies of WoEzek based on their rewriting style of the scriptural text of Ezekiel. The earliest manuscript, 4Q391 is dated to 150-100 BCE, while the other scrolls are roughly dated to 50-25 BCE. Although the composition was found in Qumran, its content does not show any special connection to the religious movement settled at the site (the Yahad), and thus it could have originated among different social groups in the Second Temple period. The composition contains a series of visions revealed to the prophet Ezekiel. Some of the preserved oracles also appear in the biblical (or the scriptural) versions of the Book of Ezekiel known today, such as the vision of the dry bones (Ezek 37) or the merkavah (chariot) vision (Ezek 1 and 10). Other sections are not known from any textual witnesses of scriptural Ezekiel, and their context is rather the Jewish literary and ideological framework in the Second Temple period. WoEzek is often categorised as “pseudo-prophetic” text (Dimant, 2001), and “rewritten scripture” (Zahn, 2014). It means that the composition uses the voice of the prophet and rewrites the scriptural source by setting it in a new framework and putting it to a different use. While the fragmentary state of the composition makes it difficult to determine its context, the principal orientation of the text is most likely apocalyptic, as it often highlights the apocalyptic connotation which can be attributed to Ezekiel’s oracles. The text contains references to the “day of the lord” and suggests that the redemption reflected through the vision of the dry bones is promised exclusively to the righteous among Israel, whose reward will be an actual resurrection at the eschatological end of the current universe.",-150,-25,1753,1091,Anna Shirav,2022-10-19 13:14:57.361 +0200,2022-11-10 23:51:37.395 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1549,Slaying of Husayn Texts,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A series of succession crises followed the death of the Islamic Prophet Muḥammad. One such crisis took place in the year 680 CE. Those who favored Muḥammad’s bloodline believed ʿAlī’s eldest son Ḥasan (c. 625-670) to be the divinely appointed leader. Ḥasan capitulated to the Caliph Muʿāwiya in order to avoid bloodshed, but there seems to have been a tacit agreement that at Muʿāwiya’s death the leadership would return to the Prophet’s household.  Ḥasan predeceased Muʿāwiya, leaving Ḥusayn as the supposed successor, but on his deathbed Muʿāwiya transferred power to his own son Yazīd. Unlike his older brother, Ḥusayn was not content to trade deference for peace, and in the 61st year of the Islamic calendar Ḥusayn and a handful of his companions met Yazīd’s forces on the plains of Karbalāʾ on the banks of the Euphrates River in Iraq. The outcome of the “battle” was a foregone conclusion—according to traditional sources of this narrative Ḥusayn’s band of a hundred-odd men, women, and children was several orders of magnitude smaller than Yazīd’s army.  Virtually all who fought with Ḥusayn died in a massacre which has thence served as the definitive event for Shīʿite piety. From relatively soon after the battle Ḥusayn’s partisans have commemorated his martyrdom through a series of rituals, legends, and elegies which have grown increasingly elaborate through the centuries. This entry explores one type of pietistic commemoration—""maqtal al-Ḥusayn"" texts from the late-Abbasid period when Twelver Shīʿism was crystalizing. These texts were compiled by three Muslims: ʿAbdullāh Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (d. 1172); al-Jalīl Najm al-Dīn Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad ibn Jaʿfar ibn Habatallah ibn Namā al-Ḥillī (d. 1247 or 1252); and ʿAlī ibn Mūsā ibn Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad ibn Ṭāwūs (d. 1265).",1150,1250,1757,750,Tasi Perkins,2022-10-22 20:25:00.410 +0200,2022-11-23 16:32:58.113 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1550,Tzintzuntzan,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The pre-Hispanic city of Tzintzuntzan, on the shores of Lake Patzcuaro, was the capital of the Señorío Tarasco, an important pre-Hispanic empire that was a fierce rival of the Mexica, and dominated a vast territory of western Mexico of more than 75,000 square kilometers, during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It was inhabited by the Señores Uacúsechas -Lord Eagles-, leaders of this señorío who ruled it through a hereditary dynasty. Tzintzuntzan functioned as its capital, ritual city, regional market and possessed a basic, ritual and elite craft production, containing the most important ritual spaces and being the royal residence of the ruler named calzonci (Pollard 2009: 242). The particularity of the conquest of Michoacán, which was agreed upon in its most important part, made this city a place where the Tarascan nobility coexisted with the Spanish conquerors for a good part of the 16th century in the old site of the city, gradually losing its importance during the 16th century to the neighboring Pátzcuaro. Thus, Tzintzuntzan is a unique place for the study of the transition from pre-Hispanic societies to those of the early colonial period, since, from being a pre-Hispanic capital and then a colonial city, it was quickly abandoned, leaving multiple archaeological remains on the hillsides that have not yet been fully studied.",1350,1522,1758,1217,José Luis Punzo Díaz,2022-10-23 20:58:46.228 +0200,2022-10-24 23:30:40.655 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1551,Donation Texts from Ur during the Isin-Larsa Period,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"At Ur, a range of documents called “donation texts” were unearthed. They are small tablets that registered quantities of semi-precious stones, silver and gold given to the temple of Ningal, the goddess protector of the city of Ur. The items were delivered by individual, including women. These documents belong to the archives of the unique religious complex of the city which included in its centre a ziggurat. The texts was excavated by Sir L. Woolley at Ur and are now preserved in the British Museum. I started to work on these texts during my doctoral dissertation and edited them in my book on the ornamentation of the gods in the Old Babylonian period (Maggio 2012). I take great interest in these documents because they are a rich source of information on worshipping practices, despite the difficulties that persist in the interpretation of certain cuneiform signs. These difficulties make us feel as though they are written at a turning point in Mesopotamian history. In this southern city, customs were changing. There was a tension between Sumerian traditions and the Akkadian traditions being introduced in the region. This tension implies some difficulties in the use of those two languages in the documentation. It is well established in this documentation that the objects belonging to the goddess Ningal and occasionally also to other deities were undoubtedly linked to her cult at Ur. Most probably, there were chapels dedicated to these deities in the temple of Ningal. The ornamental stone fragments were probably part of a larger piece of jewellery, such as necklace, but were torn off and dedicated to Ningal by their owners. From that moment on, they became the property of the temple and were used to adorn the goddess Ningal, and maybe other statues of lesser deities. In addition, one may wonder whether a particular area of the temple of Ningal itself was used for the storage of the goods, altough the available documentation does not mention it. Instead we know that the objects dedicated to the deities of the Ningal temple could be stored along with other materials in the nearby Ganunmaḫ.",-1970,-1850,1586,1261,Michèle Maggio,2022-10-24 11:42:12.250 +0200,2022-10-25 18:56:21.481 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1552,The Key of Ilme Kṣnum to Understand the Zoroastrian Religion,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"‘The key of Ilme Kṣnum to understand the Zoroastrian religion’ is the first book authored by Behramshah Naoroji Shroff (1858-1927), a Parsi gentleman from Surat, Gujarat (India). In 1906, Shroff made known Ilm-e-Khshnoom, an esoteric interpretation of Zoroastrianism, among the Parsis and spread its beliefs until his death. It is believed that he acquired such esoteric knowledge over three years, while he was staying with a community of Zoroastrian sages secluded in a village situated on Mount Damavand, in Iran. Ilm-e-Khshnoom offers a reconciliation between Persianate and Western systems of esoteric knowledge. ‘The Key of Ilme Kṣnum to Understand the Zoroastrian Religion’ is the first book published by Shroff and represents his only publication where the beliefs of Ilm-e-Khshnoom are systematically presented as a set of natural laws. In this regard, it is a fundamental text to further our understanding of Ilm-e-Khshnoom from a historical, cultural, sociological, and linguistic point of view. The following publications of Shroff, instead, focus on specific aspects of the Zoroastrian liturgy or of the Parsi life.
Being the first publication of Shroff as well as the first book on the subject of Ilm-e-Khshnoom, ‘The Key of Ilme Kṣnum to Understand the Zoroastrian Religion’ inaugurates the religious literature consisting of hundreds of books and articles, mainly composed in Gujarati. This knowledge production still continues nowadays, though English has become the main language used for publications.
Besides offering a thorough overview of the system of beliefs of Ilm-e-Khshnoom, one of the key features of this book is the presence of a large number of technical terms (also known in Gujarati as logato) whose genealogical study sheds light on the hermeneutical choices adopted by Shroff. Further, the dedication note and the foreword contain important elements that allow to ascribe the story of the initiation of Shroff and the relation with his masters to some narrative elements of the nationalist discourse of the 19th and 20th centuries-Iran. The textual analysis of this book, in effect, uncovers the cultural entanglements between the Persianate world, the Western sphere of influence, and India. The Parsis play a critical role in these entanglements, furthering connections and favouring cultural transfers; in particular, transculturation. Ilm-e-Khshnoom and ‘The Key of Ilme Kṣnum to Understand the Zoroastrian Religion’, in this regard, are the result of such entanglements and activities of transculturation between the Persianate, the West, and India.",1911,2022,1760,755,Mariano Errichiello,2022-10-24 19:12:06.947 +0200,2023-02-11 07:14:07.148 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1558,Acts of Paul and Thecla,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Acts of Paul and Thecla (APTh) is a popular second-century Christian text, with an entertaining tone and a message in favor of female chastity. It tells the story of Thecla, an elite virgin of the city of Iconium (in present-day Turkey) who overcomes severe persecution - through miracles, divine interventions, and a sturdy personality - to become an itinerant preacher and baptizer. The text once circulated independently but it’s now part of the larger collection of the Acts of Paul. It has clear narrative parallels with women’s stories in the other apocryphal acts.
In more detail, the story tells how Thecla converts to Christianity after hearing the words of the Apostle Paul in one of his itinerant preachings. She decides to leave her family behind to join Paul’s group, but her mother and her fiancéé search the authorities to denounce the apostle for corrupting female youth. As a result, Paul is banned from Iconium, and Thecla is condemned to death. Miracles happen while she’s in the arena - the beasts and the fire cannot hurt her and she baptizes herself in a pool full of seals. The authorities decide to release her and she finally receives approval from Paul to go around the world and teach the word of God. She travels to Seleucia and, according to one manuscript variation, lives as an ascetic teacher for 72 years in a cave in the desert.
The authorship of the text is uncertain. Scholars debate whether the story originates from oral legends or from a male writer. In De Baptismo (190 CE), the Church Father Tertullian presents it as a forgery from a male presbyter and reproaches those who had been using Thecla’s story as a justification for female leadership. 
With themes such as conversion, conflicts between the birth family and spiritual family, opposition to the Roman Empire, and gender relations, the APTh has been a popular text among Christians in Antiquity, the followers of the cult of Saint Thecla (still active today in Turkey) and scholars.
There are over forty primitive manuscripts of the APTh only in Greek, and also Latin, Syriac, Armenian and Slavonic versions. Modern scholars, however, have been cautious in considering it a reliable source for the historical reconstruction of Christian communities and women’s lives around the ancient Mediterranean.",150,200,1495,1136,Naiara Leão,2022-10-31 17:52:47.376 +0100,2022-12-02 00:20:43.487 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1559,Al-manhaj al-farîd fî ma'rifat 'ilm al-tawhîd.,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Al-manhaj al-farīd fī ma‘arifat ‘ilm al-tawḥīd (The peerless method to gain knowledge of theology) presents itself as a commentary on a canonical text on tawḥīd (muslim  theology), Al-‘aqīda al-Ṣughra (العقيدة الصغرة The small creed, also known as Umm al-barāhīn) by the north-African scholar Yūsuf al-Sanūsī (d. ca 1490). It is textbook originally meant to teach Islam, but it also reflects social developments in the time when Islam was spreading in Central Sudanic Africa.
The “commentary” grew out of other texts and was written down as The Peerless Method by Muḥammad al-Wālī ibn Sulaymān al-Fulānī al-Baghirmāwī al-Barnāwī  (محمد الوالي بن سليمان الفلاني البغرماوي البرناوي) in the second half of the seventeenth century.  
Its importance for Muslims in the region appears from the fact that it was often copied and 32 copies are still extant today. They are kept in libraries across West Africa, in Paris and in the Herskovits Library of Northwestern University, Evanston, Michigan.
Al-Wālī claims that his Peerless Method is the translation of a pre-existing comment by Fulani (Peul) scholars, and it is indeed clearly related to the Fulani tradition of the kabbe, which elaborated the Ṣughra into an oral “textbook” for the teaching of Islam to ordinary, and mostly illiterate believers. 
All-Sanūsī’s Ṣughra was popular almost as soon as it left the hands of its author. It was versified and commented on early in the sixteenth century and it has played a role in the spread of Islam from Africa to Indonesia. Essentially it is a scholastic work in which God’s attributes (صفات الله ) and those of the prophets are explained according to Aristotle’s categories of what is necessary  (God is eternal, for instance), what is impossible (that God would resemble temporal things, for instance) and what is possible (that God causes particular things, for instance). But it is also short and simple. It was meant to give believers more knowledge of a central (AshꜤari) doctrine of their religion.  
Moreover, the final lines of al-Sanūsī’s text take into account that intellect was not the only route to the knowledge of religious truth. Understanding could also be reached by methods of mysticism, in particular by internalising the knowledge represented by the words of the shahāda, the words with which Muslims testify that there is no god except God. Essentially, al-Sanūsī’s aim was the commitment to Islam of as many believers as possible. It was an inclusive goal. 
The same was true of the oral kabbe tradition. In texts that belong to this tradition the Ṣughra is reformulated to teach it to Muslims in West Africa. General information about the culture and the religion of Islam was added for new converts. The kabbe was taught in Fulfulde, the language of the Fulani ‘missionaries’. Kabbe versions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries continued to address a very broad audience of mainly illiterate believers. They, too, present their content as one of two equally important “fields” of religious knowledge—notably, knowledge about the manifest laws and principles, and knowledge about hidden truths, which could be obtained by following the path of the mystic. 
Al-Wālī’s Peerless Method  turns this inclusiveness of the Ṣughra and the kabbe completely around, in spite of the tight format of the commentary in which explanations are added to the original text line by line. It does this by hammering away at the idea that anyone who cannot reproduce the proofs of God’s oneness as they are presented in the PM and who can only parrot the words of shahāda without all this knowledge behind it, is an imitator, a muqallid ( مقلد ). 
This knowledge which the believer was supposed to memorise – not even in his mother tongue, but in fuṣḥa Arabic - was much more extensive than what the Ṣughra had laid out. It included for instance an explanation of the relation between God’s oneness and the creation of the world, according to MuꜤtazili philosophy. Saying that anyone who did not master such knowledge was an imitator, came down to saying that anyone who did not spend a lot of time with an Ꜥālim and submitted to his authority, was an imitator. Moreover, the PM repeats many times that the muqallid is an unbeliever. That was an unorthodox point of view, which did however also surface among groups of proselytizers towards the west, for instance in Sijilmasa. By giving the idea a place within the canonic tradition of the Ṣughra and the kabbe, al-Wālī made it salon-fähig. 
The popularity of the PM bears witness of a concern among many Muslims in al-Wālī’s environment with defining as clearly as possible who belonged and who did not belong to the Muslim community. A second concern it reveals is that with the position of the scholar. The role of scholars was under pressure by a trend in sufism that attached much importance to knowledge obtained by meditation or in dreams and played down the role of book-learning. Against this background, the PM presented the Ꜥulamā’s specialised knowledge as indispensable for the ordinary believer who did not want to be mistaken for an unbeliever. But the most important contribution al-Wālī made to support his colleagues was that he put the popular and authoritative text based on the oral kabbe in writing. By doing so he claimed it as “property” of  the religious scholars, whose trademark and monopoly was the craft of writing. And to write it, the Fulfulde text had to be translated into Arabic.",1650,1850,1772,1267,Dorrit van Dalen,2022-11-01 10:34:00.447 +0100,2022-11-08 23:51:53.905 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Written by the scholar and commentator Abu Ishaq at-Tha'labi, who died in 427 AH (1036 AD). Abu al-Qasim al-Qushayri said: I saw Almighty God in the dream, he was talking to me and I was talking to him, suddenly the Lord, his praise be to Him, said: behold the righteous man is coming towards us, so I turned around and saw Ahmed al-Tha'labi coming. Al-Thalabi's book is a group of collections that include a group of chapters. In each collection, al-Tha'labi tells the story of one of the prophets. The collection is similar to the Jewish midrash grouping. What brings al-Thalabi’s book closer to the Jewish midrash is that it seeks to clarify the lesson of every story, and that his book is very close to Jewish mythology.

1562,The Great Temple of Tenochtitlan,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Great Temple of Tenochtitlan was built by the Mexica (Aztecs) once they settled on an island (Tenochtitlan) in the Basin of Mexico during the Late Postclassic Period (1200-1521 CE). This temple was built to honor their patron deity, the sun and war god, Huitzilopochtli. This temple was placed at the center of the Mexica universe and religious cosmovision. It was rebuilt at least seven times during the several reigns of Mexica Emperors (""tlatoani""). It was approximately 47 m high and there were two shrines at the top, one dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and another to Tlaloc, the god of rain and earth's fertility. 

Since its discovery in 1978, the Templo Mayor Project team (PTM-INAH) have excavated this temple and its surroundings, uncovering over 200 sacred offerings filled with archaeological artifacts, ecofacts, and human remains. Each offering has its own meaning and representation in space and time (i.e., ""cosmograma"" in Spanish), depending on the type of ritual and the deity it was dedicated to. It's a very complex site with a lot more to find since part of it remains underneath the downtown core of present-day Mexico City making its excavation a challenge. All in all, this was the most sacred temple of the Mexica and everything revolved around this place as their most sacred precinct.",1325,1521,1773,1106,Diana Moreiras,2022-11-03 00:12:53.615 +0100,2022-12-10 06:14:16.150 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1563,Wumen Guan 無門關,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Wumen Guan 無門關 (the Gateless Barrier) is a gong’an (公案; Jp. koan) collection by Wumen Huikai 無門慧開 (1183–1260), a Song dynasty Linji 臨濟 monk. Originally, for pedagogical purposes, Wumen Huikai selected 48 cases from two anterior gong’an compilations, Biyan lu 碧巖錄 (The Record of Blue Cliff) by Yuanwu Keqin 圜悟克勤 (1063-1135) and Congrong lu 從容錄 (The Record of Equanimity) by Hongzhi Zhengjue 宏智正覺 (1091-1157). Huikai commentated and gave a gāthā to each case. After Huikai’s meditation instruction at the Longxiang Monastery in 1228, these 48 gong’an cases were complied together and named the Wumen Guan. 
The title, Wumen Guan, is a pun that serves two meanings. “Wumen"" is the name of the compiler, which literally means ""no gate"" or ""gateless."" In this context, “no gate” implies “impossibility” or “no way.” “Guan,” a rhetorical term in Chinese religions, refers to the barrier of enlightenment as well as the breakthrough point toward awakening. Thus, from a literal perspective, the title refers to “the Barrier of Wumen” or the ""Checkpoint of Wumen.” If we take “Wumen” as “gateless,” the collection is named “the Gateless Barrier,” “the Barrier that Has No Gate,” or “the Passage that Has No Way.”
From an emic perspective, the Linjin Chan tradition uses gong’an as expedient means to realize enlightenment. A gong’an is a short story, question, statement, or encounter dialogue of past Chan patriarchs, from the Sakyamuni Buddha to various Song lineage masters. These thematic stories are usually enigmatic and self-paradoxical. From a conventional perspective, many gong’an cases are absurd and non-sense. There are no standard answers to these gong’an cases, and giving official interpretations is regarded as taboo. 
Since the Song times, Chan Buddhists claimed Chan as a tradition of the secret mind-to-mind transmission that is devoid of verbal expression. The gong’an cases cannot be understood literally and straightforwardly, but need to be observed and comprehended by one’s mind. Although this image of Chan tradition, according to modern scholars, is deviated from the historical facts, the tropes of mind-to-mind, master-to-disciple transmission are deeply embedded in the Song dynasty Chan texts, including the Wumen Guan.
Accredit to Dahui Zonggao 大慧宗杲 (1089-1163), this method is referred to as Huatou Chan (話頭禪; Jp. Wato Zen). Facing the paradox, the practitioners need to raise and accumulate great doubt in the mind. As one pushes oneself to the brink of intellectual breakdown, one realizes great insights and enlightenment. 
Since its appearance, Wumen Guan received a great degree of popularity. However, there is no evidence that the text was massively promulgated and studied in China after Wumen Huikai’s death, as its extent in Japan. After its transmission to Japan, the text became one of the quintessential texts of the Rinzai Zen tradition. There are dozens of extant editions with different degrees of variations. Many prescripts and postscripts are added continuously by famous Buddhist masters and scholar-officials. Some editions contain a 49th case added by Wu’an 無庵. 
In modern times, Wumen Guan is one of the most significant and popular Buddhist texts. It has been repetitively translated into multiple European languages.",1228,2022,1774,727,Guanxiong Qi,2022-11-03 08:47:00.476 +0100,2023-01-09 17:25:56.054 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1564,Heng xian 恆先,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Heng Xian 恆先 (Before Constancy) is a looted bamboo manuscript acquired by the Shanghai Museum from the Hong Kong Antiquites Market in 1994. The manuscript has been dated by archaeologists around the 300 BCE and it is deemed as an original Chu 楚 state text. The text, consisting of 13 bamboo slips, has been reconstructed by scholars from a total of around 1200 bamboo slips acquired from the same market. The first edition of the text has been published in 2003 by the paleographer Li Ling 李零. Since then, the manuscript has been analyzed by many scholars, yet there is still no consensus among them regarding the arrangement of the slips. It is even possible that part of the original text is missing: in fact, some passages that are linguistically unusual or odd in content might be the result of an erroneous assembling of the slips. Most of the thirteen bamboo slips in the Shanghai Museum's possession are intact, yet some characters are corrupted and hardly legible, while some others can be possibly read in more than one way, posing further difficulties for the understanding of the text. The title “Heng Xian” appears on the back of the third slip with the writing 㔰, the ancient form for 恆. The character heng 恆, as defined in the Shuowen Jiezi 說文解字, means “constancy” (恆，常也), originally related to the constancy of lunar phases (Shuowen Jiezi on 㔰: 古文恆, 从月). The phrasing Heng xian 恆先, as it emerges from the text, appears to indicate a state of emptiness and stillness preceding the constancy that characterizes the workings of nature. Along the lines of this understanding of the manuscript, Sixin Ding equates the concept of Heng with the tiandao 天道 (Way of Heaven). The text can be summarily divided into two halves, with significant variations in content: the first half is a cosmogonic account in which material reality comes into being starting from a state of absence of being; the second half is concerned with human affairs that should always be conducted in accord with the tiandao. The cosmogony presented in the first half of the Heng Xian recalls Daoist cosmological thinking, since it describes the arising of reality from an original state of wuyou 無有 (non-being). This primordial state is defined as pu 樸 (simple), jing 靜 (quiet), and xu 虛 (empty). The cosmogonic process is initially set in motion by the arising of yu 域 (space, boundary), originally written on bamboo as huo 或, followed by qi 氣, defined in the text as self-generating (zi sheng 自生) and self-arising (zi zuo 自作), you 有 (being), shi 始 (beginning), and wang 往 (direction). The text proceeds with the description of the coming into being of the sky and the earth: turbid qi (濁氣) forms the earth, while clear qi (清氣) forms the sky, thereby setting up the space for the various things to reproduce. 
In the second half of the manuscript, the topic changes considerably. From strictly cosmogonic matters, the text moves to human and linguistic matters. First, humans are identified as the cause of the disorder on earth. The text reads: 先者有善, 有治無亂。有人 焉有不善, 亂出於人, “formerly there was good, order, and no chaos. Once there were humans, there was non-good, chaos comes from humans.” Subsequently, the manuscript focuses on the mechanisms of reproduction (fu 復) of things and on the origins of names (ming 名). Fu 復 is most commonly intended in the meaning of “returning”, as for example it its occurrences in the Daodejing 道德經. Yet, in this context, the idea of “repetition” implied by the verb fu seems to be more properly connected to the reproduction of things within the cosmogonic process. In fact, the manuscript does not only give a definition of fu as the process of generation of life  (復, 生之生行), it also states that only fu is the means to avoid dying out (唯復以不廢). With regard to the names, they are said to be established emptily (xu shu 虛樹) to become unchanging (bu ke gai 不可改) only via usual practice (xi 習). Names in the text also appear to be subject to a cosmogonic process: they are said to come from speech, while services in turn come from names (名出於言, 事出於名). The discourse on names, and especially their relationship with the objects to which they refer, was particularly lively during the Warring States (475-221 BCE), especially among the thinkers of the Ming jia 名家 (School of Names) and later Mohists. 
Slip 13 directly involves the enlightened ruling elite (ming wang 明王, ming jun 明君, ming shi 明士) that should be knowledgeable of the cosmology described in the manuscript and, consequently, manage human affairs so to conform them to the “constancy” of the natural proceedings. The manuscript represents one of the earliest testimony on cosmogonic origins from Warring States China. With its detailed account on the transition from an undifferentiated primeval state to the multifaceted reality of the variety of things (cai wu 彩物) through a process of self-generation and self-arising, it provides a crucial insight for the understanding of the cosmogonic thought of ancient China. In particular, the Heng Xian does not only refer to terms prevalent in the cosmogonic debate of the time (such as qi 氣, you/wuyou 有/無有, etc.), but it also incorporates less common categories (such as yu 域 and wang 往) that contribute to making this manuscript distinctive.",-400,-300,1775,1195,Francesca Puglia,2022-11-03 11:02:01.812 +0100,2022-11-19 13:11:05.201 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1570,Tamil Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"Tamil Muslims are a community in southern India who practice Islam. Although a very diverse group, they share some common religious, cultural, and linguistic affinities. They are primarily located in Tamil Nadu, India, with populations spread across India, Sri Lanka, South East Asia, Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), and the United States. Muslims in Tamil Nadu are not a monolithic community; they speak multiple languages (mainly Tamil, Urdu, Telugu, and Bohri Gujarati), and have diverse histories and practices. This entry primarily focuses on Tamil-speaking Muslims in India.

Islam has a long and distinctive history in the Tamil region, at least since ninth century through centuries-old Arab trade, and largely separate from the more familiar narratives of Muslim conquest in north India. The circulation of religious practices and the maintenance of oceanic connections is an important aspect of both Tamil Muslim history as well as the present. The Tamil region has had historical connections with the Bay of Bengal littoral through the circulation of Muslims and their textual practices—between Tamil-speaking South India (Ma’bar) and Southeast Asia (Nusuntara)—since at least the fifteenth century. 

Coastal trading towns in Tamil Nadu became well-known for their religious spaces and institutions—mosques, dargahs (tomb-shrines of Muslim saints), and madrassas (Islamic religious schools). It was not just the southern coastal belt but also northern Tamil Nadu where notable Islamic seminaries were established. The inland city of Madurai was briefly ruled by the Madurai Sultanates in the fourteenth century, while the Urdu-speaking Arcot Nawabs have also had a presence in the region since the seventeenth century.

A simplified sociological and caste-like classification of Tamil-speaking Muslims exists, namely the distinction between Maraikkayar (elite, coastal Sunni Muslims who were originally seafaring merchants),  Lebbai (religious scholars but from a lower social-economic strata), and Rowther (descendants of former Muslim cavalrymen who traded in horses). However, scholars such as Torsten Tschacher have cautioned against the homogenizing imperative and orientalist presuppositions of such sociological distinctions. Although this terminology continues to be used by Muslims today, the diverse ways in which people self-identity with one “sub-group” or the other cannot stand in for a classificatory schema. 

Today, Tamil Nadu is home to various Muslim shrines (dargahs), important pilgrimage centers, historical mosques built in the Dravidian style of architecture, and Islamic seminaries. Tamil Muslim cuisine is distinctive, with influences from Arab, Malay, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asia regions.",20,21,1117,1248,Harini Kumar,2022-11-11 01:51:51.538 +0100,2023-01-13 11:00:10.748 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1571,Kalighat Temple,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Kalighat Temple is a Hindu temple situated in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. The temple name is a Bengali compound made of Kālī—the name of a Hindu goddess—and ghāṭ—the landing stage of a river. Kalighat temple, conforming to the name “the landing stage of Kālī”, is situated beside the Adi Ganga River, the old course of Hooghly river, which is an eastern distributary of the sacred Ganges. 
The Kalighat Temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kālī, a powerful goddess associated with time, death, and destruction in Śakti tradition. Kālī is also considered an incarnation of goddess Satī, whose myth gives sanctity to the Kalighat Temple. It’s widely believed that the right toes of Satī fell in the position of Kalighat, and the relics of Satī’s body are alleged to be found in the Kundupukur tank of the Kalighat Temple. Due to this connection with the myth, Kalighat is listed among the fifty-one śaktipīthas (seats of goddesses), which are pilgrimage sites for goddess worship. Built in the 19th century, Kalighat Temple is a temple complex that hosts not only Kālī, but also Śiva, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and other local goddesses of Bengal. Nowadays, thousands of devotees visit the Kalighat Temple daily to worship and receive the grace of goddess Kālī. As one of the religious centers of Kolkata, Kalighat attracts pilgrims from all over West Bengal and India. In addition to its religious importance, Kalighat Temple is also a thriving economic body, depending on which thousands of sevāyets (temple proprietors), pāṇḍās (priests), shop owners, hawkers, and beggars earn a living. 
Kalighat Temple is well-known for its animal sacrifice. Goat sacrifice, namely pāthābali in Bengali, is performed daily in the temple. One goat is sacrificed every day at noon as the midday meal for goddess Kāli, who is pleased by offerings of blood and flesh. In addition to this regular daily sacrifice, more goats are immolated if devotees come to make goat offerings. Buffalos are also sacrificed during the Durga Puja. The sacrificial violence strongly contradicts the non-violence upheld in mainstream Hinduism, attracting wide criticism from orthodox Hindus, vegetarians, animal lovers, and modernizers. Despite controversies incurred within the Hindu tradition and in the public sphere, animal sacrificial is still performed today as a living tradition in Kalighat Temple, providing an example of how the sacrificial killing prescribed in the medieval scripture Kālikā Purāṇa is performed in contemporary practices.",19,21,1788,1259,Liwen Liu,2022-11-11 22:57:03.509 +0100,2022-11-26 02:57:59.130 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1574,Household religion at Ur,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ur, modern Tell el-Muqayyar, in southern Iraq, is one of the most ancient cities of Mesopotamia; it hosted a very important cult complex dedicated to the Moon-God – Nanna in Sumerian, Suen in Akkadian – including a temple, a ziqqurat and residences for the king and the high priestess. Two extended quarters of private houses, dating from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE were brought to light; they are quite well preserved and many of them featured burials under their floors. Of particular interest are some built underground tombs: according to L. Woolley, their excavator, these tombs were related to large rooms, with special features interpreted as cult installations, and with the largest  room of the house, interpreted as a reception room. The final interpretation was that at Ur they practiced funerary cults  for the ancestors in private chapels, accessible to the members of the household and to their guests. Upon a new analysis of the evidence, it was observed that the connection between built tombs and chapels was not a constant element: in 15 houses there were chapels only; in 15 houses the chapel was related with a tomb; in 17 houses there were the tombs but no chapel. Chapels for private cults are also attested in the same period at Nippur, Tell Asmar and Tell Brak, but they are not associated with tombs. The chapels feature altars ca. 50 cm high and structures looking like miniature temples, up to 1.40 m high; a hearth with a long chimney reaching to the roof was interpreted as an incense-burner. The main interpretations for these chapels are: 1) places for funerary cults (to be dismissed for the lack of a constant correlation with tombs); 2) cult for ""family gods"" (doubtful because minor gods had their small temples within the domestic quarters); 3) places for private ceremonies connecting the extended family and other social groups to enhance social bonds, for instance for marriages and/or economic contracts.",-2000,-1800,1328,1258,Frances Pinnock,2022-11-14 14:26:47.018 +0100,2022-11-14 14:26:47.018 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1576,Book of Amos,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Amos is one of the prophetic books (Nevi'im) canonized in the Hebrew Bible. It is one of twelve ""Minor"" or shorter prophetic books, which in the Jewish Tanakh appear together as a single ""Book of the Twelve,"" whereas they are twelve separate books in the Christian Old Testament. The book of Amos consists of 9 chapters associated with the words and actions of a Judean prophet named Amos. Amos is identified as a pastoralist and agriculturalist from Tekoa in the southern kingdom of Judah, whom Yahweh called to prophesy in the northern kingdom of Israel around the year 760 BCE (1:1; 7:14-15). There is no historical evidence concerning this person outside of the book of Amos. The book claims that the reason Amos was commissioned as a prophet was to warn the Israelites about how their abuses of social justice and their wrongheaded and hypocritical worship practices are going to lead to severe punishment from Yahweh. The sayings and events described in the book appear to take place within a short time period (perhaps no more than a year) during the mid-8th century BCE. The punishment predicted by the prophet Amos has a long tradition of being interpreted as referring to Israel's defeat and exile at the hands of the Neo-Assyrian empire in 721 BCE, but the book never refers to this event explicitly. The book of Amos was originally written in Hebrew, but in its oldest forms it has been preserved in slightly different versions: the Masoretic Text in Hebrew and the Septuagint in Greek. Both of these traditions are attested at Qumran, suggesting that the text of the book of Amos had not been finalized by the first century BCE. Many scholars suggest that parts of the book can be traced back to an 8th-century BCE prophet, but the book as a literary product is mostly the work of later Judean editors, including some belonging to the Deuteronomistic school of thought. The text consists mostly of poetic oracles presented as the words of Yahweh spoken through the prophet Amos, but there are also a few short prose extracts (e.g. Amos 7:10-17).",-760,-100,1795,1214,Rosanne Liebermann,2022-11-15 19:07:58.293 +0100,2022-11-23 23:03:29.653 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1577,Pilgrimage sites associated with the Noyon Khutagt Danzanravjaa,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The sites associated with the lifetime of the Noyon Khutagt Danzanravjaa (1803-1857), the fifth reincarnation in the Noyon Khutagt lineage, in the Dornogovi aimag (province) form an important pilgrimage route in Mongolia. Danzanravjaa was born in the Gobi desert to a poor family during the Qing Empire. He is renowned for being an egalitarian lama (Buddhist religious specialist), a healer, and an influential playwright. The Energy Centre, which is one of the key sites on the pilgrimage is where he is believed to have left his healing energy for those who needed to benefit from its restorative properties following his death.

Many of the other sites are associated with Danzanravjaa's life. One spot on the pilgrimage marks the site of Mongolia’s first theatre which was destroyed during the socialist purges of the 1930s. His play The Life Story of the Moon Cuckoo (Saran Khökhöö Namtar) is one of Mongolia’s most famous plays. Another site is a collection of crumbling meditation caves used by Danzanravjaa and his students, which include a rebirthing cave, an old cherry tree which has miraculously survived in the desert (donated to Danzanravjaa by a Japanese student), and a healing rock.

Most of the artefacts associated with Danzanravjaa’s lifetime managed to survive the socialist purges of the 1930s. When his temple Khamarin Khiid became under threat, the curator of the temple, Lama Tuduv, hid crates of artefacts in the Gobi Desert. Two months later soldiers arrived and ransacked the temple, destroying the temple and killing many of the resident lamas. During the purges of the late 1930s around 36,000 people, half of whom were Buddhist lamas, were killed. Lama Tuduv survived and taught the whereabouts of the hidden artefacts to his grandson. In 1991 his grandson Altangerel dug up the crates and most of the artefacts are now housed in the Danzanravjaa museum in Sainshand. 

Important parts of the pilgrimage now include: Tontoon ovoo, the Energy Centre, the 108 meditation caves, the Ikh Tenger (great sky) Bell, the old site of the theatre, the newly built Khamarin Khiid temple complex, Bayanzurkh mountain, and the Danzanravjaa Museum at Sainshand.",2015,2015,1786,751,Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,2022-11-16 07:55:02.880 +0100,2022-11-28 04:12:13.857 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1578,People's Salvation Cathedral (Catedrala Mântuirii Neamului),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The People's Salvation Cathedral (Catedrala Mântuirii Neamului) is the main house of worship of the Romanian Orthodox Church. It is located on top of Arsenal Hill, in Bucharest’s city centre, surrounded by important state institutions: the Palace of the Parliament eastwards, the Romanian Academy of Sciences south-east and the Ministry of Defence westwards. The cathedral was first conceived in 1881 by King Carol I to celebrate the independence gained against the Ottoman which led to the establishment of the new-born Kingdom of Romania. Following disagreements over the most suitable location, recurrent lack of financing and unfavourable historical events, its realisation was postponed several times until the outbreak of WWII. The project was shelved after Romania became a socialist republic in 1948 and gained again momentum only after its collapse in 1989. Ever since, it took two decades, two different Patriarchs, the benevolent attitude of the whole political spectrum and two ad-hoc laws for construction works to take off. The laying of the foundation stone in 2007 officially started the construction works, which are supposed to end in 2025. The cathedral was consecrated and inaugurated with a week of public celebrations between November and December 2018, on occasion of both St. Andrew’s day (the patron saint of Romania, November 25th) and the 100th anniversary of the Great Union declaration of Alba Iulia (December 1st), which led to the formation of the modern Romanian state. 
Once finished, the cathedral will become the seat of the Romanian Patriarchate and of the Bucharest Archbishopric, whose current leader is Patriarch Daniel Ciobotea. Its alternative name – “national cathedral” – has been adopted by church hierarchs and spokespersons to highlight its civil significance: honouring notable national figures and fallen soldiers by performing funerals and commemorations is, in the eyes of the Patriarch, among the main purposes of this new imposing religious complex. It is 125 meters tall – the highest house of worship in Eastern Christianity – and includes halls, chapels with a crypt, four nuclear shelters, offices and cells, a canteen, a religious articles store, a medical consulting room, a museum of Romanian Orthodox, exhibition rooms, apartments and a council room. When asked about the brand-new cathedral, Patriarch Daniel argued he intended to erect a symbol of national significance, “a Latin-Byzantine basilica, traditional, especially in the interior, but with a Romanian taste, a point of connection between East and West’ (Vasilescu 2010: 538).",1881,2025,1787,814,Giuseppe Tateo,2022-11-16 16:31:18.867 +0100,2022-11-22 18:12:27.413 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1579,Kālikā Purāṇa,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Kālikā Purāṇa (henceforth KP) is a upapurāṇa (minor purāṇa) composed around the 10th to 12th century in Kāmarūpa, an area that includes Assam and part of Bengal today. The title Kālikā refers to goddess Kālī—addressed also as Mahāmāyā, who is a great goddess in śakti tradition. Several Manuscripts of the KP are found in Bengal and Nepal, based on which a critical edition was published by B.N. Shastri in 1991. 
This text is an encyclopedic work on myths, ritual practices, and iconology, providing important information and instruction on goddess worship. The KP grounds its authority in divine revelation and transmission through a lineage of sages, claiming that the purāṇa was first spoken by Brahmā, and transmitted successively through the sages Nārada, Bālakhilya, Yavakrīta, and Asita. Finally, Asita taught this purāṇa to Mārkaṇḍeya, who narrated the KP to human sages (1.16-18). The KP, according to Kooij (2021), follows a fourfold narrative structure. The outmost shell contains maṅgala verses and closing verses spoken by Brahmins. In the second shell, the sage Mārkaṇḍeya narrates the purāṇa to a group of sages (ṛṣi), addressing the myth of Satī’s suicide and her reincarnation as Pārvatī.  He also told a unique version of Durgā slaying the buffalo demon Mahiṣāsura, which serves as a mythological grounding of Durgā Pūjā festival. The third shell is the duties and good conduct of a king. This section is instructed by a muni named Aurva to king Sagara, demonstrating that the composition of the KP might be supported by royal patronage. The fourth shell, which is the innermost part, is Tantric teachings on general worship (sāmāya-pūjā), ritual practices during festivals including Durgā Pūjā, and pilgrimage. Detailed ritual procedures and mantras are instructed by Śiva—the narrator of this section—to his two sons. This section also includes the well-known “blood chapter” (rudhirādhyāya), which prescribes animal sacrifice and even human sacrifice. The blood chapter of the KP provides a scriptural basis for Hindu killing rituals, which are still performed even today in Bengal and Nepal. 
As a widely circulated scripture, the KP exerts a great influence on goddess worship in eastern India. It is considered a scriptural authority regarding rituals for worshipping Kālī and Durgā. Many ritual handbooks, such as Purohit Darpan, attribute their authority to the KP and draw ritual procedures from it. Moreover, the KP is also an important reference for later writers of dharmaśāstric nibandhas. For example, Raghnandana and Viśvanātha extensively quote the KP when discussing the issue of animal sacrifice and meat consumption.",10,12,1797,1259,Liwen Liu,2022-11-18 04:45:55.544 +0100,2022-11-26 02:55:47.589 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1581,Book of Jeremiah,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Jeremiah presents a collection of poetic oracles uttered by the 7th-6th century prophet Jeremiah, primarily in the kingdom of Judah. The book has a complex literary history, however, and it is clear that Jeremiah himself did not produce the book as a whole. At least two different versions of the book existed in antiquity, one of which was translated into Greek during the Second Temple period. Although the book consists of poetic oracles predominately, there are also narrative texts scattered throughout. In general, the material relates to the fall of Judah/Jerusalem to the Babylonians in the early 6th century BCE, an event that Jeremiah understands to be divine punishment from the god Yahweh.",-620,200,1791,1280,Ryan Schroeder,2022-11-19 19:10:10.356 +0100,2024-04-05 18:18:55.643 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1582,Cult of Bona Dea,43,Religious Group (v6),"Who exactly was Bona Dea (“Good Goddess”) can be extrapolated from the myths found in a couple of imperial sources. According to Plutarch (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 29.268DE; Arnobius Nat. 5.18; Lactantius D.I. 1.22.9-11) (Versnel 2006), Bona Dea was the wife of Faunus who was so pure that she never left her room. Yet, one day she secretly became drunk that Faunus beat her to death but repented and made her a deity. Or she, called Fauna, Ops, or Fatua, was the daughter of Faunus who lusted after her, pursued her, and beat her with myrtle branches; he finally achieved his goal after transforming into a snake (Macrob.Sat.1.12.24) (Versnel 2006, 1992). Additionally, there is an account that states that Hercules was celebrating the festival of Bona Dea but was refused a drink by the women; therefore, Hercules excluded women from celebrating his sacrifice at the Ara Maxima (Versnel 2006). There are also some Bacchanal associations in antiquity with the Bona Dea practice (Mulroy 1988; Dieterich 1893), such as the identification of the goddess with Semele (Macrobius 1.12.23), the exaggeration of the ceremony as an orgy (Juvenal 6.314-34), flagellation, the presence of serpents that point to the Maenads, and this would explain Clodius’ cross-dressing (see the account below). Yet, Lott (2014/15), following Brouwer (1989), has claimed that Bona Dea had no male consort in the Roman cult, despite the story given by Plutarch.

What we know about the cult of Bona Dea from literary and archeological evidence is that the cult of Bona Dea may have had origins in Latium and non-uniform cultic practice depending on the social class of the worshipper. In the state cult of Roman religion only women participated in the ceremonies in nocturnal and secret celebrations on December 1st in the house of the leading Roman consul (Brouwer 1989). Under supervision of the wife or mother of the Roman consul of that year, the consul had to leave his house and all the images of male members of the familia (“Roman family’) had to be removed (Versnel 1992, Brouwer 1989). In participation were also the Vestal Virgins (Cic.Har.res.37; Plut.Caes.9), priestesses who took vows of celibacy and attended to the Sacred Flame.

There is some information about the rituals from Cicero and imperial sources. According to ancient literary sources (North 2018; Versnel 2006), the room where the ritual took place was decorated with vine twigs, though myrtle was banned (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 20.268D). There was the sacrifice of a porca (“sow”) (Macrob.Sat.1.12.23), and the drinking of wine, called lac (“milk”), and brought in a mellarium (“honey pot”) (Macrob.Sat.1.12.25; Plut. Quaest. Rom. 20.268D), and there was music and dancing. Versnel 2006 sees this aristocratic practice as a vestigial element of an older Roman practice that celebrated human and agricultural activity, and its closeness to the Greek festival of Demeter, the Thesmophoria, which took place in the political center of the city, denied men access, celebrated female reproductivity, allowed women the rights of men, such as the enjoyment of wine (Versnel 2006; 1992; not absolute rule, see Piccaluga 1964; De Cazanova 1987; Aulus Gellius 10.23.1-2), but excluded myrtle, because myrtle was closely associated with Venus (sexuality) in the ancient sources, such as Plutarch (Quaest.Rom.20), Pliny (NH 15.121), and Varro (de ling.lat. 5.154) (Brouwer 1989). Because wine was also an aphrodisiac (Val. Max. 2.1.5), myrtle was removed in order to highlight a ritualistic use of the wine traditionally offered to the gods (temetum) (Versnel 1992) (Brouwer 1989). If one considers the presence of the Vestal Virgins as well, the Roman matrons too are considered ambiguously virgins (Versnel 1992).

Hence the great scandal in 62 BC involving Publius Clodius Pulcher whose account is detailed fully in Plutarch’s Caesar 9-10 (his political enemy Cicero also makes some remarks on Clodius’ cross dressing: Ad Atticum.1.12.2; 1.13.3). As the story goes, Clodius was in love with Pompeia, married to Caesar and who was being watched by her mother-in-law Aurelia. Because of this, Clodius dressed up as a flute girl in order to see Pompeia on the night of the Bona Dea at her house (also in Cic.de Haruspicum Responsis 5.8). He was admitted by a slave girl who was involved in the scheme, and Clodius, tired of waiting for Pompeia, went to go find her. In some accounts (Velleius Paterculus 2.45.1, Suet.Caesar 6.2; Appian Bella Civilia .2.14.52; Cassius Dio 37.45; Livy’s epitome 103), building upon Cicero’s speeches (Mil.72, Harusp.8; Pis.95) Clodius and Pompeia committed adultery (Mulroy 1988). In Plutarch’s version, however, he was accosted by another slave girl, who first asked him to play with her, and he answered that he was waiting for Habra, the very name of his inquirer. Habra recognized the male voice and screamed that a man was present. Aurelia stopped the service and Clodius was found hiding in Habra’s room. The women went home, told their husbands, and political outcry occurred. As a result, Caesar divorced Pompeia.

Another important cult site in the city of Rome was that of the Aventine Hill where a temple and images of snakes were found. At first, the cult utilized the image and symbol of the Italic serpent which was a protective and guardian spirit; yet over time with the association of Bona Dea and Hygieia and other Greek influence, the snake became associated with prophecy and healing (Brouwer 1989). Returning to the temple and grove on the Aventine (Morgan 2014, Merlin 1906, Rubino 1868, Gilbert 1883-90), it has been identified as Bona Dea Subsaxsana (Propertius 4.9.24, 25, 33, 35, 53, 59-60; Ovid. Fasti. 3.327-30; and a Severan marble plan) and her celebrations occurred on May 1st. This festival in May mirrors that of the State Cult practice on December 1st where a female sacerdos (“priestess” in this context) led a secret rite that included the sacrifice of a (pregnant) sow, the use of wine, and prohibition of men from participation. Here, it is important to note that the sacrifice of the sow (Macrobius Saturnalia 1.12.20-29 and Juvenal 1.2.92-90) is rather scanty and there are examples in non-state cult functions, such as a fowls (Pliny NH 10.61 (77)) and heifers (via Ostiense , CIL Vi 68= ILS 3513)(Brouwer 1989).

There were also imperial practices outside the city of Rome. For example in Aquileia, although numerous inscriptions (CIL 5 761-762=ILS 3498-3499) point to a goddess with agricultural characteristics not emphasized in the Roman cult (Lott 2014/15), there was a temple dedicated to Augusta Bona Dea Cereria at Aquileia (Ov.Fas.5.157-8), restored by Livia, the wife of the emperor of Augustus. This location was not only for honoring Livia, but a center of worship of the goddess in which there was cake distribution on Livia’s birthday (ILS 154)(Lott 2015/15)(Brouwer 1989). Imperial Augustan involvement might be corroborated by Berry’s (2011) analysis of the Bona Dea and Hercules episode recounted in Propertius 4, 9 where Hercules (representing imperial legislation on proper sexual behavior) bursts into the Sacred Grove, its waters, and dancing girls (private and elegiac context). According to Berry, the episode is a commentary on the legislation of 18 BC lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus the intrusion of public world into Roman private lives. Yet, the combination of imperial nomenclature at Aquileia and the local goddess demonstrates how local communities built a consensus and relationship with the new imperial regime (Lott 2015/15) (Ando 2000).
 
We also know that throughout Latium and Rome there was the involvement of collegia (“professional clubs”) that invoked Bona Dea as their patroness. Inscriptions paint a different picture from the aristocratic, political rituals detailed above (North 2018, and Versnel 2006). In the cultic practice by Roman collegia, there was no secrecy and men could participate (Brouwer 1989). Collegia members and ritual activity involving Bona Dea could include children, such as a seven-year-old priest (Waltzing I)(Brouwer 1989) and numbers of participants from 16 (CIL XIV 252 = Waltzing III, p.618, #2233) to 1,5000 (CIL VI 1060, 9405, 10.300 = Waltzing III, pp.199-200)(Brouwer 1989). Leaders of collegia and cult activity had numerous titles associated with them: curator, magister, minister, with sacerdos usually in the east (Brouwer 1989) and meeting locations could include aedes (“shrines”) or templa where the patron deity resided.

Other non-Roman cult practices included a Liburnian Bona Dea (CIL 5 757=ILS 4894), who was paired with the male deity, Fonio (Lott 2014/15). Also, a temple found in Ostia with paintings, excavated in 1938-1942 by Calza dating to the AD first century (Falzone 2006). The temple occupied a trapezoidal area in the back of the via degli augustali and had Late Republic to Domitian phases (Falzone 2006). The paintings found in the temple and portico depicted dancing Maenads and, perhaps, a Satyr, the offering of the grape (wine), and Dionysian elements all recall themes found in the myths of the Bona Dea (Falzone 2006). There is also a second temple found in Ostia outside the Porta Marina (Calza 1942; Meiggs 1973; Brouwer 1989). Finally, numerous inscriptions, such as in Segni in south Latium (EE VIII 624 = Dessau, ILS 3496)  and Fidenae (NSc.1929,263,Nr.11) that show that clothes were dedicated to the goddess, are attested throughout Italy and demonstrate is popular practice.

Bona Dea, moreover, was worshiped in private homes and demonstrate a multiplicity of ideas regarding the role Bona Dea played in the lives of private individuals under the Roman Empire. The most notable is the dedication of Calpurnia found in Dalmatia that included a host of titles, such as Heiae, Dominae, Augustae, Triumphali, terrae/marisque Dominatrici, Conservatrici, Mentiumque bonarum ac remediorum Potenti, Dea bene iudicanti  (Brouwer 1989, ch.1 #127). Here we can see Greek and Eastern influence on the salvific powers of Bona Dea. Some scholars have suggested that the Greek goddess was introduced in the 3rd century BC, while others, argued for a genuine Italian character. Versnel 2006 suggests that there was one Italian and one Greek, and at some point, the cults merged into one. Whatever the case may be, it seems that the female goddess was the protector of her locality.

In sum, the cult of the Bona Dea, perhaps, began in Latium and as Roman power expanded in the Mediterranean so did the cult (found also in Africa and Gaul), while it also adopted ideas from Greek and Eastern religions. The cult, perhaps, although epigraphic and literary sources at earliest date back to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, began in the prehistory of Latium (Brouwer 1989) and lasted until the 5th century AD, although some have argued for an earlier date of demist to the Antonine plague in 2nd and the Cyprian plague in the 3rd century AD (Ambasciano 2016). The cult of Bona Dea, however, nevertheless continued to enjoy literary discussion well into the 8th century AD, such as the Epitome of Paulus Diaconus (ca. AD 720/730-797) (Epitome s.v. Damium). Finally, the cult enjoyed worship from every facet of Roman life, ranging from the aristocratic state cult practices to that of even freedmen and slaves.

For the most comprehensive treatment of the cult of Bona Dea, epigraphic and literary sources, locations of cults, and practitioners, see Brouwer 1989.",-300,500,132,733,Juan Dopico,2022-11-19 20:18:36.175 +0100,2023-02-17 03:35:20.634 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1584,Tafattuq al-aḥkām,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Šayj (شيخ) Muḥammad al-Sanūsī (محمد السنوسي) wrote and published the text at hand in 1890. The book was somewhat famous because, despite having been written by a scholar educated in conservative al-Zaytuna mosque, it was one of the first in Tunisia to rally for women's education.

The book covers almost all of the Qur'anic dispositions regarding women, such as polygyny and testimony, from a conservative point of view that aligns with hegemonic interpretations of the times. The only topic that is portrayed under a different light is that of education. The book is filled with Qur'anic quotations as well as ahadith (أحاديث) to back the author's explanations of said issues and the laws related to them.

Despite the fact that the book was not too well-known (except among fellow Zaytuna scholars), it did serve as a precedent for the educational reform, particularly with regards to the inclusion of women in education. The time scope we have chosen for the present entry reflects the period from the publication of the book until the Tunisian independence because it was in 1956 that the Law of Personal Status was published. Considering the topics covered by the text at hand and those present in the aforementioned law, we believe it is safe to assume that what little influence the text at hand could possibly have had in Tunisian society and the female emancipation and educational reform debates ended after the proclamation of the law.",1890,1956,341,1229,Tatiana Hernández-Justo,2022-11-22 14:01:01.790 +0100,2022-12-24 22:21:42.203 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1585,Jingde chuandeng lu 景德傳燈錄,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Jingde chuandenglu (Record of the Transmission of the Lamp [Compiled in] the Jingde era) was initially titled the Fozu tongcan ji 佛祖同参集 when the Buddhist monk Daoyuan 道原 (ﬂ. ca. 1000) presented his compilation of Chan transmission records to the Song court in 1004. Daoyuan, known as a Fayan-lineage 法眼宗 monk from the Chengtian Yong’an Monastery 承天永安院 in Suzhou 蘇州, was a disciple of Tiantai Deshao 天台德韶 (891-972) who served as preceptor of the state of the Wuyue regime. It is documented that Daoyuan’s compilation adopted a multilineal framework that arranged the name of 1701 figures (52 generations predicated on the master-disciple relationship) and delineated the transmission histories from the Seven Buddhas of the Past, Indian patriarchs, and eventually, to the Fayan lineage. //
Under Emperor Zhenzong’s 真宗 (r. 997-1022) imperial edict, leading scholarly literati Yang Yi 楊億 (974-1020), Li Wei 李維 and Wang Shu 王曙 (963-1034) supervised the editorial work of Daoyuan’s compilation. According to the Xu zizhi tongjian changbian 續資治通鑑長編, the thirty-fascicle Jingde chuandeng lu was accomplished and issued in 1009. In this current title, “Jingde” refers to the reign title of Emperor Zhenzong, and “chuangdeng lu” represents the way that dharma was transmitted from master to disciple similar to how one lamp lights up another. In Yang Yi’s accounts, this edited compilation included the names of 1760 figures and 1169 entries. However, extant woodblock-printed editions of the Jingde chuandeng lu went through later editing and did not preserve the full text of the original records. Among varied extant editions, two main editions are the Tōji 東寺 edition (printed in 1080 in the Dongchan Monastery 東禪寺 in Fuzhou 福州) and the Sibu congkan 四部叢刊 edition (issued in 1316 in the Daochang chanyou Temple 道場禪幽庵 in Huzhou 湖州). The standard text cited in modern scholarship came from the Taishō shinshu daizōkyō 大正新修大蔵経, which employed the Sibu congkan edition. Both the Tōji and Sibu congkan editions contain the name of 1709 people and 966 entries. //
Entries of Chan masters in the Jingde chuandeng lu include their sermons, transmission verses, poems, and dialogues with disciples. According to recent scholarship, the compilation of this work drew on earlier Chan transmission records. The multilineal style first appeared as the arrangement format of the Zutang ji 祖堂集. The list of Indian patriarchs came from the Baolin zhuan 寶林傳. In addition to these two collections, other extant Chan genealogical histories prior to the Jingde chuandeng lu include the Chuan Fabao ji 傳法寶紀, the Lengqie shizi ji 楞伽師資記, and the Lidai Fabao ji 曆代法寶記. However, the Jingde chuandeng lu was distinct from previous Chan genealogical histories as it received imperial sanction from the Song court and had its influence transcending the regional boundaries. //
In 1011, the Jingde chuandeng lu obtained Emperor Zhenzong’s permission to be incorporated into the Song Buddhist canon. Another version of this work, the fifteen-fascicle abridged version compiled by scholarly bureaucrat Wang Sui 王隨 (973-1039) and titled Chuandeng yuying ji 傳燈玉英集, was submitted to Emperor Renzong 仁宗 (r. 1022-1063) in 1034 and granted to become an inclusion of the Buddhist canon as well. As the first work of the denglu (lamp records) genre, the Jingde chuandeng lu established a model for subsequent Chan genealogical histories sanctioned by the Song court, such as the Tiansheng guangdeng lu 天聖廣燈錄, the Jianzhong jingguo xudeng lu 建中靖國續燈錄, and the Jiatai pudeng lu 嘉泰普燈錄. //
Besides its impact on later genealogical histories, the Jingde chuandeng lu was also involved with the development of other genres of Chan texts. Recent studies proved that cases of Chan masters compiled in later gong’an 公案 collections were initially documented in the Jingde chuandeng lu. Similarities in language styles between denglu and yulu 語錄 were also discerned.//
Considering the historicity of Chan transmission records, scholars suggest that the Jingde chuandeng lu should be viewed as didactic work that served certain religious purposes. According to existing scholarship, Daoyuan’s compilation aimed at promoting the Fayan lineage. Meanwhile, Yang Yi’s editing portrayed Chan as “a separate practice outside the teaching” to help provide a literary model that distinguished Song culture. With the effort of Chan monks and scholarly literati, the compilation of this work was influential in defining the self-identity of Chan.",1004,1004,1248,730,Yi Liu,2022-11-23 01:32:55.405 +0100,2022-12-29 05:55:07.747 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1587,The Early Christian Basilicas of Ancient Aksūm (modern Ethiopia and Eritrea),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"More than a dozen structures attest to the spread of Christianity in the kingdom of Aksum, located in Ethiopia and Eritrea from the fourth century CE to the seventh century CE. The Aksumite King ʿEzana converted to Christianity in the early fourth century CE. The conversion took place shortly after Constantine’s own conversion and at a time when the neighboring kingdom of Ḥimyar located in South Arabia (modern Yemen and Saudi Arabia) converted to a Jewish-sympathizing monotheism around 380. Literary sources attribute Aksūm’s conversion to Christianity to the influence of the first bishop of Aksūm, a man named Frumentius, who was ordained by Athanasius. Local tradition states that at the end of the fifth century, nine saints/monks who had fled persecution in the eastern Roman Empire contributed to the founding of monasticism in the region. Early churches of Aksūm include the two tombs of the sixth-century negus Kaleb and his son Gäbrä Mäsqäl, located at a site known as Endā Kaleb. Southeast of Aksūm, the Basilica of Arbaʿətu ∃nsəsa presents a similar rectangular structure with three naves. Archaeologists have also identified two churches near Betä Giyorgis, a hill northwest of Aksūm, but only one of the two has been properly excavated. Archaeologists have also found a small basilica that has been tentatively dated to the sixth century at Endā Qirqos at Ḥawəlti-Melazo, ten kilometers south of Aksum. Outside of the capital of Aksūm, archaeologists have identified a basilica in the Ethiopian village of Agula (ca. 150 kilometers southeast of Aksūm). Several sites have been uncovered in Eritrea, at Adulis (near modern Zula), Mätära (ca. 150 kilometers northeast of Aksūm), Toḵonda, and Qoḥayto (both near modern Adi Keyh, ca. 20 kilometers north of the city of Mätära). The most recent addition to the early Christian archaeology of Ethiopia is the basilica of Betä Sämaʿti’, located near the modern village of Edaga Rabu. Radiocarbon analysis, along with the study of pottery, has demonstrated that the basilica was used as early as the 4th century CE and is thus one of the oldest basilicas in the Horn of Africa. The basilicas of Aksūm have an East-West oriented rectangular tripartite plan. A stone podium, an altar on the eastern side of the building, and monolithic pillars dividing the central nave from the aisles are usually present. The width and length of the nave and the number of columns can vary, and so do the narthex and apse.",300,800,1798,1109,Valentina A.

This interpretation has witnessed many Arab and foreign studies and theses. It was a source for many Brotherhood and non-Brotherhood studies, (educational thought in the interpretation of Sayyid Qutb; Jihad in Fi Dhilal al-Qur’an...). 
This interpretation was written in circumstances characterized by great intellectual confusion, weakness in political organization, and the absence of social and economic choices.

1589,Peshitta,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Peshitta (P) is the Syriac translation of the Bible. It consists of both the Old and the New Testament. Its translation process started already during the second century CE, and the translation itself has been used until today (This is the reason for the timeframe/2CE-21CE/ given to this article). It is only in the 9th century that this corpus was given the name 'Peshitta'. One can speak of P as both the earliest translation of biblical narratives into Syriac and a corpus reflected in the manuscript tradition. As for the first point, previous scholarship has extensively debated about the earliest date of the translation, but has never been able to clearly answer the question of its origins. The scholars basically all agree that it is impossible to determine the starting date of the translation. The answers to this question depend on the angle with which it is approached. Weitzman argued that the translation must predate the fourth-century Syriac fathers Aphrahat and Ephrem, who quoted it extensively, but cannot be later than about 200 CE because P-Gen uses a particle (yt) that Ephrem no longer understood. What can be debated, on the other hand, is the Syriac of P as attested in the manuscripts available for each biblical book and their complete compilation by the various editors. Given its textual history, the text of P is, therefore, the result of three interrelated processes. First, the initial (oral or textual) process of translating the biblical narratives. Second, the compilation of the originally translated narratives into larger units. For example, complete biblical books or liturgical readings. Third, Syriac biblical narratives attested in the manuscript tradition. In this respect, we can say that P is the title given to a collection of translated biblical texts which includes both biblical narratives and independent manuscript headings. The main characteristic of P is that it spans several centuries of use, involving multiple processes of textual interpolation that are visible in either minor or major textual differences in the manuscripts. Textual idiosyncrasies of the Peshitta reflect its rich history and importance within the Syriac tradition.
Nota bene - the region indicated here is the approx. region restricted to the first centuries of the Peshitta.  Today, it is basically used wherever there is a Syriac community, Peshitta user or scholar (and this would probably cover the whole world).
(For better understanding of this entry, I recommend you read it along with the 'Targums' and 'Septuagint' entries. Namely, Peshitta, Septuagint and Targums reflect similar methodological questions, and occasionally they can share some features).",2,21,1800,770,Srecko Koralija,2022-11-28 16:29:38.906 +0100,2022-12-16 22:20:43.896 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1591,Alchi temple complex,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Alchi temple complex is one of the earliest and most culturally significant (wc) Buddhist sites in the western Himalayas. It is located in the Leh district of Ladakh in the present-day state of Jammu-Kashmir, India. The site consists of five temples and several stupas (chörtens) built between the eleventh/thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This was a period of political fragmentation and declining religious patronage in the kingdom of Tibeta, based in the central Tibetan plateau. As a result, the western Himalayas (Ngari) arose as the dominant political and religious authority. It also was an important nexus of trade and pilgrimage routes from neighboring Kashmir and central Tibet. During this period, religious and political elites sponsored production of new temples and monasteries in the region. These structures have become a primary trove for studying the period since there are few extant textual sources. The Alchi complex’s earliest two temples—called the Dukhang (“Assembly Hall”) and the Sumtsek (a three-storeyed temple) —were built shortly after this shift in power and provide valuable information about religious, political, and social aspects of the day. Local tradition holds that the Dukhang is one of 108 temples built under the auspices of renowned translator Lotsawa Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055). The date of the Sumtsek is the subject of ongoing scholarly debate. Some scholars posit an 11th-century date, whereas argue that it was bult in the 13th century. A painted panel depicting the nascent Drigung Kagyu lineage is central to this debate. There is a general consensus, however, that the Dukhang was built shortly before the Sumtsek. Each temple contains an inscription naming the temple’s founder. The Dukhang was founded by Kalden Sherab and the Sumtsek was founded by Tsultrim Ö, both members of the ruling Dro clan. The Dukhang and Sumtsek, as well as neighboring Sumda and Mangyu temples, share thematic and stylistic features. Collectively, these temples are called “The Alchi group.” These temples’ architecture is typical of central Tibetan structures, but their interior murals and sculptures are executed in a Kashmiri style, suggesting the artists were themselves Kashmiri. As such, the murals are a rare example of surviving Kashmiri painting. In addition to the overall Buddhist iconographic program, the murals depict patrons, devotees, and textiles which elucidate the material, cultural, and economic makeup of this well-connected political and religious authority. Today, Alchi is no longer an active monastery, but continues to draw pilgrims and tourists alike.",950,1500,1801,855,Rachel Levy,2022-12-01 23:53:01.771 +0100,2022-12-02 23:26:49.880 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1595,The Five Yi Yin Texts,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Five Yi Yin Texts are a group of ancient Chinese bamboo-slip manuscripts that were looted, sold to the Hong Kong Antiquites Market, and purchased by Tsinghua University in 2008. The names of these manuscripts, some of which were given by the Tsinghua editors (indicated by an asterisk), are *Yin zhi 尹至 *Yin's Arrival (Volume 1), *Yin gao 尹誥 *Yin’s Announcement (Volume 1), Chi jiu zhi ji Tang zhi wu 赤鳩之集湯之屋 A Red Pigeon’s Alighting on Tang’s Hut (Volume 3), *Tang zai chimen 湯在啻門 *Tang at the Gate of the Thearch (Volume 5), and *Tang chu yu Tangqiu 湯處於湯丘 *Tang Resided at Tang Hill (Volume 5). Scholars have come to treat these five manuscripts of unknown authorship as a group, because they all focus on the exemplary relationship between Tang, the first king of Shang, and his legendary minister Yi Yin. The first two texts, *Yin zhi and *Yin gao, tell stories about Tang and Yi Yin’s conquest of Jie, the last king of Xia. They are identified by most scholars as belonging to the textual tradition of the Shang shu 尚書 or “Exalted Scriptures.” The third text, Chi jiu, was originally bound together with *Yin zhi and *Yin gao and copied by the same scribe, but unlike the historical anecdotes in the other two texts, it is a fantastic story about magic, exorcism, and numinous animals. The last two, *Tang zai chimen and *Tang chu yu Tangqiu, were also bound together and copied by the same hand (though not the one that copied the above three). Both are philosophical dialogues between Tang and Yi Yin. While *Tang zai chimen constructs a systematic cosmology of heaven, earth, state, and person, *Tang chu yu Tangqiu centers around the virtue of the king and its political significance. Prior to the discovery of these manuscript, there were already numerous anecdotes about Yi Yin in ancient Chinese texts. As philosophers and storytellers often used him to illustrate their arguments, Yi Yin came to assume several new identities as a spy, a cook, and a dowry escort in the Warring States period. All of these identities are seen in the Tsinghua manuscripts, but they rarely have argumentative functions.",-335,-275,1813,1236,Boqun Zhou,2022-12-03 13:31:31.904 +0100,2022-12-07 08:19:51.693 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1600,Serabit el-Khadem: An Egyptian and Semitic Mining Community,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"An interesting site in the Sinai frequented by both Semitic and Egyptian populations with evidence for worship of both Egyptian and Semitic deities. It is most interesting for three factors: 1) it's existence as a turquoise mine, 2) its temple to Hathor which exists for multiple centuries, is renovated, and eventually contains an addition to Sopedu, and 3) the existence of Proto-Sinaitic alphabetic inscriptions related to Semitic peoples and deities. The Hathor temple is initially built in the Middle Kingdom, presumably over an original cave dedicated to Hathor. Hathor eventually becomes associated with turquoise, as seen by her epithets in inscriptions at the site. Perhaps due to this development, significant additions to the temple were undertaken during the Late Bronze Age under the reigns of Thutmose III, Hatshepsut, Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV, and Amenhotep  III, while inscriptions bearing the names of Ramesses II, Ramesses IV, and Ramesses VI convey  their interest in the site. 
For historical reconstructions, Hathor’s name is also important as it gradually loses the foreign land determinative. As I have argued elsewhere, a shift of assumption occurs in that the Egyptians at the site are no longer worshipping in a foreign land. Instead, the land has ideologically become a part of Egypt. Simply  put, the foreign land determinative is no longer used because the Egyptians no longer consider Serabit el-Khadem to be part of a foreign land.
The religious importance of the site may predate Egyptian presence, with the site perhaps initially connected to a Semitic deity. The numerous hieroglyphic inscriptions at the site do little to clarify the picture. The possible existence of an earlier Semitic cult, likely dedicated to Baalat, arises from a small corpus of ~40 Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, dating roughly to 1700-1400 BCE and presumably inscribed by the native Semitic workers at the site, of which at least 5 contain the name of the goddess. These inscriptions were originally published by Alan Gardiner in 1916, and the interpretation of bʿlt as Baalat has largely  remained accepted. The content of the inscriptions, however, does little to clarify the nature of Semitic worship at the site. The inscriptions are short and dedicatory in nature, although they do convey that other Semitic deities, such as Teššub, were also worshipped at the site.",-1900,-1200,1816,700,Shane M.

1601,Göbekli Tepe,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"UNESCO World Heritage Site located near the city of Şanlıurfa (Turkey). It is one of the most spectacular early Neolithic settlements in the entire Near East. The tell is 9 ha and has more than 10 metres of archaeological deposits dating back to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period (9500 BCE - 8000 BCE approximately). Due to the large number of decorated stone monuments, sculptures and massive elliptical architectural installations this site is considered an important ritual centre. Some claim that the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe are the world's first temples, while others believe that they are the result of social practices of hunter-gatherers of the region as similar stone monuments and structures have been found in other nearby settlements such as Karahan Tepe, Harbetsuvan Tepesi and Hamzan Tepe. Since the early 1990s, excavations at Göbekli Tepe supported by the German Archaeological Institute and the Turkish authorities have brought to light hundreds of decorated limestone pillars, sculptures and reliefs. Many of the figures depicted are wild animal such as foxes, felines, birds and scorpions. The T-shaped pillars that characterised most of the buildings are believed to represent human beings due to the anthropomorphic motifs carved on some of these limestone monuments. It is unknown what they might represent, whether deities, guardians, ancestors or perhaps other creatures. So far, only a few human remains have been unearthed and it is still not entirely clear what kind of mortuary practices and other ritual forms were performed at the site. Feasting and shamanism are activities hypothesised in light of the iconography and published archaeological evidence, but alternative interpretations are equally possible.

1602,A Record of Buddhist Monasteries in Luoyang,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Buddhists living in the imperial capital of Luoyang under the Northern Wei Dynasty of China in the fifth and sixth centuries, including monastics, foreign visitors, and laypeople (both nobility and commoners).

A Record of Buddhist Monasteries in Luoyang (Chinese: Luoyang qielan ji, 洛陽伽藍記) was written in approximately 547 CE by Yang Xuanzhi (Chinese: 楊衒之 fl. 6th century CE) about the many Buddhist monasteries and temples that had formerly been present in the historic Chinese capital of Luoyang (modern Shaanxi province). Luoyang had been most recently rebuilt as the capital of the Northern Wei dynasty (386-535 CE), when Emperor Xiaowen (r. 471-499 CE) relocated the empire’s capital there as part of his reforms and the city boasted over a thousand Buddhist temples in addition to imperial palaces and institutions of government. However, Luoyang had been largely destroyed amidst the destructive civil wars that marked the end of the Northern Wei, and by the time of Yang’s writing, he noted that few temples remained, and sought to provide future generations with a record of their existence, along with stories associated with their presence.
	The Record is subdivided into five major sections covering temples located in the inner city, along with those in the suburbs, ordered by cardinal direction. Yang records detailed descriptions of the major temples present in Luoyang, including architectural details and functions of their buildings, their physical location within the city, and crucially, many political and cultural events associated with them. A typical entry for a temple would include its name, sponsors, construction date, and noteworthy aspects of its construction, especially landmarks such as towers and Buddhist images. The prose of the Record intersperses Yang’s descriptions and accounts with notes on the individuals and events he describes, providing valuable insights into the religio-cultural and social life of the capital city during the early medieval period. The entries on individuals and events include prose noting major political upheavals such as rebellions and palace intrigues, as well as short biographies of people associated with the temple, both monastic and lay.
	The last section of the text focus on the northern suburbs of the city but also includes an extensive travelogue recounting a pilgrimage from 518-522 CE led by Northern Wei emissaries Song Yun and Hui Sheng to the Western Regions (modern Central Asia). Song and Hui’s account also record cultural and religious traditions they observed in the cities of the areas they visited, including locations of Buddhist miracles, the religiosity of the rulers, and foreign relations between the countries.

1603,The Orthodox Monasteries of Meteora,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Meteora (meaning “suspended in the air” in Greek) in the region of Thessaly (Greece), is a group of monasteries built on the summits of vertical sandstone formations, which average 300 m in height while several of them are reaching 550 m.
From the 11th century onwards, hermits established their dwellings in the lesser peaks of the sandstones. They eventually formed a single monastic community, of which remains today the 12th century chapel of the Theotokos at the base of the pillar of Doupiani, after which the monastery was named. In the 14th century the Athonite monk Athanasios founded the first monastery built on a summit, the Great Meteoron. Meteora reached the peak of their prosperity in the 16th century. From the 24 monasteries that were built, only six are still functioning today, while the rest are in ruinous state.
1. The Great Meteoron: the church of the oldest and largest of the monasteries of Meteora built by Athanasios in the 14th century is dedicated to the Virgin, while cells for the monks were added later. The second church (the present katholikon) built in 1387-1388 by monk Ioasaph (the Serbian ruler of Thessaly and Epirus Jovan Uroš Nemanjić or John Ouresis Doukas Palaiologos). In 1544-1545 was built a new katholikon dedicated to the Transfiguration of Christ, to which the old church was integrated. It was decorated with frescoes in 1552. The successors of Athanasios expanded the monastery by adding more cells, a hospital, a chapel and renovated the two churches. 
2. Varlaam Monastery: the name of the second largest monastery of Meteora comes from the monk who climbed the cliff and founded the monastery around 1350. Varlaam built in total three churches but after his death, the monastery was abandoned, until the beginning of the 16th century when the priest-monks Theophanes and Nektarios Apsara, members of a Byzantine noble family settled there. In 1518 they renovated the church of the Three Hierarchs. In 1541 they built the present katholikon, dedicated to All Saints. It was decorated with frescoes in 1548. In 1627 the chapel of the Three Hierarchs was rebuilt and was frescoed in 1637.
3. Rousanou Monastery: it is believed to have been established in the 14th century, while the 16th century monastery preserved until today, was built by the brothers Ioasaph and Maximos. The katholikon was frescoed in 1560 following the style of the Cretan school of Byzantine iconography. It received the name “Roussanou” probably from the first monk who settled on the rock on which the monastery was built. The monastery is dedicated to the Transfiguration of Christ, although it is also dedicated to saint Barbara.
4. Holy Trinity Monastery: it is believed that the actual monastery was built between 1475-1476, although there is evidence that the first monk who lived at the site was Dometios, in 1362. The wall paintings of the katholikon were completed in different phases. In 1741 brothers Antonios and Nikolaos completed the inside of the church. The esonarthex built in 1689 was decorated in 1692. In 1682 was built and decorated the chapel of saint John the Baptist. 
5. Saint Stephen Monastery: it is believed that monks were living on the site since the end of the 12th century and that the founder of the monastery was a monk named Ieremias. The monastic complex was built in the 14th century by the monk Antonios Kantakouzinos, although the present katholikon dedicated to saint Charalampos is a structure of 1798 with frescoes of the 1980s. The old church was constructed at the time of the monastery’s foundation or shortly thereafter and was rebuilt by monk Philotheos in 1545. Its painted decoration was executed in two phases. The first phase probably dates from the period spanning the second and the third decade of the 17th century. The second phase was completed around the middle of the same century.  
6. Saint Nicholas Anapafsas Monastery: it was founded in the late 14th century. It has served as a resting place for pilgrims and so it received the name “Anapafsas”, meaning “the one who rests you” in Greek. The first katholikon of the monastery dedicated to saint Anthony was decorated with frescoes in the 14th century. The monastery was renovated in the first decade of the 16th century, when the present main church dedicated to saint Nicholas was built, and in the 1960s. In 1527 the famous Cretan painter, founder of the Cretan school of Byzantine iconography, Theophanes Strelitzas Bathas painted the katholikon.",1000,2022,1819,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2022-12-11 15:41:13.913 +0100,2022-12-11 20:13:22.355 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Depuis l'avènement des Turcs, l'école de pensée hanafite est revenue en force et est devenue, avec l'école de pensée Malikite, la tendance officielle de la jurisprudence de l'État . De nombreuses mosquées sont devenues des mosquées hanafites pour accueillir les nouveaux arrivants, comme La mosquée al-Qasr et la mosquée de la Kasbah. Ils ont également construit de nombreuses autres mosquées tout au long de la période de la domination ottomane en Tunisie, et parmi ces mosquées se trouvent la mosquée Hammouda Pacha, la ""Nouvelle mosquée"" qui a été construit par le fondateur de l'État Husaynite, Al-Hussein bin Ali, la mosquée Yusuf Dey et la mosquée Yusuf Sahib Al-Tabaa, qui est la dernière mosquée ottomane construite en Tunisie.
La mosquée de Yusuf Sahib al-Tabaa est la seule mosquée hanafite qui n'a pas été construite par Bey ou Dai, mais plutôt par un ministre mamelouk d'origine moldave. La construction a commencé en 1808 et la première prière a eu lieu le 4 mars 1814. Il a été construit par l'ingénieur Hajj Sassi bin Freijeh.Selon Muhammad bin Al-Khawja, le marbre utilisé a été importé du sud de l'Italie. La mosquée se compose de nombreux bâtiments et forme un complexe appelé ""la kuliya"" comme le système kuliya à Istanbul et se compose d'une mosquée, d'un tombeau, d'écoles, d'un hôtel et de magasins.
La pièce de la prière est accessible par cinq portes. elle est de forme rectangulaire, long de 31,2 mètres et large de 25,77 mètres.

1613,The Pagoda-Shaped Diamond Sutra Shroud,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"In 1975, a pagoda-shaped Diamond Sutra was excavated from a Ming tomb in Jiaxing 嘉興, Zhejiang province. This tomb is believed to have been the joint grave for the eminent Ming scholar and connoisseur Xiang Yuanbian 項元汴 (1525-1590) and for his wife—Lady Qian, The Child Nurturess 錢孺人, as well as Xiang’s concubines. The magnificent pagoda-shaped Diamond Sutra was found covering on the top of Lady Qian’s coffin as a shroud. The shroud-sutra is 184.5cm long, and 58cm wide, presenting the full text of Diamond Sutra (more than 5000 characters) interspersed with the icons of the Buddha. The Diamond Sutra is one of the most popular Mahayana Buddhist texts. It takes the form of a dialogue between the Buddha as teacher and a disciple as questioner. Elaborating on the illusory nature of phenomena, it focuses on the thesis that spiritual realization is to be achieved through transcending rational categories. The text features very boldly-stated expressions and striking paradoxes (including frequent identification of things with their opposites), closely corresponding to the philosophy of Chan/Zen Buddhism.
The shroud-sutra found in the Ming tomb is a black-white stone rubbing and the original picto-text was inscribed on a stele which was commissioned by Xiang and Qian’s son Xiang Mu 項穆 (1550-1600). The uniqueness of this burial object is twofold: 1) it is an extraordinary combination of mingjing 銘旌 (the inscribed funeral streamer) which is a common implement in traditional Chinese burial customs, and a Buddhist sutra; 2) it demonstrates an ingenious use of precisely choreographed characters from the Diamond Sutra rather than architectural lines to compose the central icon of a pagoda. That is, scriptural characters became lines and dots forming a painted image, and the image was in fact a meticulously designed text. Although the sutra highlights a visual picture at the price of certain textual legibility with its always tiny and tilted characters and discontinuous reading thread, the rigorousness of transcription of the sutra does not abates. Xiang Mu inscribes on the right bottom, “Before the sutra is delivered, the pagoda has already been erected. Now that to engrave the [image of the] pagoda is also to transcribe the sutra. Both the dharma and its phenomenal appearance are ready, and they are mutually constitutive. The diamond will never deteriorate, and thus stay fresh new over ten thousand years.

1615,Teuchitlan Tradition,43,Religious Group (v6),"Guachimontones es el asentamiento rector de un complejo cultural del occidente mesoamericano que se conoce bajo el concepto “La Tradición Teuchitlán”. El término fue acuñado por Weigand en 1993 en el que englobó evidencia arquitectónicas y materiales que definen a dicha sociedad. Ahora sabemos qué, más que una tradición, representa el resultado de un entrelazado de prácticas político-religiosas, económicas y cotidianas que forman una cultura compleja (Beekman y Weigand 2008; Blanco Morales 2010:6 Smith 2009; Weigand 1993). Las primicias de las investigaciones de Weigand y sus colaboradores afirmaron que el inicio, apogeo y declive de esta cultura sucedieron entre los años 200 y 400-500 d.C. (Weigand 1993), sin embargo, gracias a las extensas excavaciones que se realizaron a finales de la década de los años noventa e inicios del siglo XXI en el centro rector (Guachimontones/Loma Alta) y en el sitio de Navajas, se fechó quinientos años antes, es decir, entre los años 300 a.C. al 350/450 d.C. (Beekman y Weigand 2008:326-Fig. 9).

La sociedad, además del trabajo artesanal, la caza la pesca y recolección, practicó principalmente la agricultura, siendo sus cultivos principales el amaranto y maíz (Weigand 2008, Stuart 2003, 2005). Su sistema de creencias, aunque en una etapa joven de desarrollo, es el resultado de una tradición local, en donde emanan historias y conceptos que la ligan con el mundo ideológico y cosmológico del que resulta Mesoamérica (Blanco Morales 2012; Heredia y Englehardt 2016) definida por López Austin (1996; 2000) como ""Tradición Religiosa Mesoamericana"". 

Su connotación religiosa se puede vislumbrar en su arquitectura cívico-ceremonial y mortuoria (Blanco Morales 2009: 69-79; López Mestas, 2011; Ohnersorgen y Varien, 2008; Smith, 2009; Weigand 1992; 1993), así como en la iconografía plasmada en los objetos suntuarios. La armónica planeación y organización del espacio, junto con la presencia de especialización de materiales como obsidiana, concha y cerámica (Esparza 2004; Esparza y Tenorio 2004; López Mestas 2011; López Mestas 2005: 235; Weigand 1993; Weigand, García y Glascock 2004), y una posible especialización e intensificación agrícola vista a través de la agricultura hidráulica (Weigand, 1993; Stuart, 2005) explica la presencia de ciertos mecanismos reguladores a nivel regional y, por ende, un aparato organizativo que , mientras Weigand y otros autores lo definen como un estado incipiente (Weigand 1993), según Jorge Ramos y Lorenza López Mestas sugieren los indicios de un cacicazgo complejo (López Mestas y Ramos 2002, López Mestas 2011). Aún así, pese a disparidad entre dichas argumentaciones, en ambos casos la importancia religiosa como un medio conciliador y coercitivo no se descarta ya que resultaría elemental para el fortalecimiento de las interacciones entre los asentamientos del núcleo. Sin lugar a dudas, el patrón circular como escenario ritual, las canchas de juego de pelota en cada uno de los sitios principales, la práctica mortuoria que implicó la elaboración de tumbas de tiro (López Mestas y Ramos 2002; López Mestas 2011) y la adoración a los ancestros, dan certeza de las principales actividades cívico-religiosas de los habitantes del occidente mesoamericano hace cuando menos 2350 años.",-300,400,1833,1309,Ericka Sofia Blanco Morales,2022-12-30 22:39:35.364 +0100,2023-01-19 19:41:22.487 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1619,"Saint Nicholas ""Maroulenas"", Kastania, southern Greece, byzantine church",43,Religious Group (v6),"The small byzantine church of Saint Nicholas ""Maroulenas"" is a fine example of the single-nave cross-vaulted (or traverse-vault) architectural type, dated in 13th century. It is located in the village of Kastania, in the messinian Mani, the south-western part of Messinia region, in the Peloponnese, southern Greece. Numerous churches of byzantine to post byzantine times are preserved within the village, marking it as a particular regional religious center. ""Maroulena"" is believed to have been the name of the female resident who lived nearby the church and took care of it. Despite its limited size and humble aspirations, the church is decorated by fine murals, dated in the end of the 13th century. The iconographic program includes the depiction of Theotokos in the apse, scenes from the Life of Saint Nicholas and of Christ Passion, saint figures etc. Both in style and iconography,  conservatism and copying western trends are to be noticed.
The church was purposed to function most probably for private (a family) or limited number of faithful (the members of the quarter) gatherings. It remained in use officially till the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Ottomans, in 1460. In the 18th century, an era of local economic development, the church restored its religious function and was redecorated by few new murals.

1620,Temple of Ištar (Emašmaš) at Nineveh,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The temple of Ištar is located atop the Kouyunjik mound of ancient Nineveh, which is bounded by the Tigris river to the west and surrounded by the modern city of Mosul in Northern Iraq. By the second millennium BCE, it was referred to as Emašmaš. It is possible this name may in fact refer to a group of structures containing shrines to various deities in the immediate vicinity of the main temple. There is also a ziggurat dedicated to Ištar thought to be located southwest of Emašmaš complex. According to Šamši-Adad I (r.1808-1776 BCE), a temple was first built to Ištar in Nineveh by the Akkadian ruler Maništušu, which he then rebuilt on a monumental scale. There is limited archaeological evidence of earlier structures dated to the 3rd millennium BCE beneath the large platform Šamši-Adad built his new temple upon, one of which could have been built by Maništušu. From this point the temple entered into a long history of continued use, with many subsequent phases of reconstruction and renovation. These phases are well-attested for the Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian periods, where foundation inscriptions, bricks and wall-pegs found in the main temple area name and/or describe the building efforts of multiple kings, in particular: Aššur-uballiṭ I (r.1363-1328 BCE), Shalmaneser I (r.1263-1234 BCE), Tukulti-Ninurta I (r.1233-1197 BCE), Aššurnaṣirpal II (r. 883-859 BCE), Sennacherib (r.704-681 BCE), and Aššurbanipal (r. 668-631 BCE). There may have been earlier Old Assyrian/Babylonian and Mittani presence at Kouyunjik as well, but it is unclear to what extent Nineveh was directly incorporated into these polities. Limited cuneiform records and archaeological evidence do exist pertaining to activities at Nineveh from these periods; for instance, Hammurapi of Babylon mentions his pious works in Emašmaš on his famous stele. Depending on who controlled Nineveh at the time, the goddess occupying the temple may have been equated with Šauška, a Hurrian goddess (early 2nd millennium BCE), Mullissu, the wife of Aššur (Neo-Assyrian period), or with Sumerian Inana or Ninlil. As the daughter of Sîn and sister to Šamaš, Ištar is a main goddess of the Mesopotamian pantheon, with roles in war, fertility/sex, and nature. 

The temple itself is not fully excavated due to surface erosion on its eastern side, and understanding its stratigraphy is quite difficult, considering that areas of the temple proper had been demolished and rebuilt at variable depths throughout its history. In general, the temple was a rectangular building built upon a mudbrick platform, containing an inner and outer courtyard, the outer of which was bounded by a series of rooms on its northwest, southwest, and southeast sides. Its main entrance is thought to be from the northwest via a monumental gate flanked with stone statues of lions, which are the attribute animal of Ištar. As collateral damage in the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian empire in 612 BCE, the temple was extensively burned, its fragmented materials used for building later structures on the site.",-1800,-612,1838,1202,Glynnis Maynard,2023-01-04 16:39:47.018 +0100,2023-01-05 21:15:24.240 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1621,"Saint Spyridon,Kardamyli, southern Greece, postbyzantine church",43,Religious Group (v6),"The church of Saint Spyridon is located in Kardamyli, at the fortified compound of the Mourtzinoi-Troupakis local clan (local landlords called kapetanioi), in the region of messinian Mani, Peloponnese, southern Greece.

1624,Neo-Assyrian Healers (āšipu/mašmaššu-exorcists),43,Religious Group (v6),"The exorcist (Akkadian āšipu/mašmaššu) acted in an intellectual community as one of five main scholarly professions throughout the Neo-Assyrian period. Exorcists were primarily concerned with medical and magical healing, as well as diagnosing causes of illness, for private - and frequently highborn - clients. Furthermore, they could perform rituals for the city, temples, and the court. Accordingly, they were often connected to the royal court, as well as official and religious institutions in various cities. However, exorcists were not priests. Among the tools of their trade were numerous rituals, medical remedies, prayers, and incantations. Exorcists in the Neo-Assyrian period did not distinguish between what we today label as “magic” and “medicine”, instead believing that most illnesses were caused by supernatural forces, such as gods or demons. Once a patient was seized by an illness, healing could be achieved through identifying the ailment and the agent causing the malady, and subsequently applying therapeutic or ritual treatments to cure the illness and its symptoms, as well as ritual actions to appease the god in question. Healing therefore consisted of both medical and magical treatments, and the term encapsulates the combined focus in the exorcist’s methods for diagnosing and treating illness as well as ensuring social, physical, or mental wellbeing. Although an exorcist’s duties partially overlapped with those of the physician (asû) and diviner (bārû), the exorcist appears to have been the primary professional practicing a broad selection of traditional Assyrian and Babylonian healing methods in the Neo-Assyrian period. Accordingly, the translation “exorcist” is inadequate and often incorrect in describing his competences and duties. The majority of sources from this period can be dated roughly to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, and they were excavated in the royal text collections at Nineveh, a temple library in Kalhu (Nimrud), private libraries in Assur (especially the “Haus des Beschwörungspriesters”), and a private text collection from Huzirina (Sultantepe).",-900,-612,582,1132,Troels Pank Arbøll,2023-01-06 11:21:20.969 +0100,2023-01-17 13:21:21.264 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1625,Zhu Xi's Four Books 朱熹四書,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Four Books, namely the Great Learning (Da xue 大學),  the Doctrine of the Mean (Zhong yong 中庸), the Analects (Lun yu 論語), and the Mencius (Meng zi 孟子), is a compendium of essential Confucian readings compiled, edited, annotated, and systematically interpreted by Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200 CE), the eminent Southern Song scholar and chief architect of Neo-Confucianism. It is recognized as the most fundamental canon of Neo-Confucianism and marks the climax of this intellectual movement that aims to “reexamine, rediscover, reinterpret, redefine, revitalize and reinforce” the Confucian heritage. (James T.C. Liu, 1973, p.483). About one century after Zhu Xi’s death, when the Mongolian Yuan emperor Renzong (r.1311–1320 CE) issued a decree to reintroduce the imperial examination (keju kaoshi 科舉考試)  system for government recruitment in 1313 CE, he assigned Zhu Xi’s edition of the Four Books, Sishu zhangju jizhu 四書章句集注 (The Collected Commentaries of the Chapters and Verses of the Four Books, below SSZJJZ), as the basic curriculum of the imperial examination. As a result, SSZJJZ became the base of state orthodoxy and remained so for the following six hundred years till the imperial examination system was terminated in 1919. In this sense, there is no other Chinese classic that has had a greater influence on Chinese thought and life than Zhu Xi’s Four Books.

Among the Four Books, the Analects and Mencius had circulated separately before the twelfth century. The other two “books” are chapters selected by Zhu Xi from the Book of Rites (Liji, 禮記), one of the Five Classics (wujing 五經). But all of the four texts have seen some extent of “ascendancy” as they became part of the Four Books. The Analects, which collects Confucius’ own words and his disciples’ remarks about the Master, had always been considered essential in rudimentary education but never made it into the Classics. (Some scholars believe the “Seven Classics” in the Eastern Han includes the Analects, but others doubt whether the phrase even refers to Confucian canons as it may refer to a group of Daosit or Buddhist scripts.) Mencius used to be merely one of the pre-Qin “masters' books” (zishu 子書) but gradually gained more attention from the mid-Tang and onward. Leading Confucian scholars of previous generations had already noticed the hermeneutic potentials in these four groups of texts— especially the Mencius and the Doctrine of the Mean— in purifying and revitalizing the Confucian heritage, but it was in Zhu Xi’s hands that they were first combined together, prioritized in the Confucian teaching, given a systematic and coherent interpretation, and became the Four Books— a new Confucian canon and the pivot of the renewed tradition that would surpass the Five Classics to constitute the foundation of state orthodoxy. 

Before the Tang, the curriculum in the Imperial Academy (taixue 太學) was based on the Five Classics (wujing 五經)：The Book of Poetry (Shi 詩), The Book of Documents (Shu 書), The Book of Rites, The Book of Music (Yue 樂), Spring and Autumn Annals (Chun qiu 春秋). A few other texts, such as The Analects, The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiao jing 孝經), and Er-ya (“The Literary Expositor” 爾雅) were used as auxiliary books especially for elementary education. The education at this time aimed at cultivating students’ (most of them aristocratic) Six Arts (liuyi 六藝): ceremonies (li 禮), music (yue 樂), archery (she 射), carriage-driving (yu 御), writing (shu 書), mathematics (shu 數). The pre-Tang tradition’s emphasis on the value of institution, ritual, and cultural conventions is also seen in its promotion of the parallel of “Duke of Zhou and Confucius”. This model assigns the same supreme status as Confucius to the Duke of Zhou, one of the de facto rulers in early Zhou dynasty and a seminal figure in establishing the political and cultural institutions that would impact Chinese civilization for thousands of years to come. 

Almost all the aforementioned characteristics of pre-Tang Confucian tradition were transformed during and after the Song. Individuals’ moral cultivation replaced the establishment of social and cultural institutions to become the most valued as the cultural synthesis had collapsed. The greatest Confucian enterprise changed from building an “external kingdom” (waiwang 外王) to attaining “inner sagehood” (neisheng 內聖). The ultimate cultural heroes, accordingly, had also changed from the parallel of “the Duke of Zhou and Confucius” to that of “Confucius and Mencius,” the lesser sage (yasheng 亞聖) who brought about the discussions about the Four Cardinal Virtues/Beginnings (siduan 四端) that he believed were innate to humans and thus sparked off a long debate over human nature in Chinese history. 

But the most noticeable transformation from the Han-Tang Confucian doctrine to its renewed model in and after the Song till the rise of the Evidential Studies (kaoju xue 考據學) in the eighteenth century is the formulation of the idea of li 理 (Principle/ Pattern/ Coherence/ Moral Law) — where the term li xue 理學 (the Learning of Principle, or, Neo-Confucianism) comes from — and the full-blown development of Neo-Confucian hermeneutics anchored to this idea. Among all the Song dynasty Neo-Confucian philosophers Zhu Xi alone emphasizes the autonomy of knowledge and the importance of book learning to the attainment of li (or dao, the Way 道), Zhu Xi with his study of the Four Books provides a systematic methodology about it, which is precisely the area wherein lies one of his monumental contributions to the Neo-Confucian learning (Yu, 2016).

The notion of li was first raised to the metaphysical level and given an ontological sense by the Cheng brothers in the eleventh century. It’s defined as the substance of nature and the fundamental moving cause of myriad things. The Cheng brothers also developed the Neo-Confucian epistemology centered around the question of how we, as subjective individuals with limited cognitive faculties, could study the Principle to the utmost (qiong li 窮理) and bring our innate moral nature to its fulfillment (jin xing 盡性). Zhu Xi inherited the Cheng brothers’ learning of li and further enhanced its metaphysical profundity by incorporating it with other Northern Song Confucian thinkers’ cosmological studies. He also made the Neo-Confucian interpretations of li more tenable in their competition against the increasingly popular Chan School of Buddhism, the teaching of which is characterized by vacuity and its disbelief of the existence of a concrete, good and eternal entity. 

Li as an ontological concept is interchangeable in various contexts with a few other Confucian notions including dao (the Way 道), taiji (the Supreme Ultimate 太極), xing (Nature of man and things 性), xin (mind-heart 心, here refers to the Moral Mind-heart daoxin 道心 rather than its contaminated version, the fallible renxin 人心). Zhu Xi articulates that li is identical to dao and taiji; and it is called (human) Nature in relation to the mind-heart and Principle in relation to events and things (zai xin huanzuo xing, zai shi huanzuo li. 在心喚做性, 在事喚做理). Some scholars have found li comparable to the Aristotlian notion of form in the field of nature and to the Platonic idea of goodness in the field of moral value (Chang, 1956, pp.255–56), whereas others caution against such comparison as the usual Western polarities do not apply in Chinese philosophy (Chan, 1963, p.641). 

The Neo-Confucianists claim that this li does not exist for itself, thus the celebrated dictum of li yi fen shu (the Principle is one but the manifestations are many. 理一分殊). With Zhu Xi, each thing (wu wu 物物) and each person (ren ren 人人) in this phenomenal world is endowed with one/the same li or one/the same taiji. He often uses the metaphor of moon and its reflections in rivers and lakes to explain why the one li does not split up into parts while being within infinite particularities. As many have noted, this analogy is borrowed, though indirectly, from the Buddhist Huayan School’s doctrine of one and many. But the real crux of the matter here is how the myriad manifestations of li— this eternal and highest goodness— are involved with conflicts, imbalance, and all kinds of deviation from the Mean (zhong yong 中庸) when it leaves the state of tranquility (that is, wei fa 未發, before it becomes active) and enters the state of differentiation as activity takes place (yi fa 已發), and how this problem of evil or badness could be solved.

To respond to such a query that is perennial and universal to almost all religions and traditions of thought, the Neo-Confucians introduced the notion of qizhi zhi xing (physical nature 氣質之性. Relevant terms include qi or qi bing, material force/ material endowment 氣/氣稟). This notion was first brought into discussion by Zhu Xi’s eleventh century predecessors (primarily Zhang Zai 張載 and Chengyi 程頤) then got fully elaborated in Zhu’s system. According to Zhu Xi, it is not sufficient to simply blame the rising of badness on an individual's wrong choice— as Mencius does; nor is it proper to be ascribed to feelings (qing 情) — as the Tang Confucians do, because he believes qing buds from its roots of moral nature. The propensity to deviate from the Mean is actually attendant in each individual’s endowment of physical nature. This does not mean however the physical nature as such is evil itself. It means that within the physical nature there is the occasion for badness. And how to use this occasion, Zhu Xi claims, depends on man.

This is why the Four Books is assigned such an essential and fundamental role in Zhu Xi’s entire teaching. He believes that reading keeps one’s mind from indulging in empty speculations and keeps it in a desirable state of jing (serious, attentive, alert 敬). It’s only with this attitude of jing that one can prevent their nature from lapsing into laxity, avoid being controlled by the damaging material force, be able to preserve (cun 存) and cultivate (yang 養) their moral mind, and finally achieve sagehood and attain the Way. Therefore, book knowledge always precedes any practice or action in the systematic methodology Zhu Xi designed to achieve the above goals— not necessarily in the sense of importance but in the sense of order. 

All of these hermeneutic and methodological changes of Confucianism were institutionalized in the aforementioned 1313 decree. Such a model transformation from the Han-Tang Confucianism to the (post-) Song Neo-Confucianism, as stated in earlier passages, was not initiated by Zhu Xi. The learning of the eleventh century dao xue (the Learning of the Way 道學) scholars had laid the foundation for Zhu Xi’s creative and comprehensive work. But as the chief architect of Neo-Confucianism and especially the founder of “study of the Four Books” (sishu xue 四書學), Zhu Xi is reckoned by many as the most crucial thinker in the intellectual lineage that consummated this transformation (Qian, 1982, vol.4, pp.180-81), or what Thomas S.

Evidence for Hera being worshipped as a goddess of the sea is derived from an interdisciplinary approach; the votive assemblages from her sanctuaries, of which at least 7 are seaside, her symbolic and material connections to the sea and water, and myths she is involved in. As a goddess of the sea, Hera was the recipient of at least 46 ship models discovered in a religious context and hundreds of other votives associated with maritime imagery. It is clear that she was worshipped in practical matters of seafaring, such as being prayed to for a safe journey or ideal weather conditions. However, there is also evidence for her maritime cult in a broader, instinctual, symbolic connection with the sea, related to aspects of creation, motherhood, liminality, and transitional spaces.",-800,-400,1852,1131,Kaitlyn Skinner,2023-01-10 08:37:32.400 +0100,2023-01-31 02:16:20.991 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1627,Mount Putuo 普陀山,43,Religious Group (v6),"Made up of elite and non-elite pilgrims, imperial patrons, and monks, devotees of Guanyin legitimated Mount Putuo as a sacred site as well as the home of the Bodhisattva. Not part of a codified sect of religious practitioners, this group helped domesticate Guanyin at Mount Putuo while also establishing it as the mytical potalaka from the Huayan (Flower Garland) Sutra.

Potalaka (補陀落山) refers to the home of the Bodhisattva who perceives the world's sounds (Guānshìyīn 观世音 -- the Chinese translation of Avalokiteśvara). Compared to other Buddhist pilgrimage sites, Mount Putuo's emergence as a national and international place of pilgrimage was late. It began in the tenth century, and in the 16th century gained more traction. It was after the 18th century that it reached its peak in popularity. 

Other famous Buddhist mountains, such as Mounts Wutai and Emei were popularized during the Tang Dynasty. For Putuo, trade at the location was important for its establishment, as were miracle tales. Stories that located Guanyin at the site, and connected the mountain with the notion of potalaka, helped build the site as a Buddhist pilgrimage destination. Miracle tales have been essential for Mount Putuo's development, as they provided the mystique that draws in visitors. As Marcus Bingenheimer (2016) notes in his examination of Mount Putuo gazetteers, in the Ming and Qing eras, tales of supernatural events occurring at Mount Putuo were part of the religious 'imaginaire' regarding the site. These included accounts of individuals receiving a vision of the Bodhisattva, plus efficacious wonders (miracles) performed by Guanyin. The work by Chün-fang Yü (2001) regarding Guanyin and Mount Putuo further confirms the importance of miracle tales in sacralizing Mount Putuo as the home of Guanyin. 

Throughout its history, the location has been shaped by government impositions on religion, military activities, elite (literati) and non-elite pilgrims, and national and international trade.

In the modern era, Mount Putuo has been greatly influenced by economic investments in religious sites. Each of China's four Buddhist mountains has a government-operated tourism corporation, and the Mount Putuo Tourism Development Company is one example of the kind of corporatization that shapes Chinese Buddhism today. Tourism development companies function as private operators, but they are officially state-owned. Thus, although the Chinese government is an atheist state, it is a patron of Buddhism. After the death of Mao, reforms regarding religious and economic policies occurred, and in 1982, religious policy began protecting five legal religions -- Buddhism, Daoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam. Throughout Chinese Buddhism's history, financial donations from laity, as well as donations of land, have supported monastic communities and temples, but since the 1990s, local governments have also become donors of Buddhism through their support and initiation of building or rebuilding of Buddhist sites. Local governments are interested in these efforts for the economic benefits that can come from tourism. 

Interestingly, even in its contemporary setting, Mount Putuo's miracle tales are significant for its identity. In current tourism advertisements, miracle tales are used to draw in visitors, and tourist organizations promote the site for its efficacious mystique. Thus even within state-sponsored tourism, the location is a center for encountering Buddhist culture and the Bodhisattva Guanyin.",1978,2023,1842,978,Courtney Bruntz,2023-01-10 20:13:49.797 +0100,2023-03-27 22:21:30.013 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1628,Bad' al-Khalq wa Qasas al-Anbiya' of Kisa'i كتاب بدء الخلق وقصص الأنبياء للكسائي,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Le livre ""Le début de la création et les histoires des prophètes"" d'al-Kisa'i a fait l'objet de quatre enquêtes, dont trois ont été imprimées.
Ces investigations expriment la difficulté à déterminer l'auteur du livre et l'époque de sa rédaction.
L'enquête la plus récente du livre est celle que Bandar Al-Zaidi a déposée dans le cadre d'un Master des études religieuse dans une université saoudienne.
Avant l'enquête de Bandar Al-Zaidi, on retrouve l'édition de Beyrouth avec un très mauvais travail de Khaled Abdel-Fattah Shebl en 2004. Avant cela, le Dr Al-Taher Bin Salama avait suggéré une enquête sur le livre dans le cadre de son doctorat, son ouvrage a été publié en 1998. Quant à la quatrième enquête, qui est la plus ancienne, elle a été réalisée par l'orientaliste allemand Einsenberg et publiée en 1922.
Ces enquêtes donnent quatre exemplaires du livre d'al-Kisa'i et sa personnalité. Chaque édition faisait référence à un auteur et définissait pour lui une époque différente des autres éditions, et fournissait un titre au livre différent des autres titres.
L'édition d'Eisenberg avait comme titre ""Histoires des prophètes."" Elle est attribuée à Abu Hamza al-Kisa'i, le linguiste, professeur d'al-Amin et d'al-Ma'mun, décédé en 179, 180 ou 189 AH (795 , 796 CE ou 805 CE).
Le travail de at-Taher bin Salma s'intitule ""Le début de la création et les histoires des prophètes par al-Kisa'i."" L'auteur de l'enquête a suggéré que al-Kisa'i vivait dans le sixième siècle AH (12 CE).
Le titre de la copie du Dar Al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah est ""Histoires et naissances des prophètes."" Elle prétend que al-Kisa'i est mort en l'an 1234 AH (1818 AD).
Quant à l'enquête de Bandar Al-Zaidi, elle s'intitule ""Le livre du commencement et les histoires des prophètes, que la paix et les bénédictions soient sur eux."" Il l'attribue à la même personnalité que at-Taher bin Salma, à savoir Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Kisa'i, mais il précise l'époque à laquelle il a vécu entre 250 et 350 AH (864-961 CE).
La vérité est que la déclaration d'Eisenberg et la précision de Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah sont incorrectes.
Al-Kisa'i se réfère dans son livre, dans de nombreux cas, à Ibn 'Asaker, l'auteur de l'Histoire de Damas, décédé en l'an 571 AH (1176 CE), il n'est donc pas possible que la personne visée soit al-Kisa'i Abu Hamzah le linguiste décédé avant Ibn 'Asaker de près de 4 siècle. Al-Qurtubi, dans son interprétation du Coran, se réfère au livre d'al-Kisa'i verbalement, il le dit : ""Son miracle a été mentionné dans ce que al-Kisa'i a mentionné dans les histoires de les prophètes… » Al-Qurtubi est mort en l'an 631 AH (1234 ُِ), il n'est donc pas possible que al-Kisa'i, qui nous intéresse, soit celui mentionné par Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah. Quant à at-Taher bin Salma et Vadet, ils précisent deux dates proches pour la mort de l'auteur, le Ve siècle AH (11 CE) pour Vadet et le VIe siècle AH (12 CE) pour Bin Salma.
La période pendant laquelle Al-Kisa'i a vécu s'étend sur les sixième et septième siècles, avec une forte probabilité qu'il ait vécu entre l'année 571 AH, l'année de la mort d'Ibn Asaker, et l'année 617 AH , la date du plus ancien exemplaire de son livre, ce qui signifie qu'il est contemporain d'historiens et de commentateurs de premier plan, dont les plus célèbres sont Ibn Al-Jawzi, Ibn Al-Atheer et Al-Qurtubi...
Nous pouvons en apprendre davantage sur la zone géographique dans laquelle Al-Kisa'i a vécu en regardant les emplacements des copies manuscrites de son livre.
Ben Salma travaillait sur seize exemplaires manuscrits, tous répartis entre Tunis et Paris, cependant il attribut au dernier exemplaire, le nom de ""l'exemplaire de Damas"".
Les exemplaires de Paris sont des exemplaires originaux conservés à la Bibliothèque Nationale de Tunisie.
La plupart des copies de Paris ont été écrites en écriture orientale, ce qui suggère fortement qu'elles ont été écrites au proche orient. Bin Salama a mentionné que les copies les plus anciennes, qui ont été copiées en l'an 877 AH, ont été vues par ""Botrus Diab al-Halabi, le traducteur du sultan de France en l'an mil six cent soixante-dix chrétiens"", correspondant à l'année 1081 AH.
La plupart des copies étaient associées à Damas, et il n'est pas exclu en ce qui concerne le reste des copies à Paris ou en Tunisie qu'elles soient originaires de Syrie en raison des relations étroites que l'Empire français entretenait avec la Syrie et l'orient.
Ces observations nous amènent à une conclusion importante: Damas en particulier et l'orient en général sont le berceau dans lequel le livre a été écrit.",1100,2023,1843,1225,Ali Makhlabi,2023-01-12 17:33:04.357 +0100,2023-02-01 23:17:40.405 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Des années, et il était l'un des compagnons les plus importants du Messager qui l'a aidé dans l'appel à l'islam. Le Messager l'a nommé calife de Médine lors de la bataille de Badr, de la bataille de Bani Qaynuqa et de la Bataille d'As-Suwaiq en l'an 2 AH. En l'an 5 AH, il regretta d'avoir violé l'ordre du Prophète lorsque les Juifs de Banu Qurayzah menacèrent de les tuer pour avoir insisté sur l'incrédulité après que le verset d'Al-Anfal puis le verset de la repentance aient été révélés (103.

À ce moment-là, le Messager a desserré son lien et lui a pardonné, alors Abu Lubabah a déclaré son abandon de ce qu'il avait et a émigré, se consacrant au ""jihad dans la voie de Dieu."" Après la mort du Messager, il a rejoint l'armée musulmane. qui a été formé par Khalid bin Al-Walid, qui est allé à la guerre d'apostasie à Yamama pour combattre Musaylimah, puis en Irak, au Levant, en Palestine et en Égypte, et il a assisté à la conquête de Damas et à la guerre de Yarmouk, après quoi il est venu à Ifriqiya (Tunisie) sous le califat d'Othman Ibn Affan, et il est décédé sous le règne de l'Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib en 50 A.H, à l'âge d'environ 80 ans dans un lieu appelé Wadi al-Ghiran dans la région de Marath. a été transféré par la suite sur la colline d'Abi Lababa dans la ville de Gabès, où se trouve son sanctuaire actuel, pour glorifier sa carrière dans l'appel à l'Islam et maintenant

1632,Temple-Church of Aphrodisias,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Aphrodisias is a UNESCO World Heritage site located near modern Geyre in southwestern Turkey. Although prehistoric human activity is attested at the site, the city proper was founded in the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE, rising up around the sanctuary of Aphrodite, the city's namesake goddess. Aphrodisias became part of the Roman Empire in the late 1st century BCE and enjoyed a period of growth and prosperity. In the 3rd century CE, the city became capital of the province of Caria, which was followed by a building boom.

A small Christian presence existed in Aphrodisias by the end of the 3rd century CE, as a number of martyrs are attested from around the year 300. By 325, the city had its own bishop. Around the year 500 (dated from coins excavated from the foundation of the outer narthex), the temple of Aphrodite was converted into a Christian church.  The temple was essentially turned 'inside out': the cella walls were dismantled and rebuilt as the outer walls of the church, supplemented with spolia from elsewhere in the city. The columns from the eastern and western colonnades were moved to align with the north and south rows, creating a large tripartite church with an apse to the east and narthexes at the west. This conversion was a massive physical and logistical effort, undertaken in a systematic, strategic, and precise manner--column drums from the east and west colonnades were labeled for their exact re-erection. In the 10th or 11th century, the church was renovated: new floors were laid, a small chapel was constructed in the north aisle, a new sanctuary barrier was installed, and new paintings of Christ, Mary, archangels, saints/martyrs, and crosses were added in the synthronon passageway. The church was ultimately destroyed by fire in the late 12th century, likely a casualty of ongoing Seljuk raids in the Maeander valley. The archaeological evidence indicates that it remained in use until its destruction.",450,1199,1849,1260,Elizabeth Davis,2023-01-27 20:58:45.472 +0100,2023-03-02 23:23:58.361 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1635,The 'Parastaseis Syntomoi Chronikai',52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Parastaseis Syntomoi Chronikai is an eighth or ninth century patriographic text which records brief notes on the examples of monumental Greco-Roman statuary of Constantinople and the numinous powers imputed to them. The exact circumstances and date of its composition, the identity of its author (or authors), and its purpose and genre remain subjects of contention among scholars.  It preserves an image of Constantinople at a particular time in its history; the landscape which emerges is a scarcely-inhabited ruin, overgrown and dotted with enigmatic images invested with power in an antique time, and often filled with curious ex votos; tablets with riddlesome inscriptions, skeletons, strange figurines. Nevertheless, it arguably offers the student of Byzantine religion an opportunity to study the beliefs and powers imputed to Greco-Roman Statues in the medieval period. Moreover, as a text likely composed during the period of Iconoclasm (or just before it) it is notable that it concerns images, and, indeed, argues for their potency and importance (it is notable that even in the case of statues which work maleficent magic, the text cautions against destroying or molesting them). Furthermore, the wholesale reproduction of the Parastaseis in the widely-circulated tenth-century Patria, attests to continued engagement with the text as the centuries wore on.",700,900,1400,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-01-31 03:03:37.705 +0100,2023-02-16 20:28:35.774 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1636,The second phase of the Iconoclastic Controversy,43,Religious Group (v6),"On October 13, 787 the Second Council of Nicaea decreed that the venerable and Holy Icons are to be dedicated in the holy churches of God, namely the image of our Lord and God and Savior Jesus Christ, of our immaculate Lady the Holy Theotokos (Virgin Mary), and of the angels and all the saints. They are to be accorded the veneration of honor, not indeed the true worship paid to the divine nature alone, but in the same way, as this is accorded to the life-giving cross, the holy gospels, and other sacred offerings. Few years after that decree, Emperor Leo V the Armenian, a senior general who assumed the throne of the Byzantine Empire, after forcing his predecessor, Michael I Rangabe, to resign in 813, launched a second period of Iconoclasm in 815. Leo’s motivations were perhaps the military failures, that were regarded as indicators of divine displeasure. The Byzantines had suffered a series of humiliating defeats at the hands of the Bulgarians, in the course of which emperor Nikephoros I (802-811) had been killed in battle and emperor Michael I Rangabe had been forced to abdicate. Soon after his accession, Leo V began to discuss the possibility of reviving iconoclasm with a variety of people, including priests, monks, and members of the senate, stating that any of the previous emperors, who embraced the veneration of the Holy Icons, met their death either in revolt or in war; but those who did not venerate images all died a natural death, remained in power until they died, and were then laid to rest with all honors in the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles. His next move was to appoint a committee of monks to look into the old books and reach a decision on the veneration of the Holy Icons. They soon discovered the acts of the Iconoclastic Synod, summoned by the Emperor Constantine V in 754 in the palace of Hieria at Chalcedon. The council supported the emperor's iconoclast position in the Byzantine iconoclasm controversy, condemning the spiritual and liturgical use of iconography as heretical. A debate between Leo's supporters and the clergy who continued to advocate the veneration of the Holy Icons, led by the Patriarch Nikephoros I (806-815), had no resolution, so Leo was convinced that his policy was correct and had the icon of the Chalke gate, which Leo III is fictitiously claimed to have removed once before, replaced with a cross. In 815 the revival of iconoclasm was rendered official by a Synod held in the Hagia Sophia. After the death of Leo V, Michael II the Amorian (820-829) succeeded him. In a letter to the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious, in 824, Michael lamented the appearance of image veneration in the church and such practices as making icons baptismal godfathers to infants. He confirmed the decrees of the Iconoclast Council of 754. Michael was succeeded by his son, Theophilus, who died leaving his wife Theodora the Armenian or the Blessed regent for his minor heir, Michael III the Drunkard (842-867). Albeit nearly all bishops of the empire had been forced to profess Iconoclasm, the Empress had considerable support and managed to restore the veneration of the Holy Icons in March 843, just fourteen months after her husband’s death, putting thus an end to the second phase of Byzantine Iconoclasm. In order to counteract opposition and save the legacy of her late husband, she claimed that Theophilos had repented of Iconoclasm on his deathbed, a story that could also ensure that Theophilos's iconoclasm would not affect her son’s reign in the future. Furthermore, the iconoclast Patriarch of Constantinople, John VII Grammaticus (837-843), was deposed and replaced with the iconophile Methodios I (843-847). The entire process was conducted in relative peace, though the Patriarch at first refused to leave his residence and showed wounds on his stomach that he claimed had been inflicted by imperial guards. Soon after becoming Patriarch, Methodios had nearly every bishop in the empire deposed due to their opposition to the Second Council of Nicaea. On 11 March 843, the restoration of the icons was celebrated in a grand procession in the Hagia Sophia. The day of Theodora's assembly and restoration of the Holy Icons has been celebrated ever since as the Feast of Orthodoxy.",814,823,1626,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-01-31 09:04:00.309 +0100,2023-02-02 11:09:16.654 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1640,Great Temple of Hattusa,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Great Temple, also known as Temple I, was built by the Hittites around 1600 BCE at their capital city Hattuša, located by the modern day town of Boğazkale in the central Anatolia region of Turkey. It is by far the largest of over 30 temples uncovered within the city. The Great Temple was probably referred to as the “Great House” in Hittite texts. Like all of the temples of Hattuša, it belonged to the Hittite state cult that served to the royal administration and was not open to the public. Without any major structural modifications, the temple was in use for four centuries until the end of the Hittite empire in the early years of the 12th century BCE. It appears to have been already emptied and abandoned prior to the destruction by fire. The temple complex is built on artificial terraces in the area called Lower City and is mainly composed of three structures: (1) the temple proper, (2) surrounding storerooms, and (3) an administrative building in the south area. All together they cover an area of 200 m by 130 m (about 6.5 acres). A building on the east side named “House on the Slope” may also have a functional association with the complex. Today, the only remains are the foundations, the human-high base blocks of the walls, and massive door thresholds.  Nothing remains of the upper structures that were built of unfired mud-bricks enforced with wood. The temple was probably a single-story structure estimated to be about 5-meters-high, while the storerooms built on lower terraces for the most part had two-, and at the northern end probably three-stories. The temple had 49 rooms of various sizes that surround a courtyard which was entered through a gateway at the southwest end. The largest two rooms, the double adyta, at the northeast end of the temple were accessed from the courtyard by passing through a pillared portico and a couple of small auxiliary rooms, and are believed to have served as the cult rooms for the two top deities of the Hittite pantheon, the Storm God of Hatti and the Sun Goddess of Arinna. Built of dark green gabbro blocks, these two rooms are distinguished from the white limestone of the rest of the temple. While the west adyton is largely destroyed, remains of a stone base that can be seen in the eastern adyton must have been where the cult statue of the deity was placed. Furthermore, five or six other rooms of the temple were likely to have been cult rooms of other major deities of the pantheon. All cult rooms were innermost sanctuaries that could be accessed only by a select few that included the royal family and the priests. In contrast to the Mesopotamian or Egyptian temples, there were several windows that illuminated the cult rooms and the cult statues, although this was probably controlled with wooden shutters on them. The storerooms surrounding the temple numbered at least 200 with the upper stories and were mostly served as depots for various types of goods. Several large pithoi were found in situ, some with a capacity of 2000 liters. Thousands of inscribed clay tablets, mostly fragmented, were recovered from eastern storerooms. The annex building to the south must have been the administrative center of the temple. A text that has been associated with this structure refers to it as the “house of work” and lists over 200 personnel.",-1600,-1180,1854,1019,Tayfun Bilgin,2023-02-02 03:06:45.384 +0100,2023-04-22 03:30:15.930 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1643,Kongzhai Shrine of the Robe and Cap of Confucius in Shanghai,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"A place called Kongzhai (Kong Residence), located in a once-rural area that is now within the borders of metropolitan Shanghai, formerly had a shrine for venerating Confucius (Kongzi / Master Kong) that was premised on the belief that a much later descendant had buried the ancient master's robe, cap, and jade ornaments there.  Far from the region in North China where Confucius had lived or traveled and over 1000 years after his death, the alleged burial of these relics inspired local late Ming literati to construct a temple complex, centered on an above-ground ""Tomb of the Robe and Cap"" and a sacrificial hall with sculptural icons.  At its height in the early Qing period, Kongzhai's structures, assorted visual images, and ritual artifacts supported its claim to be “Little Queli,” a surrogate for the primordial temple, cemetery, and mansion of Confucius's Kong descendants in Qufu, Shandong. Scholars gathered there to experience his beneficent aura, and sacrifices to Confucius were performed with the same liturgy as in the official Confucian temples attached to government schools.  Ambitious officials and local literati used their patronage and interactions with Kongzhai to enhance their own prestige and that of the humble locality.  Eventually a line of Kong descendants was designated to take charge of sacrifices, as at other places where descendants had settled.  Kongzhai's fortunes declined in the 19th century, and the fall of the Qing dynasty delegitimized Confucian ritualism. In the 20th century, Kongzhai became a target of Maoist campaigns against feudalism, superstition, and undesirable social classes, and it was conclusively destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.

1645,A Sogdian Zoroastrian Epitaph,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The group in question comprises Sogdian merchants in 6th century Chang'an, whose tomb monuments display Zoroastrian motifs. Several such monuments are funerary beds, with panels on the inside faces depicting the life of the deceased merchant; the tomb under review here is a sarcophagus in the shape of a Chinese-style house, with biographic panels along the outside walls.  
Sogdian traders had been travelling along the so-called Silk Roads to China and India since at least the 3rd century CE, and established themselves in several oasis cities along both the northern and southern routes. Not all were Zoroastrian; iconography and textual materials from various sites also indicate  that some were Buddhist, Manichaean or ""Nestorian"" Christian. Wirkak's sarcophagus includes pictorial themes that could also relate to Buddhist and/or Manichaean ideology. The judgment scene on the eastern wall appears, however, to be definitively ""Sogdian Zoroastrian,"" with some Chinese aesthetic elements . Reference to the couple going on to ""the best existence"" in the epitaph confirms this reading. 
Other tombs from a similar period belonging to Sogdian elite (several identified as ""sabao"" - that is a Sogdian community leader in a Chinese city) also indicate the Sogdian adaptation of disposal of the (excarnated, dried) bones in a carved ossuary to local Chinese burial practice.",494,579,1859,1135,Jenny Rose,2023-02-06 22:51:33.444 +0100,2023-06-14 16:19:26.595 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1647,Gregory of Nyssa’s oration 40,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This oration was written and preached for the catechumens who used to postpone their baptismal practice, at risk of losing their salvation, heaven, and a life free from sin, according to Gregory of Nyssa. This oration is part of a larger body of catechetical works, that try to proselytize new Christians and preach the word of Jesus Christ.
	It is common in the fourth century to meet orations like Gregory’s; the early church did not have the political and social power it wished for and, therefore, it managed to find ways to make its presence bolder and stronger. Thus, orations like this one, would contribute to a better understanding of Christianity as well as to proselytize new members of the Christian community effortlessly.
The holy baptism of the catechumens is indicated picturesquely in Gregory of Nyssa's orations. Gregory of Nyssa indicates baptism as a medicine: a medicine that cures all the sins of the body and the soul.  Water is a healing material and a process of the body’s cure and rebirth. Water was always necessary for the baptismal practice, as it is been holy since Jesus’ baptism.  It is an integral part of baptism to pray.  Praying was an act of salvation and dialogue with God. The baptism prayer is placed with the baptism, for the baptismist, the baptized, and the people around.
The word “Baptist” brings our attention to this point.  Were there still Baptists in the fourth century? Or Gregory implicates the work of the priest as a Baptist? That remains unknown in this oration. There is a phenomenon in late antiquity of the laic baptizing catechumens, mostly in emergencies (e.g., in the case of a lethal disease). However, Gregory of Nyssa does not elaborate on these roles exactly in his oration on baptism. What we do see in Gregory's work is an appeal for baptism in case of sudden death, which leads us to examine life expectancy in late antiquity, as we will see later.  
Gregory's oration addresses those who delay baptism. We can conclude the fact that the catechumens were not convinced easily to be baptized, especially when they were healthy. Gregory refers to them as “slaves of the sin”. Using the example of a catechumen who baptized himself with all the waters of nature right before his violent death, he illustrates the importance of baptism with all the waters of nature.  This example confirms the fact that the emotion that led the catechumens into baptism is fear, just as when the plague hit in Justinian's time when people sought help and the blessing of baptism.  In addition, Gregory mentions that baptism was the first option the catechumens used during natural disasters and invasions.  Therefore, we conclude that baptism was not a popular option for the newly catechumens. Gregory of Nyssa implies that many people remained in the catechetical phase for quite a long. “How long will you be a student learning the alphabet”, he wonders. 
He emphatically mentions in his oration the possibility of young people dying from a disease, an accident or choking, or a heart attack. Through this way, he persuades the catechumens to seek the baptism in order to protect their bodies and soul and let the Lord prevail over them. For an older catechumen, it is easier to be baptized as they are approaching the end of their life.
It wasn't just Gregory of Nyssa who tried to get catechumens baptized. During the fourth and fifth centuries, we see other church fathers, like John Chrysostom, trying to convince the catechumens (and not just them) to insert baptism into their lives. Similarly to Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom dedicated whole orations on holy baptism in order to get baptism to prevail over the catechumens’ lives. 
Gregory of Nyssa’s oration has multiple levels: the catechetical level, baptismal practices, baptismal roles, emotional history, the aging process, and death cases. Gregory knitted the baptismal scarf step by step, in order to persuade the catechumens to get baptized immediately. Through different emotions and examples, he managed to preach a persuasive speech to the catechumens step by step. 
Baptism was a simple practice, which could be performed at any time in the fourth century. Of course, since 200 C.E. it used to be performed during the paschal celebration.  That is why Gregory was trying to get the catechumens baptized as soon as possible. Baptism involved water, prayer, and the baptist. There were primarily young people among the catechumens, and they stayed catechumens for an extended period of time. The church wasn't satisfied with that, so catechesis limits should be imposed, in order to move on to the baptismal practice sooner and get baptized.",372,395,1495,1337,Zoe Tsiami,2023-02-07 14:01:13.496 +0100,2023-05-31 18:08:47.823 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1648,Hosios Loukas,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The monastery of Hosios Loukas is located on the slopes of Helicon, near the village of Steiris. The monastery is named after its eponymous saint, St. Luke of Steiris, a local holy man active in Boeotia in the early tenth century. Luke's activities are recorded in an anonymously authored vita that details the life of the saint up until his death in 953. 

The art and architecture of the monastery firmly places it as one of the crowning achievements of Middle Byzantine design. Widely known for its twin katholika, the monastery's construction is seen as a foundational moment in Byzantine architectural design in Greece. The older of the twin katholika is dedicated to the Theotokos and is the first example of a four-column cross-in-square church on mainland Greece; meanwhile, the current katholikon dedicated to Hosios Loukas is the progenitor of the domed-octagon type of church construction that forms the basis for the so-called 'Helladic' school of architecture. Inside, the Hosios Loukas church is adorned with an exquisite program of gold mosaics that depict the life of Jesus Christ, while the crypt of the monastery is also outfitted with an extensive cycle of paintings. The site continues to be a functioning monastery and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.",953,1204,1860,1317,Justin Mann,2023-02-07 22:11:39.196 +0100,2023-02-08 20:59:27.889 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1649,St Bartholomew's Priory,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"St Bartholomew’s Priory and Hospital were founded in 1123 by Rahere, sometime courtier (and possibly court jester) of King Henry I. When Henry’s only son and heir William Ætheling was killed along with 300 others in the sinking of the White Ship, Rahere appears to have reconsidered his life. He went on pilgrimage to Rome, where he fell ill and was likely taken to the Hospital of St Bartholomew on Tiber Island. In the extremity of his illness, Rahere vowed that if he were to regain his health, he would build a hospital to treat the poor of London.

While convalescing, Rahere had a vision in which he was held by a monster over a fathomless black pit. St Bartholomew came to Rahere’s rescue, instructing him to build a priory as well as a hospital on the ‘smooth field’ outside London’s city walls – at that time home both to the king’s market and the town gallows. Returning to London, Rahere convinced the bishop of London and King Henry to allow him to build a priory and hospital in Smithfield, as the Apostle instructed. The foundation stone was laid on 25 March 1123.

The priory grew from 13 canons to over 35 by the end of the Middle Ages, and was at the centre of medieval London life. Its canons preached and taught across London, working to relieve the wants of the poor. The yearly Bartholomew Fair, held in the priory fairground, provided not only an outlet for sales of woollen cloth, but also three days of high revelry and of scholarly disputations in the churchyard.

St Bartholomew's Priory was one of the largest and wealthiest monastic foundations in medieval London, occupying a 9-acre site just north of the London city walls. To the splendid Romanesque core (ca. 1123-1140) of the quire was later added a Gothic clerestory (ca. 1220). The nave, (ca. 1180-1220) was Perpendicular Gothic - remains of the first bay can still be seen inside the church. The final bay of the nave with the former south west aisle door was converted into a gatehouse after the Dissolution, and a Tudor gatehouse (ca. 1560s) built on top of it. Around the year 1400, a programme of works was undertaken that resulted in the founder's splendid tomb - still to be seen in the church - and a chantry chapel for Roger Walden (bishop of London and former archbishop of Canterbury) which was torn down probably by the 1560s.

The Dissolution of the Monasteries came to St Bartholomew’s in 1539. The former Priory was sold to Sir Richard Rich; its nave was torn down and many of the former monastic buildings converted into private houses for influential courtiers. Under Mary I, Dominican friars briefly occupied the site; at her death, the priory church again became the Church of England parish church, as it remains today.",1123,2023,1861,1340,Charlotte Gauthier,2023-02-08 22:09:41.545 +0100,2023-04-11 22:05:18.144 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1653,Visigothic Homoian Christianity,43,Religious Group (v6),"Homoian (also homoean) Christians, from the ancient Greek homoios (ὅμοιος), meaning similar, believed that God the Father, and Christ the Son were similar in nature. This was distinct from Nicene Christianity which adhered to the view that the Father and Son were identical (homos-ὁμός) in nature. The theological position of Homoianism was presented at the Councils of Ariminium and Seleucia in 359 and ratified at the Council of Constantinople in 360 CE. Homoianism was favored by the emperors Constantius II and Valens. Homoian Christianity was championed by Acacius of Caesarea (died in 365 CE) and its followers were sometimes called 'Acacians'.

Arianism is often used (erroneously) in scholarship as a synonym for Homoian Christianity (as well as other theological positions rejecting the notion that the Son and Father are of the same nature). This stems from attempts by fifth-century CE opponents to slander Homoianism through association with the Alexandrian priest Arius (c.250 or 256-336 CE), who also believed that the nature of the Son was distinct from that of the Father.

Like other instances of religious conversion in Antiquity, the adoption of Homoian Christianity amongst Goths was a gradual process rather than a punctual event. The genesis of Homoian gothic communities occurred in 341 when Ulfilas (also Wulfila, c.311-383 CE), considered the apostle of the Goths, was appointed bishop of the Homoian (or a theological position best described as Homoian) communities in Gothic-controlled lands at the Council of Antioch. This would imply that there were indeed Christians already living in this area who had requested for a bishop. These may have been the descendants of Christian, Roman prisoners. He preached to and converted Gothic communities north of the Danube until he was expelled, along with many of his followers in 347/8 due to a Christian persecution in Gothia. Ulfilas and his followers settled in Moesia, in the Roman Empire. He developed a Gothic script and translated the Bible into Gothic. Homoian Christianity received imperial patronage from the emperors Constantius II from 350-61, during his time as sole ruler of the Empire, and from Valens until his death in 378. During this time, Ulfila' Gothic followers would adopt Homoianism, understood as a compromise between so-called 'Arianism' and Nicene Christianity due to its stipulation that the nature of Christ was similar to that of the Father.

During the reign of these two emperors, two other events can be pinpointed as part of the conversion process of Goths.
In 369, a power struggle occurred within the Thervingian people between Athanaric and Fritigern. Fritigern petitioned for support from the Roman emperor Valens. The Thervingian Goths under Fritigern's command converted to Homoian Christianity and requested theological teachers.
In 376, the westward movement of the Huns and Alans encroached on Gothic land and two gothic Groups, the Thervingi and Greuthungi, requested to cross the Danube into Roman land to seek refuge. The Thervingi were allowed to cross but the Greuthungi were denied entry. Nevertheless, the Greuthungi crossed into Roman land illegally. Conversion to Homoianism was a condition for admission and would have applied to all Goths entering the Empire at this time. 

The Council of Constantinople of 381, which was summoned by emperor Theodosius I and followed the Edict of Thessalonica, condemned Arianism (and its associate theological doctrine, Homoianism). Nevertheless, the council decreed that barbarian peoples could continue to practice Homoianism in the ways that their ancestors had. Scholars such as Herwig Wolfram argue that the conversion of Goths to Homoianism would have created a sense of unity, a distinct change from the heterogenous pagan beliefs from the pre-Christian era.

The exact ethnogenesis of the Visigoths, as a sub-group of Goths and other barbarian peoples has been disputed, but it seems likely that the identity of this group solidified under the Alaric in the 390s, until their definitive settlement in Aquitaine in 419 by the Roman Empire. Homoian Christianity became deeply entrenched within the ranks of the Visigothic aristocracy. Many Homoian bishops originated from aristocratic families.
In 579, Hermenegild, the son of king Liuvigild, converted to Nicene Christianity and led a revolt in Baetica. Liuvigild called a synod in Toledo in 580 which revised Homoian beliefs to be more acceptable to Nicene Christians. These reforms would have little impact given that Homoianism had already largely lost its appeal since the 560s, if not earlier. In the second half of the sixth century, Nicene and Homoian clergy, bishops and churches would be operating in parallel in most major cities in the Visigothic Kingdom.
Homoian Christianity would be replaced by Nicene Christianity as the state-sponsored religion at the third council of Toledo, in 589, convoked by king Reccared, who had himself converted to Nicene Christianity in 587. Former Homoian bishops were allowed to keep their posts and shared their duties with their Nicene counterparts, but metropolitans lost their province-wide authority.",341,589,1869,1339,Cédrik Michel,2023-02-11 18:59:53.441 +0100,2023-10-01 18:55:31.332 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1654,Le Parti du Mouvement de La Nahda حزب حركة النهضة,43,Religious Group (v6),"Une fraction des mouvements de l'Islam politique dans le monde arabe.
À la fin des années soixante du XXe siècle, la Jama'a al-Islamiyya الجماعة الإسلاميّة (Le groupe islamique) en Tunisie a commencé à se former. 
Au cours de l'année 1972, un groupe d'étudiants a annoncé sa propre identité politique et idéologique (religieuse), différente des identités politiques et idéologiques de gauche qui dominaient l'université à l'époque. Leur signature sur les déclarations qu'ils ont émises et accrochées aux murs de l'université ou du collège était ""Étudiants qui font la prière"".
Le 6 juin 1981, un groupe de personnalités politiques et scientifiques appartenant à la classe moyenne organisent une conférence de presse au cours de laquelle ils annoncent la formation d'un nouveau parti en Tunisie, l'appelant la «Mouvement de Tendance Islamique» (M.T.I.). Rashid Ghannouchi راشد الغنّوشي, Abdel Fattah Moro عبد الفتّاح مورو, Saleh Karkar صالح كركر et Ali Al-Areedh علي العريض étaient les plus éminents de ces personnages.
Ce qui a poussé ces personnalités à annoncer un parti à tendance islamique, c'est la vague d'ouverture apparue à l'horizon lorsque la figure destourienne (qui appartient au parti du pouvoir) à orientation arabo-islamique et africaine a pris les rênes du premier ministère de l'Etat tunisien.
Cependant, ce parti a rapidement connu un affrontement avec l'État, qui a refusé de lui accorder un visa de travail légal et emprisonné ses dirigeants, ce qui a entraîné de nouvelles figures de leadership, dont la plus célèbre est l'ingénieur Hammadi al-Jabali.
Pendant l'été de 1987, une forte confrontation a eu lieu entre la tendance islamique et le régime de Bourguiba. Cette confrontation s'est terminée par l'arrestation de la plupart des dirigeants historiques et de quelques dirigeants de la classe moyenne de l'organisation. La peine de mort attendait certains dirigeants, en particulier Rashid Al-Ghannouchi et le mathématicien Moncef Ben Salem.
Cependant, le coup d'État doux mené par le général Zine El Abidine Ben Ali a empêché ces peines de mort, et il semblait que la crise avec l'État se dirige vers une solution finale. Le mouvement a de nouveau cherché à obtenir un visa de travail légal et a changé son nom de «Tendance islamique» en «Mouvement Nahda». 
Cependant, l'affrontement violent entre le mouvement islamique et le régime n'a pas tardé, surtout après l'incendie du siège de l'Assemblée constitutionnelle démocratique au pouvoir à Bab Souika (l'ancien centre-ville de Tunis), qui a été menée par le mouvement Nahda, et à la suite de quoi l'un des gardiens de la place est mort.
Après cela, le mouvement Nahda a traversé des années que ses adhérents les nomment les années du Jénocide. Jusqu'à ce que la révolution du 17 décembre 2010 au 14 janvier 2011 ait lieu. Les immigrés islamistes sont revenus en Tunisie et ils ont reformé avec le reste des islamistes leur parti. Ensuite, ils ont demandé un visa pour un parti légal, qu'ils ont obtenu, et ils ont changé le nom de leur parti pour devenir le «Parti du mouvement Nahda».",1981,2023,1866,1225,Ali Makhlabi,2023-02-11 22:06:56.237 +0100,2023-03-22 09:58:52.332 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1656,Temple of the Rock/Temple HH1 (Tell Mardikh/ancient Ebla),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Temple of the Rock (Temple HH1) is a monumental temple building erected in the ancient city of Ebla (present-day Tell Mardikh). It dates back to the age of the Royal Archives of the great Early Syrian town, c. 2400–2300 BCE (in the traditional conventional chronology), that is the Early Bronze IVA of north-western inland Syria chronology. It is so far the only identified cult building belonging to the age of the Archives, along with the Red Temple on the Acropolis: together with the Archive’ texts, these two sanctuaries offer crucial insights into the religious phenomena in Ebla and Syria in the mature Early Syrian Period; and provide evidence of the unity and specificity of the religious architectural tradition of inland Syria in the central part of the third millennium BCE, when the in-antis temple model spreads.
The temple is located in the south-eastern Lower Town, west of the mighty Middle Bronze Age ramparts and not far from the south-east city-gate (the Steppe Gate). It occupied a peripheral position in the mature Early Syrian urban layout. In this sector (Area HH), a huge sacred area developed from the mid-third millennium BCE and remained continuously in use up to the final destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city around 1600 BCE. Five superimposed temples were excavated. The Temple of the Rock was the first building to be erected. We can identify this cult building with the Temple of Kura which stood close to the town wall and the Gate of Kura: the place where, according to the text of the “Ritual of Kingship”, the elaborate ritual of the renewal of kingship began with the queen entering the city after waiting for sunrise in the fields outside the town wall. A series of ceremonial acts and pilgrimages performed together by the king and queen followed, until the royal couple entered the second Temple of Kura within the SA.ZA on the Acropolis (now identified with the Red Temple) and concluded the ritual.
The temple is an imposing building (28 m long and some 21.50 m wide), facing east, still more than 3.50 m high, which featured a façade with projecting antae, a latitudinal cella, and a deep vestibule of the same size as the cella. The temple belongs to the in antis typology, well attested in the Syro-Levantine religious architecture from the mid-third millennium BCE, and exhibits strong similarities with the Red Temple on the Acropolis for its typology, size, and proportions. However, in the Temple of the Rock the cella (L.9190), to the west, and the vestibule (L.9495), to the east, had the same size (a peculiar feature not found elsewhere): both are moderately broad rooms, wider (10 m) than long (8.30 m). Based on the considerable thickness of the outer walls (about 6 m), the temple may have risen to over 15 m. It had stone foundations, mostly great basalt and limestone blocks of an average height of 0.80/1.20 m, and a mudbrick superstructure; the bricks belong to the rectangular type used in the mature Early Syrian Period, that is, 0.60 by 0.40 by 0.10 m.
The building was founded directly over a low emergence of the bedrock (hence its name), which was not completely levelled at this point: the irregularities and cavities in the rock were left visible in the floor of the cella and the vestibule, as they allegedly had a special meaning for the builders. In particular, the cella was built in a spot marked by a large ellipsoid cavity with three wells (P.9713, P.9717, P.9719), descending into the depths of the rock to the water-bearing stratum. These wells had probably been springs with special mythical, natural, or historical significance, presumably as the place from which the subterranean waters over which Kura presided sprang to the surface, or as the place from which the mythical divine residence of the lord of the pantheon could be reached. Therefore, the cavity and the wells would have been the reason which supported the choice of this peripheral site for the erection of the temple, both for the physical nature of the place (presence of fresh water) and for its mythical association with the residence of a great god in the abyss below.
The temple was destroyed at the end of the Early Bronze IVA, around 2300 BCE, when the whole city of the Royal Palace of the Archives was sacked and destroyed. It then underwent a sort of termination ritual, including the clearing of nearly all traces of destruction, the deposition of a great amount of fine vessels (more than 200) in two of the wells (P.9717 and P.9719) inside the cavity in the cella, and the ritual sealing of the cella and antecella by means of several mudbrick courses, at the beginning of the Early Bronze IVB. The inner space of the temple was, finally, filled up with a 3.5 m high filling of crushed limestone and chalky pebble, carried out to make the place inviolable after its abandonment. The location of the remains of the temple (which formed a small hillock), however, maintained its sacrality for the inhabitants of the later cities. In fact, during an advanced phase of the Early Bronze IVB (late Early Syrian Period) two adjacent temples were built to the east, in the open space in front of the oldest temple: Temple HH4 and Temple HH5; while two large, superimposed tripartite temples (HH3 and HH2) would have been erected in the same spot during the Middle Bronze Age (Old Syrian Period) (Matthiae 2021, pp. 65–83, 297–300).",-2400,-2300,1868,1184,Maura Sala,2023-02-13 10:03:48.219 +0100,2023-08-11 09:44:19.106 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The Conferences are the second volume of Cassian's instructions (the first volume is The Institutes) on how to correctly practice monasticism based on his experience living as a monk in Egypt. Unlike The Institutes, however, The Conferences is written as a series of conversations between a young Cassian, his monastic compatriot Germanus, and several venerable Egyptian monks. Conversations discuss the goals of monastic life, - principally ""purity of heart"" -  and the correct practice of asceticism, - neither too lax nor too severe. There are also detailed discussions on theology, including the notion of God as unencumbered by a physical body, the possibility of humans uniting with God in spiritual perfection, and  the influence of evil spirits on the mind and/or heart. This book gives a comprehensive vision of Cassian's ideal Egyptian monasticism in order to establish a similar institution in the West.",420,430,1872,1128,Joshua Schachterle,2023-02-14 23:21:50.351 +0100,2023-03-16 19:49:52.294 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1661,Ludlul Bel Nemeqi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, “I will praise the lord of wisdom,” is the incipit title of a Babylonian narrative poem that recounts the divinely-imposed suffering of the poem’s protagonist, one Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan, and his divinely-effected restoration. The poem is sometimes referred to as the “Babylonian Job,” though its contents differ significantly from the biblical book. About seventy cuneiform tablets and fragments attest the poem (a number that grows every few months due to new discoveries), from which scholars have reconstructed about three-quarters of its original text. The poem likely extended to some six hundred lines in antiquity, which ancient copyists divided into five sections called “Tablets.” Modern scholars number these with Roman numerals (I–V); Arabic numerals indicate line numbers within each Tablet.

The poem opens in the first-person voice of the protagonist, who praises the wrath and mercy of the Babylonian high god Marduk (I 1–40), the deity responsible for the man’s suffering and eventual recovery. In the lines immediately following the hymn the protagonist describes in a retrospective manner Marduk’s past anger toward him, which resulted in his loss of divine protectors and his reception of unfavorable signs and terrifying dreams. Expelled from his house, the protagonist recounts how he evoked the ire of his king and the jealousy of his colleagues, who schemed against him. Alienated from his community, family, and friends, the protagonist found himself completely alone; no one came to his aide. At the end of Tablet I without possessions, property, or professional position; grief-stricken, afraid, and helpless, Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan resolutely hoped for the arrival of relief. But, at the start of Tablet II, the second year of his trials, he was utterly disappointed. 

Surrounded by evil and without help from his personal deities and ritual experts, the protagonist tells how confused he was about his mistreat despite his sincere piety and ritual observances. This cognitive dissonance induced doubt in him about the knowability of the gods and elicited musings on the frailty and vacillations of human life. Giving up on such lofty and troubling thoughts, the protagonist describes a litany of demonically-delivered infirmities that plagued him, the language of which resonates strongly with lamentations and lists of symptoms in medical texts. As his condition worsened, he was confined to his bed; he gained no help from ritual specialists; and he received no mercy from his gods. At the end of Tablet II, with burial preparations and mourning complete, he tells how he awaited death.

In the first half of Tablet III, the protagonist describes (three or) four dreams (interpretations vary), in which several divine beings appeared to him, speaking a message of deliverance and healing. Marduk’s wrath was finally appeased; the high god had heard the man’s pleas for salvation. In a broken passage, it seems that the protagonist admits to his sins and acts of negligence. In the remainder of Tablet III, the ending of which is unrecovered, the protagonist describes the reversal of his infirmities, which continues into the very fragmentary and incompletely reconstructed Tablet IV. 

At the opening of Tablet V, Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan, now fully restored to health, praises Marduk, who is explicitly and emphatically referred to as the protagonist’s lord. Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan describes how after his restoration he entered the Esagil temple complex, the temple of Marduk in Babylon, to perform rituals of thanksgiving. As he entered twelve different temple gates, he received items related to his restoration (e.g., abundance, life, clear signs, release from guilt, relief of lamentation, etc.). After recounting these ritual activities at the temple, the poem leaves the protagonist’s first-person voice behind as it offers a crescendo of praise that moves from the citizens of Babylon to all of humanity. Although the conclusion to the poem, now cast in the voice of an omniscient third-person narrator, is not entirely recovered, its doxological intent is without doubt: “your (Marduk’s) praise is sweet!” (V 120).

Ludlul bēl nēmeqi was a literary classic in ancient Mesopotamia. The dozens of inscribed tablets bearing the poem’s text all come from major libraries and archives in first millennium BCE cities, including Nineveh, Ashur, Kalḫu, Sippar, Babylon, and Kish. At least fifteen of these textual witnesses are school exercise tablets, providing evidence of the poem’s use in scribal training and enculturation. The poem was also the subject of an ancient commentary, which indicates an active interest in the poem in the middle of the first millennium. Moreover, a few of the poem’s lines are used as explanatory citations in commentaries on other texts, including one from Hellenistic Uruk (late 4th century BCE), which attests to the poem’s on-going cultural cachet. 

Many scholars believe the poem was composed in the last quarter of the second millennium, but there is currently no solid proof for this reasonable hypothesis. It was certainly composed sometime between the reign of Babylonian Kassite king Nazimaruttash (r. 1301–1277 BCE), who the poem mentions by name (in V 100 or V 101 [reconstructions vary]), and the copying of the earliest Neo-Assyrian textual witnesses (c. 9–8th century BCE). 

The author of the poem is unknown. Since, however, the poem betrays a knowledge of medical vocabulary, the incantatory and lament traditions, anti-witchcraft texts, demonology, temple ritual and geography, as well as learned scribal hermeneutics, its author was very likely a scribal scholar from the ranks of the professional exorcists.",-1300,-300,1631,1352,Alan Lenzi,2023-02-16 05:54:42.441 +0100,2023-03-08 06:58:45.071 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1662,The miracles of Eric IV Ploughpenny,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Although never formally canonized, Eric IV Ploughpenny, king of Denmark, was regarded as a saint by some. When the ageing King Valdemar II of Denmark died in 1241, he was succeeded by his son Erik IV Ploughpenny. Due to conflicting power ambitions, however, relations were strained between Erik and his two brothers Abel and Christoffer. The following years were therefore marked by civil wars between Erik and Abel, especially. The conflict culminated in 1250, when Erik was murdered by the henchmen of his brother Abel acting, apparently, on his brother´s orders. Abel managed to escape any earthly punishment and thus became Erik´s successor on the throne. Many therefore saw it as god´s own punishment when Abel himself was killed on the battlefield merely two years later in 1252. The third brother Christoffer then took the throne. By this point, a local saint´s cult centered around Erik´s changing burial sites in the Danish town of Slesvig seems most likely to have begun already. The cult probably didn´t really gather strength, though, until king Christoffer with much pomp had him reburied in Ringsted monastery in 1258. King Christoffer had probably tried to gain formal recognition of the cult from the pope in Rome already while Erik was still buried in Slesvig, although this was in vain. Being interested in using the cult to strengthen his own position, the reburial in Ringsted most likely was part of Christoffer´s attempt to promote and strengthen the cult even more. Christoffer himself never benefitted much from this, though, dying very suddenly in 1259 amidst circumstances highly controversial. His plans for the reburial had more success, though, and over the decades that followed upon the reburial of Eric´s body at Ringsted monastery in 1258, the Benedictine monks at the abbey wrote down a text that collected the many miracles that king Eric performed there. Their list of miracles were added to continously and between the years 1258 and 1274 they recorded no less than 46 miracles happening. The pace of the cult seems to have slowed down after that, but a few more miracles were still added. The last of the 50 miracles mentioned were recorded in 1309. The text is structured chronologically starting out by introducing the Ringsted reburial and then mentioning the miracles one by one in the order that they occurred. The cult seems to have gathered much pace in the first few decades after the murder and after the reburial, especially, although by around 1309 the cult seems to have been at the end of it´s tether. No formal papal canonization of Erik´s cult was ever achieved and high-level political interest in the cult possibly also declined at some point. When its initial strength apparently didn´t hold in the long run, from c. the 14th c. onwards his cult generally seems to have been overshadowed by the saint´s cult of the Danish duke Canute Lavard (d. 1131) who was also buried in the monastery church, but whose cult had already achieved that same much-desired papal recognition. The miracles recorded tell stories about people being cured, people woken from the dead etc. A notable feature of the text is that much weight are put on having the miracles documented properly by often describing their formal circumstances such as e.g. the time or the year that it occurred, where it happened, to whom it happened and who this person was, how long time this person was sick, in which way this person was sick, mentioning the names of people who witnessed the miracle happening etc.",1258,1309,1873,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-02-16 12:11:32.152 +0100,2023-03-03 14:53:56.066 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The Didache is an early church document, but is distinctly Jewish in some ways, as well, and seems to show how a Jewish Christian community adapted its practices and procedures for gentile Christians (the nations). It has been dated as early as the late 1st century CE (Milavec) and as late as the early 2nd century CE (Niederwimmer). It includes three major sections: the first on ethics, the second on rituals, and the third on group or church organization. The community within which this document was (anonymously) produced was likely located in Antioch, Syria and it shares material with the Gospel of Matthew which was probably also produced there. There is some disagreement among scholars about which whether the Didache depends on Matthew or Matthew on the Didache, or whether they both depend on another source. Some facets of this document, the description of the Eucharist, for example, differ markedly from that of Paul's letters and the canonical gospels. T he Didache seems to indicate  that Jesus's death and resurrection were not the focal point of orthodoxy for this community, but rather ethical  and ritual practices.",50,110,1874,1128,Joshua Schachterle,2023-02-16 18:11:40.175 +0100,2023-02-17 22:49:07.448 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The purpose of the document was to formally announce to all members of a congregation the heresies of concern to the Inquisition at the time of reading and posting. The priest or Bishop would read the edict during mass, posting it on the door of the church or Cathedral afterwards. Parishioners were then to confess their own heretical acts that they had been informed of, at which point they would be given grace if they confessed within a specified period of time. Parishioners were also expected to confess the heretical acts of their neighbors or family members if they had witnessed them. Among the most common major heresies were the continued practices of Judaism and Islam, or the teachings of Luther and Calvin. Lesser heresies included the possession of forbidden books, sexual and marital crimes like bigamy or solicitation in the confessional, or following superstitions like witchcraft.",1478,1834,1876,1349,Amanda Summers,2023-02-17 15:59:51.283 +0100,2023-02-20 19:18:58.559 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1668,Daphni (Μονή Δαφνίου),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The monastery of Daphni is located to the west of Athens, Greece, and maintains a prominent position along the Iera Odos (Sacred Way). The monastery is dedicated to the Dormition of the Virgin and represents one of the architectural jewels of Middle Byzantine Greek architecture. 

The katholikon of the monastery is in the domed-octagon style that typifies the so-called ""Helladic"" school of architecture, such as is seen at its architectural predecessor, Hosios Loukas. The interior of the structure is decorated by an impressive cycle of gold mosaics that is highlighted by an imposing depiction of Christ Pantokrator in the central dome. Yet, even in light of clearly great effort and expenditure that went into the monastery's construction and decoration, little is known of its origins or founder. The monastery is noted only in two brief abstracts that reveal relatively little about Daphi's history. Based on art and architectural comparison, however, it seems the monastery was constructed sometime around 1080 CE and remained in function until the arrival of the Crusaders in the early thirteenth century, when it was taken over by Cistercian monks.

In later years, the monastery took under various functions. It was used as a military headquarters during the Greek Revolution, as a barracks by Bavarian troops in the 1830s, and public mental hospital in the 1880s. The monastery is currently an archaeological site under the jurisdiction of the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports (Western Attica Ephoreia) and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",1080,1458,1878,1317,Justin Mann,2023-02-18 21:29:46.246 +0100,2023-05-01 17:54:25.329 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1669,The Inner Training (Neiye 內業),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Likely an independent text of self-cultivation produced during the Warring States period (472 – 221 BCE), the “Inner Training” (neiye 內業) is preserved today as chapter 49 of the Guanzi 管子 (“[The Book of] Master Guan”) compilation, a heterogenous work of statecraft named after Guan Zhong 管仲 (conventional dates, 720-645 BCE), a famous prime minister of the state of Qi 齊. Much of the “Neiye”’s significance lies in the fact that it is one of the earliest extended discussions of the concept of qi 氣, a term that encompasses the English meanings of both “matter” and “energy.”// The “Neiye” argues for a monistic cosmos in which all things are composed of qi. This cosmos is structured hierarchically because qi can exist in different grades of refinement, with more refined qi considered to be more powerful and valuable than less refined qi. For instance, Heaven (tian 天) is both literally and hierarchically higher than Earth (di 地), because it is composed of more rarefied qi. The cosmos as a whole operates according to an underlying “pattern” (li 理) that is sometimes referred to as the “Way” (dao 道).// Highly refined qi is sometimes referred to in the text as shen 神, a term that was used in the Warring States period to refer to both deceased humans and to non-human but powerful entities that governed parts of the cosmos. For this reason, shen is often translated as “spirit” or “divine.” The “Neiye” references these contemporary meanings by stating that when shen flows in between Heaven and Earth, it is referred to as “ghosts and spirits” (guishen 鬼神), who other parts of the text describe as having the ability to control and transform other things.// Within this monistic schema, humans are defined as composite entities that contain both the less refined qi of Earth and the more refined qi of Heaven. Humans are subject to other powers in the cosmos because their actions are frequently not aligned with the Way and because their emotional fluctuations in response to changes in the world gradually dissipate and deplete their qi.// Accordingly, the “Neiye” teaches potential practitioners how to use a variety of techniques to regulate themselves and bring themselves into alignment with the rest of the cosmos so that they can preserve and refine their qi. Cultivating their qi in this way endows practitioners with many benefits including longevity and health, the ability to know inauspiciousness and auspiciousness without resorting to contemporary practices of divination, and even the ability to control and transform other things. Consequently, those at the highest levels of self-cultivation are said to be “like spirits” (rushen 如神).// In making this argument, the “Neiye” was opposing the ritual practices that were dominant in the courts of the Warring States rulers. These rituals focused on maintaining a strict separation between humans and spirits and used sacrifices to cajole or even coerce the latter to use their powers on behalf of the former, often in divinatory contexts. Therefore, the “Neiye” is best understood as an attempt to establish independent authority outside of the courts’ ritual hegemony based on a monistic claim for self-divinization.// ***Note: references to the “Neiye” text in the comments below employ the verse numbers of Harold Roth’s translation in Original Tao.",-400,9,1546,708,Matthew Hamm,2023-02-18 22:26:08.810 +0100,2023-06-27 19:37:09.534 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1674,New Hampshire Declaration of Faith,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The New Hampshire Declaration of Faith was the statement of faith adopted by the  Baptist State Convention of New Hampshire on January 15, 1833. It was composed by a committee including I. Pearson, B. Stow, and J. Newton Brown. (Hurlin, et. al, 1902,56) The first edition included sixteen articles summarizing key components of Christian Doctrine. An expanded edition published in J. Newton Brown's Church Manual included two additional articles. Brown's Church Manual also included a church covenant. The first edition and Brown's edition included references to the Bible to explain or defend the articles. Sometimes, the Scripture references were omitted or abridged.

A significant number of Baptist churches adopted the New Hampshire Declaration as a summary statement of Baptist beliefs. Many different kinds of Baptists adopted this document as well, or modified it to fit local or institutional needs.  Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary's adoption of the New Hampshire Declaration with amendment is one example of the malleability of the Declaration.  It provided a base text for the first edition of the Southern Baptist ""Baptist Faith and Message"" and the Baptist Bible Union's ""Articles of Faith, 1923.""",1833,2023,1882,1367,Jonathan McCormick,2023-02-22 20:21:04.208 +0100,2023-04-20 23:08:08.827 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1675,On the Divine Liturgy,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Germanos' treatise ""On the Divine Liturgy"" has survived in numerous manuscripts and diverse versions, making it very difficult to determine the original form of the text. A significant number of manuscripts testifies primarily to the popularity of the treatise. At the same time, numerous reviews also point to the evolution of the liturgy - successive interpolations and changes in the arrangement of chapters say a lot about the transformations within the liturgy. They also prove that the treatise did not become ""antiquarian"" reading but remained ""alive"", explaining the meaning of individual liturgical rites and the objects used during them. Slightly simplifying the problem, it can be said that the text changed with the liturgy.
It was Maximus the Confessor who wrote the first Byzantine liturgical commentary - ""Μυσταγωγία"" - which initiated a new genre that would be developed until the end of the Byzantine Empire. Thus, Germanos' ""Ἱστορία ἐκκλησιαστικὴ καὶ μυστικὴ θεωρία"" by Germanos is another stage in the development of Byzantine liturgical commentaries. In this text, Germanos presented the liturgy from a double perspective: the heavenly liturgy and the earthly life of Christ as well. 
The text in the edition prepared by Nilo Borgia contains 43 chapters of varying lengths. The narrative actually begins in medias res because any introduction does not precede it. Similarly, there is no separate conclusion or summary. Apart from these shortcomings, the commentary has a reasonably logical structure, in which we can distinguish three essential parts:
1. the first one is devoted primarily to the space of the church, gestures, liturgical vessels and vestments, as well as people serving during the liturgy (1–22);
2. the second one is on the introductory rites and the liturgy of the Word, which consists of antiphons, psalms, the First (or Little) Entrance, readings from the Apostolic Letters and the Gospels, and the Cherubic Hymn (23-35);
3. the third is on the Eucharist, consisting of the Great Entrance, anaphora, communion and sending out; in this part, the sense of the Lord's Prayer is also laid out (36–43). The author generally explains subsequent issues that form separate chapters. Thus, it is not a continuous story but rather a collection of unconnected explanations, usually closed wholes. However, their well-thought-out order – essentially corresponding to the course of the liturgy – determines the final coherence of the work so that we can talk about a treatise and not just a loose collection of instructions.
The most likely author of the treatise is Patriarch Germanos I. Broadly speaking, Germanos lived from about the second half of the 7th century to the first half of the 8th century. Germanos' father was Justinian, a patrician serving at the court of Heraclius. In 668, on the orders of Constantine IV Pogonatus (668–685), he was executed for allegedly participating in a conspiracy against Constans II (641–668), who was murdered in Syracuse. In connection with this situation, young Germanos also suffered because he was castrated. After castration, Germanos was included in the Church of Holy Wisdom clergy in Constantinople. Then he served as the Metropolitan of Cyzicus from around 705 (?). After the death of Patriarch John VI of Constantinople (711–715), Germanos was elected in his place. He resigned from office in 730. This decision was due to the conflict with the emperor Leo III (717–741), who was supposed to persuade the patriarch to adopt an iconoclastic attitude. However, it was only in texts from the beginning of the 9th century (Theophanes the Confessor's ""Chronicle""; Stephen the Deacon's ""Life of St. Stephen the Younger"") that Germanos was portrayed as a heroic opponent of iconoclasm.
Germanos I is considered the author of many texts, among which we can distinguish letters, sermons, and theological and poetic works. Some of them - like ""Ἱστορία ἐκκλησιαστικὴ καὶ μυστικὴ θεωρία"" - raise doubts among researchers because it is often difficult to find unambiguous evidence confirming the authorship of the holy patriarch.",700,730,1883,1360,Magdalena Garnczarska,2023-02-24 22:10:33.544 +0100,2023-06-09 10:13:07.533 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1676,Saint Catherine's Monastery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Saint Catherine's Monastery (official name: Sacred Autonomous Royal Monastery of Saint Katherine of the Holy and God-Trodden Mount Sinai) is believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited Christian monastery in the world. Located in Egypt at the foot of Mount Sinai, it was commissioned by the Emperor Justinian I in 565 C.E. In fact, there are two inscriptions from the time of the monastery's founding that survive. One says "" For the salvation of our most august emperor Justinian.” The other says, “For the memory and repose of our departed empress Theodora.” 
The monastery is said to have been built around the original burning bush encountered by Moses. It also houses a large collection of early Christian icons and one of the oldest continuously functioning libraries in world.
The monastery complex, surrounded by thick, granite walls, consists of a main church surrounded by nine smaller chapels, with monks' quarters along parts of the surrounding walls. 
It has been occupied continuously by monks since the 6th century. In the Middle Ages, Crusaders briefly visited the monastery as a site of pilgrimage, and inscriptions in Frankish in the refectory built by the Crusaders still survive. After the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, the monastery fell under the protection of  Sultan Selim I.
Today, it is a fully functioning monastery within the Orthodox Church. Part of the monks' duty is to protect the monastery and surrounding holy sites for the sake of pilgrims.",565,2023,1550,1128,Joshua Schachterle,2023-02-27 20:41:07.255 +0100,2023-04-10 19:47:46.149 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1677,Royal Hittite Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Just as its contemporaries in the Late Bronze Age, Hittite state had a polytheist religion. The pantheon included hundreds of deities, which grew over time with the deities various cultures (e.g. Hattians, Palaeans, Luwians, Hurrians, etc.) that were incorporated through conquest or close contact, so much so that Hittites referred to their pantheon in general as the “Thousand Gods of Hatti,” the last word being a reference to their country. While the actual number of gods and goddesses may not reach a thousand, if all divine beings, like the demons (mythological creatures, animals, mixed beings) and topographical features (mountains, rivers, springs, etc.) included, the number certainly exceeds a thousand. The top deities of the pantheon were the Sun-deities, both male and female, and the Storm-gods. Syncretism only occurred in a limited fashion in the later periods of the empire. Thus, many local gods were distinguished from similar deities, resulting in numerous variations by location, e.g. Storm God of Hatti, Storm God of Zippalanda, Storm God of Nerik, etc. The divine world was conceived as a mirror of the human world, where anthropomorphic deities were organized in a hierarchy of various families and like humans had needs to eat, sleep, and even be entertained. Temples were the houses of the deities where they inhibited an image, typically an anthropomorphic statue, but in some occasions it could also be a zoomorphic statue, a worked or unworked stele, or even a manufactured symbol, such as a golden disk for a Sun deity. Of course, such man-made objects would only be inhibited by the deities through special rituals. While the most prominent gods, the Sun-deities and the Storm-gods were responsible for the essence of life with their sun-light and waters, other deities presided over various matters like warfare, birth, death, reproduction, love, and so forth. 
Since almost all of the written documentation of Hittites originates from the administrative archives of the Hittite state, what we know of their beliefs pertains almost entirely to the official cult of the state that was headed by the king and the royal family. The king as the high priest of all the deities had a special role between the gods and the humans. He had to ensure the deities of the land were served and taken care of by the people of Hatti, so that the deities would take care of the land and the people. To that effect the state maintained numerous temples all over the land for various deities. While not many Hittite cities have been explored, at their capital city Hattusa, modern day Boğazkale in central Turkey, ruins of over 30 temples have been unearthed. The administration ensured that temples all over Hatti were adequately staffed and maintained and the deities were properly served, which included daily ritual offerings. The temples were an extension of the state administration. They were provided by property and personnel, including slaves, to maintain their own economies, but were definitely not independent of the state. Annually, seasonally, or monthly, over a hundred religious festivals were conducted by the state cult throughout the year. The king was responsible in guiding all societal religious activities.  He and/or royal family members regularly travelled to various locations to attend the festival ceremonies. In festivals, deities are praised, provided with offerings, entertained with singers, dancers, and even sports activities, and in some instances the images of the deities were paraded in processions giving the public a rare opportunity to view them, who normally remained in the inner sancta of the temples accessible only to a select few. To oversee his duties properly, the king had to communicate with the gods, which was accomplished through various divinatory methods, such as extispicy, augury, lot oracles, dream incubation, or by interpreting unsolicited omens. Cultic specialists were experienced with numerous rituals that were performed for rite de passage like birth, puberty, marriage, death, or to treat illnesses and ailments. The funerals of the royal family involved cremation of the body. The dead kings and other royal family members were believed have “become gods,” and passed into the divine domain for a pleasant afterlife.",-1650,-1180,1884,1019,Tayfun Bilgin,2023-02-28 03:53:30.873 +0100,2023-05-09 06:34:50.329 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1678,Translation of the holy Margrethe,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The text is interesting as Margrethe is the only indigenous Danish woman who was both venerated as a saint and of whom written source material is also preserved. She was a noble woman personally related to the famous Danish archbishop Absalon. Details of her life are scarce, but her family relations to Absalon and thereby also to the powerful Hvide family clan seems to show that she probably originated from the island of Zealand. The text begins its story only at her death telling how, in the year 1176, she was murdered by her husband Herlog. Afterwards Herlog hung her body on a rafter to make it look like she had committed suicide by hanging thus making himself look innocent. The local priest believed the suicide to be true and therefore denied her a burial on the holy ground of the cemetary. Instead, apparently, she was buried on a field near the beach where a chapel was later erected. When lights in the sky at night over the burial site marked her innocence, it was reported to Absalon who at that time was still bishop in the local diocese of Roskilde. Even though he was skeptical, the rumours increased and he therefore had an investigation begun. He then confronted Herlog who admitted his guilt. Margrethe´s relatives wanted to take revenge on Herlog, but Absalon managed to calm them down. Fronting a great crowd he then travelled to the burial site where her body was dug up, washed and carried in procession back to the town of Roskilde. The text concludes by decribing how she was buried with great pomp in the Church of the Virgin Mary where many miracles later happened at her burial site. It has sometimes been mentioned that she buried in the famous Roskilde cathedral originally. However, it is known from later documents, though, that her saint´s cult was attached to the still preserved monastery church of the abbey of the Cistercian nuns in Roskilde. This monastery chuch probably served as her original burial site in Roskilde all along. An attempt to have her papally canonized probably did not become succesful, but this seems to have had little immediate effect on the popularity of her cult locally in the Roskilde diocese where her cult appears to have remained popular throughout the 13th C. and perhaps also during the later middle ages. The text was written sometime after c. 1191/1192, but most likely before march 1201.",1176,1201,1885,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-03-06 09:38:44.532 +0100,2023-03-06 09:42:31.642 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1680,Cult of Trophonius,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This entry relates to the cult of Trophonius in the small city-state Lebadea in western Boeotia. Trophonius was a local oracular deity who was thought to be the son of either the Orchomenian hero Erginus or Apollo. He is credited with the building of Delphi with his mythical brother Agamedes (Homeric Hymn to Apollo 3.296). 

According to Pausanias (9.37.5-7), Trophonius and his brother built a treasury chamber for King Hyrieus on Boeotia, which included a secret entrance. The two brothers used this entrance to steal treasure from Hyrieus, who eventually realised that treasure was being taken from him and set a trap. Agamedes was caught in the trap, and Trophonius chopped off his brother's head so that he could not be recognised. Following this, he fled to Lebadea, where the earth swallowed him. 

Later, the Boeotians suffered from a two year drought and sent envoys from every city in the region to consult the oracle at Delphi, who told them that an unnamed hero was angry for not receiving cult. An envoy from the city of Acraephia found the cave of Trophonius after following a swarm of bees, and they began giving him cult - consequently, the drought ended, and Trophonius took his place as a local deity (Pausanias 9.40.1).

Pausanias also recounts the process occurring when visiting the oracle, see 9.39.4.

His significance can be seen in the story of Mys consulting Trophonius in the sixth century (Herodotus 8.133.1) and the message sent from Trophonius to the Thebans before the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE (Diodorus 15.53.4).",-800,200,1887,1272,Thomas Alexander Husøy,2023-03-06 17:10:32.544 +0100,2023-12-05 11:21:28.014 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1682,"The Church of St. Paraskevi, Kitiros, Crete",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of St. Paraskevi is a single nave chapel covered with a pointed barrel vault and a saddle roof on the exterior. A small cemetery surrounds the western end of the church now enclosed by a modern fence. Located just east of the small village of Kitiros in the southwest corner of Crete, the church sits on a high outcrop overlooking the small river Pelekaniotikos which runs down to the coastal town of Palaiochora, roughly 15km away by foot. The dedicatory inscription of the church, partially preserved along the southwest wall above the image of the Archangel Michael, indicates that the church was built and painted with the contribution and efforts of the Christians of the district (τούρμα) of Kitiros, which includes the various small villages in the surrounding area including Chasi, Sklavopoula, and the metochi of Moustaki in the year 6881, Indiction 15 (1372-73). 

Inside the church, a transverse arch divides the interior into two bays with the sanctuary separated today by a wooden iconostasis. The wall paintings, although damaged in places, are in good condition. The conch of the sanctuary shows the Virgin Blachernitissa above four co-Officiating Bishops flanked on either side by St. Stephen and St. Romanus the Melodist. The lower register of both the north and south walls of the sanctuary are decorated with ten frontal saints including the monk St. John Kalybites, St. Simeon Stylites and St. Anthony. The barrel vault is decorated with the Ascension of Christ to the east and, to the west, four compartments showing the Anastasis, the Empty Sepulchre, the Incredulity of Thomas, and Christ Appearing to the Two Marys.

The raised transverse arch in the center of the church is decorated with the prophets David and Jeremiah to the north and Solomon and Isaiah to the south. The images of St. Peter and St. Paul face one another along the lower register of the archway. On the southern wall, a large Deesis, showing Christ flanked by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist, is followed by the images of St. Kyriaki and St. Marina. The northern wall similarly shows St. Paraksevi, presented frontally under an archway decorated with palm fronds, followed by the images of St. George on horseback and St. Mamas. Scenes from the life of St. Paraskevi, the titular saint, along with images from the Christological Cycle decorate the barrel vault.

To the right of the entrance, below a large image of the Crucifixion, are scenes of Hell and the damned including images of The Farmer who Ploughs and Reaps over the Boundary Line, the Thieving Tailor, The Miller Who Cheats at the Scales, and the Livestock Thief and Robber (shown with an ass on his back and a goat hanging from his neck). The larger agricultural concerns of the communities who sponsored this church can be seen in the choice of Individual Sinners. The inclusion of both St. Mamas and St. George, important saints for both shepherds and farmers alike, shows the need to protect livestock from illness and theft. Additionally, the two female sinners, one punished for not nursing her child and the other for sexual license, demonstrates both the anxiety concerning the wellbeing of children and the larger social and moral boundaries set within these communities.

Although the Church of St. Paraskevi is most famous for its image of the Individual Sinners, the extensive cycle of the Life of St. Paraskevi is also important for the iconographic diversions from what is seen in other preserved cycles of the saint.",1372,2023,1888,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-03-08 22:01:54.422 +0100,2023-05-23 19:16:33.642 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1683,Book of Leviticus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Leviticus is the third book in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible). It consists of 27 chapters and much of the content is Yahweh's instructions to Moses at Mount Sinai. Leviticus takes place within the larger story that narrates the Israelites' escape from Egypt and journey into the Promised Land. In Leviticus, Yahweh gives instructions to Moses, and Moses repeats the instructions to the Israelites.  This material includes: laws concerning sacrifice (for priests and non-priests), details concerning the priesthood, issues of ritual purity/impurity, and exhortations and instructions for living a holy life. The dating of Leviticus has proved to be challenging, as the book makes no reference to outside historical events. Consequently, there is no clear consensus regarding the date of its composition. However, the book does bear signs of literary growth and development indicating that its composition likely happened in several stages.",-800,-400,1889,1368,John Mellison,2023-03-09 00:11:03.225 +0100,2023-03-09 00:13:07.689 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It is characterized throughout by an attitude of traditionalist antiquarianism and hostility towards Christianity, and informed by previous experiments in the genre such as the comparable work of Philostratos.

1685,De Dea Syria,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"De Dea Syria is a text attributed to Lucian which describes the mythology and worship of the goddess Atargatis in the Syrian city of Hieropolis, as well as the temple dedicated to her and the legends surrounding it. It begins with a discussion of the rites of Astarte practiced in nearby Byblos, before turning its gaze to Hieropolis and the origins of its ancient temple through a retelling of the Atra-Hasis flood myth where the deluge is drained through a cleft in the rock beneath the sanctuary, and going on to state that others aver that it was founded by Semiramis in honor of her mother, the aquatic goddess Dirketo, or by a certain Attes in honor of Rhea, or, alternately, as a site of Bacchic worship. The construction of the current iteration of the sanctuary is attributed to a certain Kombabos who castrated himself as a way to cure himself of his attraction to his stepmother (an occurrence connected to the rites of self-castration practiced by the Galli). Finally, the temple itself is described as being an ionic building replete with statues, xoana, ritual implements, sanctified pools and flocks of sacred animals. The diverse rites practiced within the temple are also enumerated, including the animal sacrifices and ecstatic rites which characterize worship at the site, as well as the dedications made to it by the inhabitants of the regions (indeed the author states that he himself dedicated the first growth of his beard to the temple as was the custom among Syrian youths and maidens) It might also be argued to constitute an early work of cultural anthropology or comparative religion, owing to its focus on the origins of particular rites and rituals practiced at Hieropolis and the similarities (and, indeed, common origins) of these ceremonies with the practices of other antique cultures, often making comparison with wider Hellenistic religious culture.  It is written in a Herodotean Ionic style, and implicitly references Herodotean notions of historiography and narrative.The nature of the religious pageantry attached to the temple complex is also described in detail, imparting a sense of the nature of Syrian religious practice at the beginning of Late Antiquity.",150,250,1927,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-03-09 00:54:56.821 +0100,2023-06-08 19:37:09.435 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1688,Arianism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Arianism has been used as a term to designate theological beliefs attributed to Arius (c.250-336 CE), a Christian priest from Alexandria. Arius’ written works survive only in fragments, making it difficult to reconstruct his beliefs. This is only complicated by countless attempts made by Arius’ opponents to distort and ridicule his theological views.

 The most distinctive feature of Arianism is the relationship of the Son, Christ, to the Father, God. God, the Father, has absolute priority over all else, including the Son. According to Arius, the superiority of God, the Father, over Christ, the Son, was expressed by familial hierarchy according to which the Father was superior to the Son. Christ was begotten by God as a product of His will. Consequently, there was a time when Christ did not exist. As a creature of God, Christ cannot comprehend the nature of God, nor his own nature, but can lead others towards the worship of the one God.
Arius' theological beliefs brought him into conflict with Alexander of Alexandria (250-326 or 328 CE), who supported the Origen’s view of the eternal coexistence of the Father and the Son. Arius travelled to North Africa and the Near East and gained the support of other bishops, such as Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia, who also believed that Alexander’s stance jeopardized the unity of God and the primacy of the God-Father.
The emperor Constantine summoned the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE and its debate generated the belief that Christ was coeternal and of the 'same substance' (ὁμοούσιος-homoousios, composed of ὁμός-homós, 'same' and οὐσία-ousía, 'substance') as God. 
This council consequently deemed Arius’ beliefs as heretic and he, along with two bishops who refused to accept the outcome of the council, were sent into exile. Constantine’s decision to invite bishops throughout the Empire to condemn Arius' beliefs helped to cement a precedent according to which imperial intervention could summon councils to maintain the unity of the Christian church, and by extension, the Roman Empire.
However, the Council of Nicaea would not resolve the conflict over Arianism. Arius was recalled from exile by Emperor Constantine in 328, and invited to return to Alexandria, but prevented from reintegrating the community of the Egyptian Church by Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria (296 or 298-373 CE). Arius was reinstated in 335 and even accepted the tenets of Nicene creed when examined by Constantine at a council in Constantinople in early 336.
Arius died in 336 before he could return to Alexandria. When Arius died, Constantine considered his beliefs orthodox. Sources from the late fourth and fifth centuries generated gruesome accounts of Arius’ death. A bitter critic, Socrates Scholasticus, wrote that Arius shamefully died from an intestinal hemorrhage, a fitting punishment for his heretic views.
The narratives that ‘Arianism’ was characterized by a coherent set of beliefs and that ‘Arians’ were a defined groups with shared beliefs and continuity over times are a fantasy. The term 'Arian' was never used by its adherents but was rather employed to slander the beliefs of individuals deemed heretics, who may not even have practiced any beliefs held by Arius himself. The Homoian beliefs of emperors Constantius II, Valens, the Goths (and later Ostrogoths, Visigoths) as well as Anomoeans (also called Eunomians) were stigmatized as heretics by their opponents through the label of 'Arian'. 
Arianism (and its associate theological doctrine, Homoianism) was once again condemned in the Edict of Thessalonica (27 February 380) and at the Council of Constantinople of 381, summoned by emperor Theodosius I. Nevertheless, at the turn of the fifth century, scholars believe that Homoian Christians would have composed a majority in Constantinople.",325,671,2006,1339,Cédrik Michel,2023-03-13 18:06:33.369 +0100,2023-10-01 18:52:07.566 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1690,Christianity in Byzantium: between the end of Iconoclasm and the Schism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Council of Constantinople that the Byzantine regent Theodora summoned in 843 convened to refute iconoclasm and restore the worship and the veneration of the Holy Icons, marking the end of Iconoclasm, which caused several serious problems to the Byzantine empire in both religious and political level. However, albeit the period after iconoclasm was generally peaceful, it was not entirely tranquil, since the iconoclastic controversy left behind a legacy of factions. Patriarch Methodius I (843-847) accommodated former iconoclasts in the Church, provided that they renounce their heretic views. Methodius’s policy met strong opposition by the monks of the Studios monastery in Constantinople, many of which were excommunicated by Methodius before his death in 847. An intense struggle for succession has begun until Empress Theodora appointed St. Ignatius, the son of the Emperor Michael I Rangabe and opponent of Iconoclasm, to succeed Methodios. St. Ignatius was fervently accused by his enemies that, since he had not been elected in a synod and subsequently confirmed by the Emperor, but he was being appointed by the Empress Theodora, he was not a legitimate patriarch. Furthermore, St. Ignatius soon became involved in the conflict between the monks of the Stoudion monastery and the moderates in the Church. This dispute was about whether to depose clergymen who had cooperated with iconoclast policies in the past or not. Ignatius took the side of the conservative Stoudite monks and deposed the archbishop of Syracuse, Gregory Asbestas (844-880), the leader of the moderate party. Asbestas protested in 853 to Pope Leo IV (847-855) seeking a redress. Thus, a period of friction in relations between the Church of Rome and that of Constantinople had begun: Asbestas and several other bishops had been condemned in a synod called by St. Ignatius without papal consent. These events were the beginning for the so-called Photian schism. The schism was initially caused due to political reasons. Michael III (the so-called Drunkard) became emperor at a young age, while his mother Theodora served as regent. His uncle Bardas, Theodora’s brother, was an influential advisor. However, he found a fervent critic in the face of St. Ignatius: Bardas was accused of committing incest with his daughter-in-law, therefore St. Ignatius publicly denied him the Eucharist in the Hagia Sophia. Consequently, St. Ignatius lost support and he was forced to resign in 858. He was replaced by the layman Photius. Photius became a monk on December 20, 858 and on the following four days was successively ordained lector, sub-deacon, deacon and priest. He was made patriarch on Christmas day. St. Ignatius’s supporters however sought the aid of Pope Nicholas I (858–867). The Pope was angered by Byzantine missions among the Bulgars, whom he regarded as belonging to his juristiction. Nicholas wrote to the Bulgarians accusing the Greeks and Photius replied by accusing the Western Chruch of heretically altering the creed in saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son (Filioque). He declared Pope Nicholas deposed in 867. When the new emperor, Basil I the founder of the Macedonian dynasty, rose to the Byzantine throne, he reinstated St. Ignatius while Pope Nicholas’s successor (869) Adrian II, condemned Photius. But when St. Ignatius passed away, Photius quietly became patriarch again. Hence a schism occurred, which is called the Photian schism. The schism was mostly about whether the Church of Rome possessed monarchical power of jurisdiction over all churches, or whether it was the senior of the five Patriarchates and therefore could not canonically interfere with the internal affairs of another Patriarchate. The mutual distrust shown in the time of Photius erupted again in the middle of the 11th century, after papal enforcement of Latin customs upon Greeks in southern Italy. The patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius (1043 - 1059), closed Latin churches in Constantinople as a reprisal. Cerularius quarreled with Pope Leo IX over church practices in which the Roman Church differed from Constantinople, particularly the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist. Dissenting opinions were also exchanged over other theological and cultural issues, ranging from the issue of papal supremacy in the Church to the filioque clause and other disagreements between the patriarchates. Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida (or Humbert of Moyenmoutier) came from Italy to protest, was accorded an icy reception, and left a bull of excommunication (July 16, 1054) on the altar of the great church of Hagia Sophia. The bull anathematized (condemned) Michael Cerularius, the Greek doctrine of the Holy Spirit, the marriage of Greek priests, and the Greek use of leavened bread for the Eucharist. These events caused the East-West Schism and led to the end of the alliance between the Byzantine emperors and the Popes. Later Popes allied with the Normans against the Byzantine Empire.",843,1054,1893,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-03-15 09:29:26.118 +0100,2023-03-22 10:03:04.959 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1692,The holy Niels of Århus (younger text),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The holy Niels of Århus was a local Danish saint venerated in Århus diocese in Jutland during the middle ages. Two hagiographic texts are known about him: an older one and a younger one. Even though these two have been preserved together as part of a collective manuscript, it is necessary to distinguish between them as they are quite different not only in dating and in their individual background of creation, but also stylistically.

As the dating of the younger Niels legend has been revised for the purpose of this description, it is necessary to shortly explain why. The only dating of the younger legend known for sure so far is that it must have been written after 1306. Hans Olrik therefore suggested that it was written probably some time into the 14th C. and suggested that the deacon Trugot of Århus mentioned in the legend as a contemporary person could very well be the same man as the canon Trugot of Århus known in 1345 from an external source. Later on M.Cl. Gertz repeated this observation and  suggested furthermore that the writer of the younger text probably lived around c. 1350. Backing this up he identified also another man mentioned in the text as a contemporary person: cantor Johannes of Århus. Gertz identified that this cantor Johannes (the latin form of the Danish name Jens) was also mentioned in 1345 in an external source.
However, it seems possible to specify the dating of the younger text a little more and place it a bit earlier. Going over the preserved medieval documents, one cantor Jens Rød of Århus (i.e. Johannes) is mentioned for the first time on 12. November 1335. His presumed precedessor as cantor, Jakob, is mentioned for the last time on 15. Oktober 1325.  This cantor Jens of Århus is mentioned for the last time on 9. May 1345. His presumed successor in office, prior Peder, is mentioned for the first time as cantor in a document dated in 1354 before 14. april. Since the younger text about the holy Niels was written while Johannes (Jens) was cantor of Århus, it thus must have been written sometime after 15. Oktober 1325, but before 14. April 1354.
Such a dating can likely be narrowed down even further, though, as Hans Olrik´s abovementioned suggestion seems highly likely. The deacon Trugot of Århus mentioned in the legend as a contemporary person must be presumed to be the same man as the canon Trugot of Århus known in 1345. This particular name, Trugot, does not seem to have been common enough in Denmark during that era to expect it as highly probable that two persons of that same name were very likely to have been in office in Århus diocese at the same time. The fact that the younger holy Niels text describes deacon Trugot as a contemporary man who studied in Paris at the time of writing is thus probably decisive. Since Trugot had become a canon by 1345, the younger holy Niels text was probably written before 1345 while he was only still a deacon. His studies in Paris, as well as his later advancement as canon, is thus most likely explained by yet another preserved document from 29.3.1345 stating that Århus diocese had a rule demanding that all newly elected canons of Århus diocese had to study for 2 years at a university before they could receive the benefits of any of the estates belonging to the holy chapter of Århus diocese. The university studies of deacon Trugot in Paris thus probably took place at some point before 1345 so that he was able to advance and become canon, when he came back to Denmark, and subsequently also receive the estates attached to the position. 
All in all, the younger text about the holy Niels of Århus, was therefore probably written after 15. Oktober 1325 (the last mention of cantor Jakob), but before c. 1345 when Trugot is known to have advanced and become a canon.

As for the text itself, the younger saint´s legend about the holy Niels of Århus does not the follow the normal somewhat stricter structure of hagiography. It is a structurally loose collection of anecdotes from his life and miracle stories from after his death. The sources of the writer for his text seem to have been twofold: some parts of the text he copied from a long lost manuscript in Danish which he found in the rectory of the still preserved Skejby village church in Århus diocese. These parts he then must have translated from Danish into latin. Other parts of the younger holy Niels text are much more likely to have been based on the recollections of senior members of the holy chapter and older clergymen in office at Århus diocese. 
The younger text is thus not a classic hagiographic text as much as it is composite collection of anecdotes and miracle stories deemed worthy of remenbrance by the author.
As for the holy Niels himself, he was a Danish prince who died in 1180.  He was of royal blood as son of king Knud III of Denmark, who had been murdered by the henchmen of a rival king during a civil war in 1157. Niels appears in a few contemporary documents, but other than that not much is known about his life apart from what is told in the two preserved texts about him.",1325,1345,1895,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-03-16 15:32:26.155 +0100,2023-06-03 09:51:12.602 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1694,Christianity in Byzantium: Between the Schism and the Fourth Crusade,43,Religious Group (v6),"Even after the schism of 1054, there were still friendly relations between the Eastern and the Western Churches. The two parts of Christendom were not yet conscious of a great gulf of separation between them in many respects, such as them (a) ecclesiological dimension of the East–West schism which revolved around the authority of bishops within their dioceses and the lines of authority between bishops of different dioceses. It is common for Catholics to insist on the primacy of Roman and papal authority based on patristic writings and conciliar documents. (b) The papal privilege and authority, (c) theological issues such as the filioque, (d) Original sin, free will and the Immaculate Conception etc. There was no single event that marked the breakdown. Rather, the two churches slid into and out of schism over a period of several centuries, punctuated with temporary reconciliations. When Emperor Alexios Komnenos asked some thirty years after the schism whether a canonical decision had been made to break relations with Rome, the participants of the synod of the Church of Constantinople refused. 
In the 11th century the Empire experienced a major disaster. Most of its heartland territory in Anatolia was lost to the Seljuk Turks following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. At the same time, the empire lost its last territory in Italy to the Norman Kingdom of Sicily and faced repeated attacks in the Balkans. However, a period of secure dynastic rule begun by the Komnenos dynasty, under Alexios I (1081-1118), John II Komnenos (1118-43) and Manuel I Komnenos (1143-1180). These emperors were able to partially restore the empire's fortunes, but they never were able to fully reverse the damage caused by the instability at the end of the 11th century, nor return the empire's frontiers to those of 1071. After the battle of Mantzikert and the civil war that followed, Alexios I Komnenos rose to the throne and had call to the West for help, which led to the First Crusade. However, economic concessions to the Italian republics of Venice and Genoa weakened the empire's control over its own finances, while tensions with the West led to the Sack of Constantinople by the forces of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and the dismemberment of the empire.",1054,1204,1897,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-03-22 19:55:54.027 +0100,2023-04-06 10:59:17.169 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1695,"Xiaojing ""Classic of Filial Piety""",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Throughout the history of imperial China, members of the political elite have held the Xiaojing 孝經 (Classic of Filial Piety) in high esteem.  During the Eastern Han (A.D. 25-220), every government school had a lecturer on this text.  Emperors often expounded on the classic, ordered that commentaries be written for it, and had the scripture engraved in stone.  One emperor, Emperor Tang Xuanzong 唐玄宗 (r. 712-756), even penned a commentary on it himself.   During the Northern Song 北宋 (960-1127), the dynasty’s two greatest statesmen, Wang Anshi 王安石 (1021-1086) and Sima Guang 司馬光 (1019-1086), who were enemies, each wrote a treatise favoring a different version of the text.  When northerners conquered China, the Xiaojing was one of the first books they translated into their native language.  The Xiaojing quickly made its way to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, where it became essential reading for the upper class.  

Ironically, two of the features that made the Xiaojing philosophically shallow, but culturally important were its brevity and simplicity.  It is only 1800 Chinese characters long; moreover, it repeatedly uses the same 388 characters.  Thus, one merely had to learn 400 characters to be able to read the text.  This meant that it was very easy to learn and memorize, which made it one of the first texts that a student would read in trying to master the classical language.  This guaranteed that the Xiaojing was widely known and easily distributed.  Its simple language also meant that it could. serve as both a primer and a catechism.  Hence, in medieval China, the Xiaojing was the first true book that a student would study.  In fact, in pre-modern East Asia, nearly any person who was educated in literary Chinese was almost certainly familiar with this text.  During the Tang (618-907) and the Northern Song (960-1127), civil service examination candidates had to study this work.  From the Southern Song (1127-1279), the text lost its valence among male members of the upper class; instead, it was used to educate children, women, and farmers.  In the late Ming (1368-1643), it once again found importance among male literati, particularly thinkers who emphasized the unity of the Three Religions (Sanjiao he yi 三教合一).  These men emphasized the work’s religious aspects, especially its abilities to bring about response from the spirits (gantong shenming 感通神明).  During the Qing (1644-1911), the Xiaojing once again came into vogue and became a text that had to be memorized for taking the civil service examinations.

Given its title, one would expect the text to say much about what it is and how one should practice filiality.  Interestingly though, the Xiaojing says little about the particulars of being filial.  Clearly then, it was not meant as a handbook on the practice of this virtue.  The Xiaojing’s most significant insight is that one’s obligations to the family and the state are the same and not mutually exclusive.  In other words, the Xiaojing attempts to resolve the dilemma between whether one should be loyal to his family or the state.  It does so by unequivocally maintaining that no such conflict exists. That is because filial sons cannot but be loyal retainers.  The text stakes this claim on three ideas: 1. That filiality naturally becomes loyalty.  2.  Sons can only complete their filiality by serving as officials.  And 3. how one acts in the home will automatically become how one acts within the state.  Another way in which the text indicates that a son must be a loyal servitor is by maintaining that official service is needed to complete filiality.  Taking care of one’s parents, when they are alive and after their death, is critically important; nevertheless, according to the Xiaojing, these acts still do not completely realize filiality.  That can only be done by glorifying their memory.  The best way to do this is by perfecting one’s conduct and serving in public office.  Serving in government is a surefire way of bringing honor to their names.  

Another significant theme that the Xiaojing advocates is filiality’s metaphysical significance.  According to the text, filial piety is not merely one amongst many virtues.  It is the foundational virtue from which all others issue.  Even more importantly, it is not merely a secular virtue: it is a metaphysical principle that links people with Heaven and Earth, i.e. the universe.  In short, due to filiality’s metaphysical importance, if a ruler devotes his attention to it, he can gain supernatural protection for both his person and his state.  Consequently, during the early medieval period and the late Ming, the Xiaojing was a holy text that could be used to cure illnesses, obtain religious merit, repel evil spirits, and even enemy armies.",-230,1911,1898,671,Keith Knapp,2023-03-23 02:42:44.262 +0100,2023-05-19 19:10:47.633 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Neolithic, Mycenaean, and Geometric pottery have been found at the site, but evidence for the start of the Olympian cult of Zeus does not appear until the early 6th century BCE. The Sanctuary hosted the ""Panhellenic"" Nemean Games in honor of Zeus after 573 BCE. These were administered by Cleonae and later by Argos. The Sanctuary experienced a significant destruction event at the end of the 5th century, but was rebuilt under Macedonian patronage in the 330s BCE, including the Hellenistic phases of the Temple of Zeus and Stadium (relocated a quarter mile to the southeast). Another destruction occurred in the 270s BCE, and the Nemean Games were moved to Argos, with the exception of Aratus of Sicyon's infamous counter games in 235 BCE.

1697,Stylite Monks,43,Religious Group (v6),"Stylites were Christian monks who followed in the tradition of the 5th century saint Symeon Stylites the Elder. Symeon, after enduring many years of asceticism on the ground, began living atop high, narrow columns in modern-day Syria. These columns restricted the movement of the saint, so that he could practice an even more rigorous asceticism than he could on the ground, and they allowed the saint to remain more withdrawn from society. Other monks began imitating Symeon almost immediately, and a number of monks still live atop columns today. The highest concentration of stylite monks remained in Syria, but stylites were also present in other regions, such as Cappadocia and Georgia, and numerous stylite saints were recorded in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Various saints’ lives (hagiographies) attach symbolic meaning to the columns used by stylite saints. Most notably, they may have symbolized the upward movement of monks towards the celestial paradise. Stylites sometimes had a role in affairs on the secular ground, as well, and their spiritual authority was often transferred to social or even political power. For example, Symeon Stylites the Elder once solved a conflict between Theodoret of Cyrus, an important theologian and historian, and the patriarch of Antioch. In Constantinople and the surrounding areas towards the end of the 5th century, the emperor Leo I was a regular visitor of the stylite Daniel, who became, therefore, the spiritual advisor to the political head of state. Later, especially starting in the late 6th century and early 7th century, stylite monks  offered their voices to heated debates between Chalcedonian christians and monophysites, particularly Antiochian stylites, often siding with the latter.",450,1450,1626,1400,Elizabeth Zanghi,2023-03-24 13:48:25.824 +0100,2023-10-07 17:04:58.515 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1698,Biographies of Eminent Monks,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The ‘Biographies of Eminent Monks’ (高僧傳; ‘Gaoseng Zhuan’) is a compilation of the lives of over 500 Buddhist figures from 67 CE to 519 CE. This 14-chapter volume became the widely accepted basis for Chinese Buddhist, historical biography literature from the 6th century CE onwards. Extending from China’s first interactions with Buddhism to the Liang Dynasty, the text of ‘The Biographies of Eminent Monks’ discusses Buddhist figures that were well known during the time of Shi Huijiao (慧皎) (497-554 CE), the compiler and author. 

Huijiao was originally from the district of Shangyu in Kuaiji, an administrative region located to the south of Hangzhou Bay. He trained to be a scholar monk and practiced at Jiaxiang Temple on Kuaiji Mountain (now Xianglu Mountain), where he eventually began work on his ‘Biographies of Eminent Monks’. According to Shi Daoxuan’s (道宣) ‘Supplement to the Biographies of Eminent Monks’ (續高僧傳; ‘Xu Gaoseng Zhuan’), Huijiao preached consistently during the spring and summer and wrote commentaries during the fall and winter. He only worked on historical research and compilation for the biographies in his spare time between reading religious texts and attending lectures.

In his postface to the ‘Biographies of Eminent Monks’, Huijiao describes the wide breadth of sources he used to compile this text. He compares the different compilations of biographies prior to his own work, criticizing their “lack of proof” and the fact that they “leave a great deal of information absent.” Huijiao explains that he used oral testimony from elders and historical and geographical works from most of the historical dynasties mentioned throughout the ‘Biographies of Eminent Monks’ to supplement the previously-written hagiographies of Buddhist figures. Although he never directly compares himself to a historian in his postface, scholars have generally determined that, based on his methods and tone, Huijiao did believe he was a Buddhist historian improving on previous hagiographical works. This compilation was meant to act as an example for how Buddhist biographies were meant to be written in Huijiao’s eyes. He removes the “undeserved compliments and repetition” while focusing on the “abandonment of glory and affection” in the lives of eminent figures.

The text itself, consisting of 14 chapters, has 13 chapters of biographies and a final chapter with Huijiao’s postface. The biographies are divided into 10 categories: scriptural translation (1), doctrinal exegesis (2), supernatural powers (3), meditative practice (4), Vinaya exhortation (5), self-immolation (6), scriptural recitation (7), benevolent cause (8), scriptural intoners (9), and recitation guides (10). Each section ends with a short commentary by Huijiao that ties together the themes of the biographies. This new structure, combined with Huijiao’s gathered prose, made it one of the most popular sources of Buddhist hagiography in China, surpassing all previous biographical compilations. In fact, this structure was used as the basis for later compilations of Chinese Buddhist biographies. Daoxuan’s ‘Supplement to the Biographies of Eminent Monks’ and Zanning’s (贊寧) ‘Biographies of Eminent Monks in the Song Dynasty’ (宋高僧傳; ‘Song Gaoseng Zhuan’) were two of the most influential later texts.",67,519,1900,1408,Edward A S Ross,2023-03-24 16:38:03.498 +0100,2023-05-06 20:25:34.849 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1700,The Book of Hosea,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Hosea is one of the prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible, and the first book of the Minor Prophets as listed in the Masoretic text and the Septuagint. The book of Hosea featured prominently in the Qumran community, as three manuscripts of Hosea were found at Qumran (4Q78-79, 4Q82) as well as fragments of a “Pesher Hosea” (4Q166-167). The book contains 14 chapters, the first of which offer a narrative account of the prophet Hosea followed by poetic oracles and sayings attributed to him. Hosea was a northern prophet who, according to the superscription in 1:1, operated in the Northern Kingdom around the time leading up to its fall in 722 BCE. Although much of the book focuses on the 8th century Northern Kingdom, the book also includes references to Judah that likely reflect a later historical period. References to the nation of Judah and allusions to its fall in 586 BCE lead scholars to conclude that the book of Hosea was likely composed over a long period of time, beginning with the 8th century prophetic sayings, and continuing into the 6th century and beyond, as those words became reinterpreted for a primarily Judean exilic and post exilic audience. In reception history, the book of Hosea is most well-known for its coinage of the “marriage metaphor.” In the opening chapter of the book, Yahweh commands Hosea to take Gomer, a woman of zonah, often translated “whoredom,” as his wife. This troubled marriage is meant to reflect the fracturing relationship between Yahweh, the husband, and his wife, Israel. While the marriage metaphor is only loosely operative in the chapters following Hosea 1-3, later biblical authors such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Paul of the New Testament take up and expand the metaphor in their later writings (Jeremiah 1-3, Ezekiel 16 and 23, Romans 9). Moreover, Jewish and Christian commentators later interpreted the relationship of the couple in the Song of Songs in light of the marriage metaphor, leading them to liken the young couple to Yahweh and Israel, or Christ and the church. In recent scholarship, the marriage metaphor has been addressed by feminist scholars who point out the issues, theologically, politically, and socially, with the way the marriage metaphor depicts woman as a stand-in for sin, infidelity, and impurity. The disturbing imagery and implications of this metaphor serve the rhetorical efforts of the prophet, who sought to emphasize the fractured nature of Israel’s relationship with its god, Yahweh.",-800,-500,1901,1380,Morganne Ottobre,2023-03-25 18:46:45.484 +0100,2023-03-25 18:53:26.857 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1701,The Premonstratensian Order in the Middle Ages,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Premonstratensians are a reformed monastic order which emerged in northern France in the first quarter of the twelfth century. From the mother abbey of Prémontré, which was established under the leadership of Norbert of Xanten (c. 1075-1134) and Hugues of Fosses (c. 1093-1164), the order spread widely across Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The Premonstratensians observed the Rule of St Augustine, with significant influence from the Cistercian Order in terms of their mode of life and internal governance. The male members of the order were canons; while in some parts of Europe such as France, they often practiced a more contemplative form of life, in other regions they were frequently involved in pastoral care and preaching. In what is today northeastern Europe and western Poland, they played a prominent role in the conversion of peoples there to Christianity. Women were prominent members of the order in the first two centuries or so of its existence. They generally referred to themselves as “sisters” rather than as “canonesses”, however. Premonstratensian communities were organized in a number of circaries, roughly equivalent to ecclesiastical provinces.",1120,2023,1902,1418,Yvonne Seale,2023-03-25 22:11:41.671 +0100,2023-07-09 01:36:49.308 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1703,Arsenites,43,Religious Group (v6),"On Christmas 1261 the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos had his eleven-year-old co-emperor John IV Laskaris blinded (thus losing the ability to claim the throne), exiled and imprisoned in Bithynia. This action led to Michael’s excommunication by the patriarch Arsenios and, subsequently, to the Arsenite schism. Three years after his excommunication, the emperor deposed and exiled Arsenios, and in 1266 he enthroned Germanos III at the patriarchate. As a result, the former patriarch’s supporters, the Arsenites, who considered his deposition uncanonical, refused to recognise any of the following patriarchs, considering their election invalid and illegal, and broke away from the church, remaining loyal to Arsenios and the Laskarids. This is why the movement was more influential in Asia Minor, while its social character should also be noted, as it mainly represented the lower social strata that had been favoured by Theodore II Laskaris, along with its political motives, since the Arsenites opposed Michael’s usurpation of the throne, his indifference to the eastern provinces, and his ecclesiastical, economic and pro-aristocratic policy, alongside his role in the patriarch’s enthronement and the extent to which an emperor could intervene in ecclesiastical affairs.

Germanos soon resigned and was replaced by Joseph I who lifted Michael’s excommunication, causing a conflict between his supporters, the Josephites, and the Arsenites. After Andronikos II, Michael’s son, succeeded to the throne, he deposed the current unionist patriarch Bekkos and reinstated Joseph, thus giving control of the ecclesiastical affairs to the Josephites and at the same time embittering the Arsenites. Although they presented a greater threat though, Joseph had crowned Andronikos co-emperor, and therefore questioning the legality of his election would be impossible. After his death in 1283, Andronikos tried to compromise the two factions by choosing the scholar Gregory II of Cyprus for the patriarchate, thinking he would be accepted by both of them; both sides though opposed him, while the Arsenites were disappointed and felt deceived by the emperor.

During Gregory’s tenure, an effort was made to reconcile the two parties and bring the Arsenites, whose power had grown, back into the official church. In 1284 Andronikos convoked a church synod at Atramyttion, where it was eventually decided that it was up to God to judge which of them should rule the church by casting into a fire two volumes, each containing their opinions, and considering the one that would not be burnt the worthiest. As both were immediately burnt though, the two parties were temporarily appeased and agreed to accept Gregory. The following day though some of the most adamant Arsenites regretted this. As the members of the movement were divided into two groups, with the leading one emphasising its religious character and wishing to eventually gain positions in the church, and the majority of the members being interested in punishing those they considered to have sinned and prioritising a political opposition to the Palaiologoi, the emperor approached the former, and they agreed to accept the jurisdiction of the patriarchate of Constantinople on the condition that all the ordinations made by Bekkos would be annulled and those who had persecuted the Arsenites would be deposed.

At the same time, the Arsenite movement had grown in Constantinople and its political nature was strengthened as it spread within the city, where anti-Latin and anti-Unionist sentiments prevailed and the people were also faced with heavy taxation and state arbitrariness, something that made their turn to the Arsenites, who were leading the social struggles of the time, easier. According to a letter to the emperor by the patriarch, they could freely gather in public places and propagate their ideas, convert new members even by force and defy the official church’s rules. It seems that the party had gradually become one of simple opposition to the Palaiologoi and the official church, a religious, political and social movement that would often participate in riots and anti-government conspiracies. Andronikos however kept trying to reunite them, but they argued that they should take control of the church in order to cleanse it, as they had never been excommunicated, and that if their leader became patriarch, they would return to the official church. Subsequently, the emperor allowed them to bring the body of Arsenios in Constantinople in order to rebury it with the honours appropriate for a patriarch, granted them the monastery of Mosele and later visited John Laskaris in Asia Minor and ameliorated his living conditions. The Arsenites though were still not satisfied, and in 1289 they contributed to Gregory’s resignation, again hoping that one amongst them would be elected. Nevertheless, their demands, which included the election of a patriarch from their ranks, the removal of Joseph’s name from the diptychs, the restoration of orthodoxy and the cancellation of previous excommunications, were so extreme that Andronikos could not accept them, and finally chose the monk Athanasios to be the next patriarch.

The emperor was again under the impression that the latter would be accepted by both parties, but the Arsenites felt discontent, while Athanasios was also intransigent in dealing with them. He soon became very unpopular and abdicated in 1293. His successor was the more compromising monk John XII Kosmas, who, however, was also received with opposition, came into conflict with the emperor and eventually resigned in 1303. Andronikos negotiated with the Arsenites in order to appoint a patriarch they would approve, and they nominated an elderly bishop who had been ordained while Arsenios was patriarch and urged the emperor to overlook some of his irregularities since he had not taken part in any religious scandal. Although he initially agreed, he soon recalled Athanasios to the patriarchate because he was impressed by his prophetic abilities and because he wanted him to get an earlier implied anathema lifted, leaving the Arsenites feeling deceived once again.

However, Athanasios’ attitude towards the Arsenites had not changed, and therefore Andronikos’ attempts to reunite them with the Byzantine church failed. In 1304 he called their leaders to a synod where he blamed them for dividing both the church and the society despite all his efforts and good will, and stated that since they did not question the doctrine, they had to obey the official hierarchy. Although some Arsenites claimed that they were only interested in the official church’s purification and insisted that it was heretical because of its common liturgy with the Westerners, Andronikos asked them to return to the church and warned them that otherwise the responsibility for the schism would fall solely on them. However, they were not convinced and the council ended without an agreement. Eventually, the emperor decided that in order to end the controversy he had to replace Athanasios with a more compromising patriarch. In September 1309 the latter resigned, and in 1310, after lengthy negotiations with the Arsenites, he was replaced by Niphon.

By that time the Arsenites had been weakened due to the loss of many territories, and therefore followers, in Asia Minor, and wished to return to the official church as they had realised that their opposition to it was leading nowhere. Since both Andronikos and Niphon also wanted to heal the schism, the Arsenites presented their terms which included repudiation of any other dogma, cancellation of earlier excommunications, removal of any members of the clergy that had practiced simony and of those that had been ordained by Bekkos, removal of Joseph’s name from the diptychs, and guarantee that neither John XII nor Athanasios would be allowed to become patriarchs again. As they did not insist on their demand for the election of one of their number to the patriarchate, they indirectly recognised the legitimacy of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Palaiologan dynasty, a great relief for the emperor, who, until then, always had to take them into account whenever he made a political decision. The settlement took place in 1310 during a ceremony at Hagia Sophia, where Arsenios’ corpse was brought and set up, dressed in patriarchal clothes and holding a document, according to which his excommunications were revoked, and the terms of their agreement, which Andronikos approved for the sake of ecclesiastical peace, were confirmed. The most intransigent among the Arsenites and the followers of the official church disagreed, while some of the former were again separated because they did not get the offices they wanted and which had been promised to them by Niphon; any reactions however were not taken into account. Thus, after forty-five years, the Arsenite schism that had divided both church and society and embodied religious, political and social phenomena, was resolved, and at the same time a danger to the church and the state was eliminated.",1265,1310,1904,1383,PHOEBE GEORGIADI,2023-03-27 13:09:34.809 +0200,2023-03-27 13:12:57.337 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1704,Temple of Athena Alea,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Temple of Athena Alea was an important sanctuary in the territory of Tegea, one of the leading city-states within the region of Arcadia in the Peloponnese.  The significance of the cult for the Tegeans is seen in the use of the words ''Athana Alea"" on their fourth century BCE coinage. 

Alea was likely a separate goddess that synchronised with Athena in the Archaic period (Jost 2007 270).  According to Pausanias, (8.4.8), the temple was founded by Aleos, son of the local hero Apheidas.  The name Aleos is clearly etymologically related to Alea and is likely a later genealogical reproduction to explain the origin of the temple in a time when Alea was established as an epithet of  Athena. 

Cults of Athena is Alea is also found at Mantinea,   Alea, and in Sparta.

1705,The Historia Compostellana,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Historia Compostellana is an episcopal biography (or gesta) of the twelfth-century bishop (and later archbishop) Diego Gelmírez (c.1070-1140). It is also the foundation history for the bishopric of Santiago de Compostela, a city in the north-western corner of the Iberian Peninsula. It was written between 1109-1148 and covers the years 1088-1139.

The Historia Compostellana posits Diego Gelmírez as the city’s patron and protector, narrating how the bishop successfully overcame the challenges of his time. It details: the political and cultural zenith of medieval Santiago de Compostela, the city’s place within the multipolar conflicts of twelfth-century Iberia, Church reform, Christian expansion into Andalusian lands, investiture disputes, and the rise of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage phenomenon and the cult of St James.

The Historia Compostellana is also a foundational document for the episcopal seat of Santiago de Compostela, establishing a new canonical history for the city and the see. In creating this history, the work’s compilers invented, destroyed, and synthesised pre-existing history. Their intention was to forge a new past, one congenial to the contemporary needs of the city and its see. The result was a foundation myth that ideologically aligned Santiago de Compostela with Rome, while also burying certain inconvenient historical truths.

With respect to genre, the Historia Compostellana is a serial record, that is, a dynamic compendium of narrative texts and archival documentation that uses texts from a broad range of genres in order to narrate and evidence an historical account.

Commissioned by Bishop Diego himself, the Historia Compostellana was written in three phases and by three of his acolytes, namely, Munio Alfonso, Gerald of Beauvais, and Pedro Marcio, all of whom held senior positions within Santiago de Compostela’s cathedral chapter at different times. Each of these compilers worked with distinct editorial visions and within different socio-political contexts. As such, the final product has a polyphonic quality that at times borders on incoherence.

The Historia Compostellana also has an explicit three book structure ¬– a structure that does not line up with the breaks in authorship ¬– with the first book covering the years prior to Compostela’s elevation to the archiepiscopate in 1120, the second detailing Diego’s glory years, and the third recounting his senescence and demise.

Along with works such as the Codex Callixtinus and the Tumbo A, the Historia Compostellana represents the literary efflorescence of Santiago de Compostela’s medieval golden cultural age.",1088,1148,1906,1415,James Kawalek,2023-03-28 17:05:53.119 +0200,2023-04-02 02:56:58.252 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1706,Virú State Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Virú State was a first-generation state (i.e., a state formation that evolves without contact with other states, see Spencer 2010) that developed in the Virú Valley, North Coast of Peru, between about 200 BCE and 700 CE. This state first unified the Virú Valley into a single political entity, establishing a four-tiered settlement hierarchy.  At
the top of this settlement hierarchy was the political capital of the Gallinazo Group, a large (ca. 10,000-14,000 people) urban center featuring civic-ceremonial and residential structures. In the first four centuries CE, the state expanded northward to the Moche and Chicama valleys, establishing a number of outposts. The development and growth of the huaca centers following Moche ideology (see Quilter and Koons 2012) caused the retreat of the Virú State in its homeland. Towards the end of its trajectory (ca. 500-700 CE), possible social and political changes led to the emergence of a new political center in the valley Huancaco, which was abandoned after a strong El Niño event (Bourget 2003; Bourget 2010; Downey 2014; Espinosa et al. 2021; Millaire 2010; Millaire and Eastaugh 2011; Millaire and Eastaugh 2014; Millaire et al. 2016).

1711,International Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"International Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji (DBZ) is a Rinzai Zen Buddhist Training Monastery located on Beecher Lake in the Catskill Mountains, New York, USA. The monastery is maintained by the Zen Studies Society, Inc. (ZSS), an organization originally established in 1956 by Cornelius Crane (d. 1962) to support the translation work of Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki (1870—1966). However, the monastery and ZSS’s zen centre, New York Zendo Shobo-ji, were built and created by the second iteration of ZSS, which was led by the work of Eido Tai Shimano Roshi (1932—2018) from 1965 to 2010. 

When the monastery land was first purchased in 1971, teachers and students connected to ZSS gathered in the autumn for their first five-day sesshin (meditation retreat) on the property. This included Eido Roshi’s teacher, Soen Nakagawa Roshi (1907—1984), who was made abbot of DBZ and Shobo-ji that year. 

Meditation retreats and residencies would take place in Beecher House, also called Joraku-an, during their early stays on the property, as the monastery was still under construction. Beecher House is situated alongside Beecher Lake, and it was previously owned by Henry Ward Beecher, the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the abolitionist and author of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’. During the initial retreats on the property, a zendo and dharma hall were constructed in the building, and a mural depicting the events of the ‘Flower Sermon’ was painted on a ground floor wall by Soen Roshi’s friend Father Maxima. 

William Johnstone (1899—1983) was named the chairman of the building committee for the monastery in 1971, and Davis Hamerstrom was selected as the architect. After a visit to Japan with Eido Roshi, Hamerstrom selected Tofuku-ji in Kyoto as the model for the future DBZ. Construction on the monastery was completed in 1975, and the building was dedicated for zen practice on August 9th, 1975. During this time, Soen Roshi, Nyogen Senzaki (1876—1958), Chester Carlson (1906—1968), Jimmy Tanahashi, Haku’un Yasutani Roshi (1885—1973), D. T. Suzuki, and William Johnstone were identified as the founders of DBZ. The building was officially opened on July 4th, 1976 with many of these founders present, and the monastery has been used for residential zen training ever since.

Eido Roshi continued as abbot of ZSS and DBZ for 37 years, but this period perpetuated an endemic culture of secrecy surrounding his sexual misconduct with his students. In 2010, the Board of ZSS asked Eido Roshi to step down as abbot, and on December 8th, 2010 he retired in response to the board’s request. 

Shinge Roko Sherry Chayat Roshi (b. 1943), one of Eido Roshi’s dharma heirs, was installed as abbot of ZSS and DBZ on January 1st, 2011. She led the sangha with compassion and wisdom, teaching her numerous students through zazen and koan practice, until her retirement on October 1st, 2023. Although Shinge Roshi continues to be an active teacher at DBZ, she has passed the abbotship on to one of her dharma heirs, Chigan Roland Jaeckel Roshi (b. 1962).
 
DBZ continues to be an active place for zen practice and retreat. Visitors and students of Zen Buddhism can come to the monastery for Intro to Zen weekends, 7-day sesshins, 3-month kessei (residential stays), and summer internships. The Open Space Program at the Beecher House also welcomes a wide variety of retreats who want to experience the peace of Dai Bosatsu Mountain in America. With support from visitors and external donors, Beecher House was renovated in 2021, and the main monastery building will be renovated following a funding campaign in 2023-2024.",1976,2023,1912,1408,Edward A S Ross,2023-04-05 02:44:04.262 +0200,2023-12-18 19:01:43.368 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1720,Samten Hills Dalat,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"While Samten Hills is certainly a religious place -- arguably the most lavish Tibetan Buddhist temple complex in Vietnam -- there is a definitional ambiguity that makes it difficult to nail down. Simply put, Samten Hills means different things to different people. At the most basic, Samten Hills is a luxury tourist resort that promises 'Relax. Reflect. Renew' (according to the motto). It is built on rolling hills outside of Đà Lạt city in the Central Highlands, an area known for romantic nature (due to French colonial hill stations and local ethnic minority groups) and spiritual power emanating from the mountains. Samten Hills has has high-end villas, restaurants, cafes and shops, along with hundreds of campsites for those seeking a more rustic experience. In that sense, it is a for-profit business. However, the 'heart of Samten Hills' is Samten Ling, a Tibetan Buddhist temple operated by monks from the Drikung Kagyu lineage. Those monks come mostly from Lamayuru Temple in Ladakh (India). As a temple, Samten Ling has a resident rinpoche (Sonam Jorphel Rinpoche), monks and various attendants. Beginning in February 2023, during a 2-week inauguration, they hosted many Vajrayana empowerments. Samten Ling is also home to some large religious objects, including Tibetan Buddhist statues and the newly-minted Guinness record world's largest gold-plated prayer wheel. The ambiguity is about terminology: some people consider Samten Hills to be a tourist business that facilitates the temple; others consider it to be a temple that entices tourism. Officially, Samten Hills is (allegedly) registered as a business or heritage museum. As a Vajrayana place, is not registered as a temple within the officially government recognized Vietnam Buddhist Sangha. It is sometimes officially called a “spiritual and cultural space for Vajrayana Buddhism in Vietnam” and a ""cultural and spiritual center Samten Hills."" The polysemy of Samten Hills has only intensified since the completion of the March 2023 inauguration, as the place has come under official investigation for functioning as a religious place (allegedly) against the stated purpose of the land agreement, which was framed within “forestation and management, grass planting and dairy farming, in combination with cultural and touristic experiences at Tu Tra commune.” This entry is based on fieldwork at Samten Hills during the Inauguration period and interviews with over 60 Vajrayana followers and Samten Hills employees.",2023,2023,1925,576,Stephen Christopher,2023-04-11 14:45:50.203 +0200,2023-05-24 16:45:07.734 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1721,Tell Fekheriyeh Inscription,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Tell Fekheriyeh is an archeological site identified as the ancient city of Sikan (located in modern day Syria); an Aramean city thought to be an important cult site for the storm god Hadad. Sikan (and neighboring sites) fell under Neo-Assyrian control around the first half of the 9th century BCE. In February 1979, the Tell Fekheriyeh statue was discovered accidentally by a farmer in the southwest corner of Tell Fekheriyeh and today the statue stands at the National Museum of Damascus. Although the precise date of the statue is debated, most scholars agree the statue most likely dates around the late 9th or early 8th centuries BCE. The Tell Fekheriyeh statue was carved from basalt and depicts a life-size man, standing roughly 1.65 meters tall. Inscriptions on the statue identify the man as Had-Yithi, an Aramean governor/king. To the untrained eye (aka non-art historians) the iconography and style of the statue appears to be firmly Neo-Assyrian. While there are some strong connections between the styles, there are some distinct variations that differentiate the Tell Fekheriyeh statue from statues we find in the heart of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (compare the 9th century statues of Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III). The man at Tell Fekheriyeh is carved with curly shoulder-length hair and a long curly beard. He is wearing a short-sleeve tunic with a fringe shawl that comes over his left shoulder and tucks into a fringe belt at his waist. The bottom of his tunic is lined with a similar fringe on the hem. His feet are carved with incredible detail (down to the cuticle) and his sandals are tied neatly with thongs. His hands are empty but come together across his chest in a benedictory pose. Unlike 9th century Neo-Assyrian iconography, the man does not wear any jewelry nor a headdress, and his tunic lacks ornamentation. However, down the man’s skirt is a lengthy bilingual inscription: an Akkadian text down the front, written in a vertical orientation, and an Old Aramaic translation written horizontally on the back. The Old Aramaic inscription is one of the oldest and most complete Aramaic texts, making it an invaluable resource for understanding the vocabulary, grammar, and syntax of the Old Aramaic language. The Akkadian inscription is also interesting, as this is the only example of a vertically oriented cuneiform text in the first millennium. The dress is completely covered in text from the fringe of the belt to the fringe of the hem. The genre of the inscription is understood as a dedicatory inscription that commemorates the dedication of the statue to the Aramean god, Hadad. Hadad was at the top of the Aramean pantheon and likely had a temple or cult center at Sikan. Hadad was a storm deity worshiped among various groups in both Mesopotamia (as Adad) and Syria since the second millennium BCE. The inscription suggests that Had-Yithi dedicated this statue to evoke the protection and blessing of Hadad over his life and his reign. The inscription also includes a lengthy list of curses against any who deface the statue or remove Had-Yithi’s name from upon it. While the cultic (or religious) function of the statue is unknown, the dedication and curses suggest the statue may have been a votive statue, meant to stand in for Had-Yithi at a temple of Hadad. While much remains unknown about the actual function of the statue and its inscription, the statue itself embodies a blending of Assyrian and Aramean traditions that likely reflects the reality of 9th century Sikan.",-890,750,1926,1380,Morganne Ottobre,2023-04-11 19:00:27.960 +0200,2023-04-27 18:54:27.002 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1723,The holy Niels of Århus (older text),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The text discusses the holy Niels of Århus, a Danish prince who died in 1180. He was of royal blood as the son of king Knud III of Denmark, who had been murdered by the henchmen of a rival king during a civil war in 1157. Niels appears in a few contemporary documents, but apart from that not much is known about his life except for what is told in the two preserved texts about him. He is remembered as a local Danish saint who was venerated in Århus diocese in Jutland during the middle ages. Two hagiographic texts are known about him: an older one and a younger one. Even though these two have been preserved together as part of a collective manuscript, it is necessary to distinguish between them as they are quite different not only in dating and in their individual background of creation, but also stylistically. Compared to the younger one, the older saint´s legend about the holy Niels of Århus follows the classic form of hagiography, structurally, much more than the younger one does. Originally the older text contained an introduction first, although now only the opening words are preserved of this. The bulk of the text describes his life and death followed by the description of almost a sort of episcopal translation of his body: although apparently not reflecting any such actual episcopal translation, this part of the text slightly imitates a translation story when it tells the miracle story about how his grave site was selected and approved by the bishop. The text then ends with a selection of miracle stories connected to his cult. Two papal letters demanding both the miraculous events and his saintliness to be examined are added at the end. As for dating the text, the two papal letters at the end are dated for 1254 and 1255, respectively. A miracle story speaks of abbot Vilhelm of Æbelholt monastery in Denmark in a way suggesting that this must have happened after the papal canonization of Vilhelm took place in 1224. The last group of miracle stories are also clearly dated between 1250 and 1252. Except for these miracle stories, though, there are few indications obviously dating his saint´s vita, although it does seem clear that it could not have been written until only several decades after his death. Therefore, the text as a whole has usually been dated for c. 1254-1255 as it was probably written to coincide with the application to the pope for the canonization of Niels. It is this application now reflected in the two preserved papal letters. The holy Niels was venerated in Århus diocese continuously throughout the middle ages, although he was never formally canonized by the church. His cult does, however, seem to have had a strong following amongst the people locally.",1254,1255,1929,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-04-12 14:50:24.582 +0200,2023-05-23 19:40:46.380 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1724,"Church of St. George, Embaros",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Located in the center of the village of Embaros in the Pediada Eparchy, the church of St. George in Embaros is a single nave construction with a pointed barrel vault. Divided into three bays, the raised transverse arches are decorated at each of their terminuses with a coat of arms on a red ground, presumably that of the donor’s family. The exterior is composed of exposed stone covered by a tiled gable roof. The primary entrance, located on the west side of the building, is framed by a pointed arch which once likely held a painting, now whitewashed. The roof is topped by a later belfry. A modern window has been inserted into the center of the north wall.
The village of Embaros, at the base of the Dikti Mountains, is one of the largest villages in the area with records of the village dating back to the early fourteenth century. Located in the valley of the Mparitis River, the region is lush with agricultural products from olive oil to wine production. Although agriculture is the primary occupation of the community, they are also well known for their ditany, or mountain tea.
The church of St. George, with its well-preserved frescoes, was commissioned by, according to the dedicatory inscription preserved on the west wall above an image of the archangel Michael, the contribution and efforts of the priest Manuel, his wife and children, along with several other Christians, during the reign of the emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425-48) in the year 6945 (1436-1437) and painted by the hand of Manuel Phokas. Although the wall paintings are damaged, they are of a high quality, reflecting the art of the major artistic centers of the Byzantine world.
The sanctuary is, today, separated by a modern wooden iconostasis built into the wall just beyond the easternmost transverse arch. Heavily damaged, the sanctuary wall paintings reveal only remnants of the figure of Christ Pantocrator in the apse, the Hospitality of Abraham in the upper part of the triumphal arch, and deacons and co-officiating bishops along the lower register. The sanctuary barrel vault is in better condition showing the scenes of the Pentecost and the Ascension. The apostles appear amidst ornate contemporary buildings and mountainous landscapes. Below these scenes, two additional scenes, the Incredulity of Thomas, on the south, and Christ Appearing to the Two Marys, on the north, are flanked to the west by an unidentifiable martyr (on the north) and an ornate floral pattern (on the south).
The nave, divided into two by a transverse arch decorated with busts of saints, includes three registers of narrative scenes from the Christological cycle and the Life and Martyrdom of St. George. The height of the church and the quality of the painting allows each scene to be rendered in fine detail with the figures positioned amidst dramatic land and cityscapes. The life of St. George includes six scenes from the life and martyrdom of the saint with the unusually combined scene of St. George in the Lime Pit and St. George in the Furnace. The lower register on both the north and south walls displays rows of saints framed under a red archway decorated with floral motifs. The northern wall includes the images of three female saints next to two medical saints, Sts. Cosmas and Damian, identified by their boxes of medicinal powders and ladles. Along the southern wall, unobstructed by the modern window are a similar row of standing saints, albeit badly preserved. Among these only the images of the Saints Constantine and Helena can be readily identified.
The western wall, heavily damaged, shows the Last Judgment with the outer figures from the Apostles Tribunal and the Angels Rolling up the Heavens visible on either side of the scene. To the left of the entrance the image of the Archangel Michael is framed below the dedicatory inscription. The scene of the Pool of Fire along with a few figures of the damned, albeit very damaged, is visible on the right side of the entrance.",1436,2023,1930,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-04-13 02:24:44.309 +0200,2023-05-23 19:17:01.700 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1725,The holy Anders of Slagelse,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The holy Anders of Slagelse was a Danish priest from the town of Slagelse. He became venerated as a saint in the area around Slagelse within Roskilde diocese in medieval Denmark after his death. Apparently he died in 1205. He was never officially canonized, but his cult remained popular amongst the people locally for centuries. This is pretty much all which is known about him. All other  information preserved on him stems from his saint´s legend and in this case the word legend really seems more appropriate than describing it as a saint´s vita. Not much trustworthy information on his actual life is to be found in the text. Instead it takes on a highly legendary character full of fantastic tales clearly reflecting that this was stories told about him amongst the people orally and that they circulated like this for a very long time until they were finally written down. The preserved late medieval text does not even follow the normal structure of hagiography as there is e.g. no mention of posthumous miracles, nothing said about his childhood or youth and not even any translation description. The preserved text was transmitted to the present day because it was later copied by a chaplain called Jakob Mosle from a church in Slagelse sometime around 1500. Jakob Mosle is not the author of it, though, but instead states openly that he merely copied an older manuscript. How old exactly this older manuscript was is unknown, but it is clearly reflected in the text that it could not have been written until quite a long time after Anders had died. Only one piece of information slightly indicates the age of the written text. Jakob Mosle states the he copied the text from an old piece of paper. The use of paper in Denmark instead of parchment makes it unlikely that writing took place before c. the mid-14th century. Thus it seems that this text about the holy Anders must have been written down sometime after c. 1350, but well before Jakob Mosle copied it around 1500. The fact that these stories about him really did circulate orally already long before his preserved saint´s legend was written down is known for certain, though, as an early version of one of these stories appear already in a book from around 1260 written by the Dominican friar Thomas of Cantimpré (1201-1272). Thomas of Cantimpré had probably heard this story from some anonymous Danish friar of his order, most likely a friar stemming from one of the friaries within Roskilde diocese. This Dominican book must be a story for another time, though, as the present entry will be about the text transmitted by Jakob Mosle exclusively.",1205,1536,1931,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-04-13 10:56:31.181 +0200,2023-04-28 15:42:29.498 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1729,Chùa Lâm Huê,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Chùa Lâm Huê epitomizes a small but growing trend in Vietnamese Mahayana temples to hybridize with Vajrayana aesthetics, rituals and teachings. It is located inside a small alleyway in Bình Thạnh District of Hồ Chí Minh City. Prior to the 1968 Tết Offensive bombings that decimated the area, the temple ground was reportedly triple in size. The initial land was bought and donated by Madame Lâm, an influential Hoa (Sino-Vietnamese) businesswoman who owned one of the biggest jewelry stores in Saigon in the 1940s. She donated the property to Thích Minh Tịnh, who was famously known as the first Vietnamese monk to study Vajrayana in Tibet with the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937. Chùa Lâm Huê is locally known for several reasons: its unique history and ties with Communist soldiers during the Vietnam War or more commonly referred to as the American War in Vietnam; the female-led organizational structure and the widespread affection for Sư bà, the head nun; the ability to attract many Tibetan teachers; and organizational independence--neither identifying with a specific Vajrayana sect nor joining the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam). The space is technically registered as a private residence and is a fascinating case study in hybridization, female-led spirituality in late-Socialist Vietnam and the Vajrayana boom in Southeast and East Asia more broadly. This entry is based on four months of fieldwork at the temple, interviews with Lâm Huê leadership, visiting Tibetan monks and dozens of Vietnamese followers. The temple has a complex relationship to the state, one side being a “red address” supporting Communists during the war, while on the other hand operating as an independent private spiritual institution outside the management of the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha; and to Vietnamese Mahayana. One could say that the temple is both Mahayana and Vajrayana. When no Tibetans are in residence, the temple functions like a Mahayana space, and several Vietnamese Buddhist groups rent out the temple for chanting and rituals. When Tibetans are in residence, the temple transforms into a Vajrayana ritual space and the Vajrayana architecture (prayer wheel and prayer flags) and iconography (statues and thangkas) synchronize with specific empowerments. During 4 months of fieldwork, we attended several empowerments, including a 3-day Medicine Buddha, 1-day Zambala puja and several fire pujas, and interviewed leadership, visiting Tibetans and Vietnamese followers.",1942,2023,1934,576,Stephen Christopher,2023-04-20 06:59:25.762 +0200,2023-05-08 02:55:36.791 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1732,Sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Brauron was an important religious site for the Athenians, particularly for women and young girls, between the 6th and 3rd centuries BCE. Prior to its usage as a sanctuary, Brauron was a flourishing settlement between 2000 and 1300 BCE. Subsequent to the abandonment of the site as a place of habitation, Brauron attained a high level of religious importance during the 6th century under the reign of the Peisistratids. Religious worship at Brauron predominantly focused on the Brauronian Artemis for her attributes as a goddess of childbirth and for guidance for the transition from childhood to marriage. Young girls, beginning around the age of seven, would participate in coming-of-age rituals at the site and call upon Artemis Brauronia during their first menstruation, marriage, and pregnancy. The two major festivals associated with this sanctuary, namely, the Brauronia and the Arkteia, are mainly attested by Aristophanes’ plays Lysistrata and Peace. Iphigenia also appears to have been an important figure of worship at Brauron, due to her connection as a sacrifice to the goddess in the events leading to the Trojan War. The extant Doric temple dates to approximately 500 BCE with a pillared porch with three interior rooms. North of the temple is a Doric stoa notable for its irregular Π shape and numerous dining (or sleeping) rooms. The irregular shape of the stoa coincides with the layout of the Brauroneion on the Athenian Acropolis, which replaced Brauron as the cult site for Artemis Brauronia after the sanctuary’s abandonment in the late 4th century BCE. To the west of the stoa is a stone bridge dating to the 5th century BCE, the only one of its kind found on mainland Greece according to Papadimitriou. Found in situ alongside the temple and stoa walls were rows of stelae bases that held inscriptions listing dedications and offerings given to the goddess dating from the mid-4th century BCE and later, copies of which were found in the Brauroneion on the Acropolis. Southeast of the temple is the so-called Heroon of Iphigenia. This heroon is a small, rock-cut shrine with evidence of the existence of rooms inside the cave. Located near the temple is a 16th century (CE) church dedicated to St. George. Following the Persians’ sacking of the site in 480 BCE and the flooding of the local Erasinos River, it appears the site never fully recovered, and the cult shifted to the Athenian Acropolis. An inscription dating to the 3rd century BCE attests to building inspections taking place following the flooding of the Erasinos River, however, the lack of repairs is further indication of the site’s abandonment.",-2000,-200,1938,1411,Tarryn Andrews,2023-04-22 02:13:16.535 +0200,2023-04-24 21:02:13.408 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1733,Công viên Hỏa táng Tháp Long Thọ (Long Thọ Cremation Park),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Long Thọ Cremation Park was constructed in 2014 and home to the Sakya Tsechen Shiday Choeling Vietnam temple (completed in 2018). The cremation park is an extraordinary business-temple that creatively negotiates state control of religious activity through their official registration as a business and their spiritual role in pacifying angry ghosts that linger in the area (Củ Chi) renown as an intense battlefield during the Vietnam-American War. Having a government-subsidized business that indirectly funds a proximate Tibetan Buddhist temple is a feature of Sakya Vietnam shared with the 2023 inaugurated Samten Hills Dalat. Likewise, both Vajrayana temples aim to be major hubs of Tibetan Buddhist practice in the current religious landscape in Vietnam. While they both have diverse followers, there is a notably large number of cosmopolitan, urban, young and progressive followers with backgrounds in English and business aims (thus accounting for the popularity of Zambala empowerments, the Tibetan wealth god). The Sakya Tsechen Shiday Choeling Vietnam temple is situated on the premise of the cremation park and is a fascinating construction based on the Sakya Vietnam principles of Tibetan Buddhism with Vietnamese characteristics. Leadership has carefully constructed the temple, ritual practice, specific teachings and hermeneutic emphases to incorporate aspects of Vietnamese traditions and spirituality. This is most evident in the prevalence of Đạo Mẫu and the creative transposition of Vietnamese folk religion onto Tibetan Buddhism. Accordingly, several Sakya Vietnam followers are skilled Đạo Mẫu practitioners and there is a recently-constructed Đạo Mẫu temple abutting the Sakya Tsechen Shiday Choeling Vietnam temple. In April 2023, the 41st Sakya Gongma Trichen Rinpoche came to Vietnam for the first time and performed several ritual events at the Sakya Tsechen Shiday Choeling Vietnam temple at the Long Thọ Cremation Park. This entry focuses on the fusion of business and spirituality (known as the ‘corporate form of religion’) that typifies both the cremation park-cum-temple and the broader objectives of elite normalization of this fledgling lineage in Vietnam. 
Sakya Vietnam was established in Hồ Chí Minh City in 1995. It represents a fusion of different interests and organizational styles. Much of the impetus came from a Vietnamese-American Vajrayana follower with close ties to the ‘Sakya Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism’ in Seattle. With the blessing of Sakya rinpoches in India and official recognition from the Dalai Lama’s office (see pictures), Sakya Vietnam has made several inroads into becoming an established lineage in Vietnam. It is currently under the spiritual guidance of Ngagpa Thạch Hồng Nghĩa Lộc (Ngawang Sonam), a young medical doctor who attracts youthful followers and guides them through Tibetan Buddhist rituals in the absence of a resident Tibetan monk. Sakya Vietnam began with a temple in an apartment in Hồ Chí Minh City’s District 7. Ornately decorated in Tibetan Buddhist style, with a hybrid Mahayana-Vajrayana altar and Sakya’s hallmark Ganapati image (one of the ‘Three Great Red Ones’), the apartment-cum-temple operates as a ritual and organizational space within the city. This entry, which focuses on a new diaspora Sakya lineage in Vietnam, is based on fieldwork conducted in 2022-23.",2014,2023,1939,576,Stephen Christopher,2023-04-22 05:26:00.378 +0200,2023-06-27 18:26:51.602 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1734,Cupisnique Culture Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Cupisnique culture developed along the North Coast of Peru (between the Lambayeque and the Nepeña valleys) during the Initial Period and the Early Horizon (ca. 1600-400 BCE). During this time frame, several ceremonial complexes composed of plazas surrounded by mounds were built in the Northern Peruvian valleys. While monumental complexes were also built in other parts of the Central Andean region during this period (i.e., Central Coast of Peru, Peruvian Central and Northern Highlands), the Northern Peruvian valleys were marked by the presence of specific architectural features (e.g., colonnades and wide stairways), and the use of black pottery produced in a range of styles. Research on the Cupisnique culture has been conducted since the 1940s (Larco 1945). Due to iconographic similarities with Chavín de Huántar, Cupisnique has been either labeled as a cultural expression that preceded and heavily influenced the emergence of the Early Horizon’s Chavín cult (Larco 1945) or a coastal version of Chavín (Tello 1943). Recent research (Burger and Salazar 2008) suggests that Cupisnique was a local development and that, along with other coastal, highland, and Amazonian sources, inspired Chavín cult and iconography. Jason Nesbitt (2012) also argued that the Cupisnique culture can be subdivided into two interacting sociopolitical units (“social fields”) that shared the same religious ideology. The Northern Cupisnique social field included the Lambayeque, Zaña, and Jequetepeque valleys, while the Southern Cupisnique social fields comprised the area between the Chicama and Nepeña valleys. Excavations conducted at ceremonial centers and coastal villages help us shed light on the religious practices of the people that occupied the North Coast of Peru during the Initial Period and the Early Horizon.",-1600,-400,1941,1198,Amedeo Sghinolfi,2023-04-25 21:05:55.783 +0200,2023-04-25 21:05:55.783 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1738,Taipei National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"In 1946, the Nationalist leadership began renovating the Taipei Shinto shrine into the National Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine to house the displaced spirits of the national dead. Renovated and renamed the National Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine in 1969, the structure served as the national altar of the Republic of China in exile. As the Martyrs’ Shrine establishes the sacrifice of life as the highest mark of citizenship, necrocitizenship ––posthumous membership in the national community–– is reserved for Nationalist stalwarts and those whose loyalty can be similarly construed. The National Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine is a fascinating example of how religion and state intersect in allegedly secular countries.

The shrine originated from Sun Yat-sen’s aspiration to commemorate the anti-imperial martyrs of the 1911 Republic and the Nationalist government’s attempt to marshal political allegiance during the Japanese invasion in the 1930s–1940s. Throughout the Cold War era, the spring and autumn sacrifices performed by the heads of state and visits to the shrine by foreign dignitaries served to affirm the sovereignty of the Republic of China over the People’s Republic of China. 

Even though the end of martial law in 1987 ushered in a new era marked by the Nationalist Party’s loss of political hegemony, the shrine continued to adhere to the Nationalist Party ideology and its commemoration of Nationalist version of history. Presidents of the Republic of China, Taiwan, regardless of their political affiliation, regularly perform worship at the shrine. The ceremonies include the spring and autumn sacrifices, enshrinement of martyrs, and paying homage to the Yellow Emperor and Sun Yat-sen. The palace-style compound is a site of contested sovereignty exaggerated by China’s extraordinary growth and Taiwan’s transforming identity. The enshrined ancestors of the Republic of China have also found a new role as both an assertion of Taiwan’s autonomy and a reflection of its dynamism in the international arena. Although the enshrinement of Republican-era heroes is part of the nation-building project under the Nationalist regime, these men also embody the struggle against imperialism (of China’s past) and authoritarianism (of China’s present).",1946,2023,1944,1435,Linh Vu,2023-05-01 23:17:14.938 +0200,2023-05-02 22:45:23.617 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

CE 668–69) and Hadrian the North African, Abbot of the Monastery of SS Peter and Paul, Canterbury (sed. CE 670–709/760). The School was located at Canterbury, the Primatial See of England and the heart of Roman Christianity in Britain, and constituted the principal monastic educational institution in Anglo-Saxon England. The group was formed of members of different local religious communities, ordinands from throughout the province, and scholars and clerics from further afield, namely Ireland, all of whom flocked to the Canterbury School because of the high quality of education available there. A number of generations of scholars, clergy, and professional religious personnel were trained at this centre of learning. The Canterbury School under its two illustrious masters represented a ‘golden age’ and an early high point – in England and early medieval Europe more broadly – for the study of Greek and Latin Patristics, Biblical exegesis, comparative Biblical-textual criticism, and erudite Christian learning, as the extant writings from the School attest.",669,690,1945,1422,John Gallagher,2023-05-03 00:06:51.239 +0200,2023-05-30 11:16:32.386 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1741,Methodism in Zimbabwe or Methodist Church in Zimbabwe,43,Religious Group (v6),"Methodism in Zimbabwe with particular reference to the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe (MCZ) is one of the largest early denominations in Zimbabwe that has its roots from John Wesley in England. Methodism has unique and distinctive doctrines, rituals, customs and belief systems that are a replica to their pastoral lifestyles. Methodist Church in Zimbabwe has a membership of plus or minus 123 262 members in Zimbabwe (MCZ Handbook 2023:167-168). The development of Methodism in Zimbabwe has its roots in Britain and South Africa who initiated the missionary propagation of the word of God from the North to the South. Today we are witnessing a reverse of the spreading of the gospel where the Southern hemisphere is now going as missionaries to the North to minister in the diaspora. Currently the Zimbabwean Methodist Conference is seconding ministers to work in the diaspora. There is a total membership of 2754 members in diaspora. 339 in Australia, 75 in Botswana, 75 in Canada, 95 in Ireland, 33 in Schengen, 1163 in South Africa, 36 in United Arab Emirates, 853 in United Kingdom and 85 in United States of America (MCZ Agenda of Conference 2023:R61). Taking the example of the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe alone one can deduce that the global south has penetrated the global north. The focus of this study will be from 1891-2023, which represents the time that the first missionaries settled in Zimbabwe and were given the mandate to evangelize and established mission stations in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Geographically, the entry reflects all the areas where Methodist Church in Zimbabwe operate across the spectrum of Zimbabwe and beyond. Methodism in Zimbabwe as shall be noted in the entry operate under the leadership of a Presiding Bishop who is in charge of the whole Zimbabwean Conference. The Zimbabwean Conference constitute eight districts namely: Bulawayo district, Hwange district, Gweru district, Masvingo district, Kadoma district, Marondera district, Harare West district and Harare East district. These districts are under the supervision of a District Bishop who has the responsibility to pastor the district and have an oversight to the whole district. The incumbents are to occupy these positions for a period of 5 years and they go back to the trenches. The succession plan helps the church to be strong and avoid divisions because of the structures that serve the interest of the church at the expense of an individual.

1742,Yellow Flower Hill (Huanghuagang) 72 Martyrs' Cemetery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"On April 27, 1911 (the twenty-ninth day of the third month according to the lunar calendar), a few Guangzhou residents were aroused before dawn. A group of local gentry, businessmen, overseas students, and secret society members armed with pistols and explosives smuggled from Hong Kong broke into the residence of the Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi, Zhang Mingqi (1875–1945). Some leaders of the insurgence had joined the Revolutionary Alliance founded by Sun Yat-sen in Japan in 1905. The skirmish lasted for just a day because the plot had already been leaked to the authorities. The revolt leaders were expecting the reinforcements led by Zhao Sheng (1881–1911) and Hu Hanmin (1879–1936) to join them, but they did not materialize. Many of the rebels were killed in battle. The Qing authorities captured and executed a number of others immediately afterwards. The body count was recorded at 86, but only 72 of the bodies could be identified. These 72 men became to be known as the Yellow Flower Hill martyrs. The site, with its simple graves, became the Yellow Flower Hill where a memorial complex was first constructed in the late 1910s. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Guangdong leadership renovated the tomb multiple times, adding new decorative structures and expanding the gravesite into an impressive monument that adorned the regionally circulated currency.  The magnificent structure was built with marble, bricks, and stone, and adorned with eclectic elements, all of which marked a departure from features of traditional shrines. On the very top is the Statue of Liberty (Goddess of Liberty 自由女神) holding a book and a mallet, in honor of those who fought for Han Chinese people’s freedom from the Manchu rulers. The statue was installed on top of a brick wall. The top of the main monument was adorned with decorative bricks inscribed with names of overseas Nationalist branches, which donated to the construction. The commemorative structure was used in regional coins in the 1920s and 1930s. Scattered through the complex were incense burner columns with Buddhist swastikas, iron-cast skulls as capitals, and the Nationalist Party blue-sky white-sun emblem. The site is a significant example of the cult of the dead in modern and contemporary China.",1911,2023,1948,1435,Linh Vu,2023-05-04 07:58:09.380 +0200,2024-02-11 05:34:15.373 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1743,Eight Treasures Mountain (Babaoshan) Revolutionary Cemetery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"In 1950, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) began transforming the Eight Treasures Mountain (Babaoshan) into a national cemetery for its most esteemed members and supporters. Although the PRC erases the imperial and republican past, it follows its predecessors in shaping national memory by creating a sacred site for the loyal dead. Furthermore, despite atheist self-proclamation, the PRC relies on traditional beliefs and practices to memorialize its highest-ranking cadres and most devoted supporters. The state’s attempts to shape national memory have not been without resistance from the bereaved families of those who died in controversial pasts. The PRC in the twenty-first century, turns to information technology and eco-burial methods to manage the growing population of the dead and to meet consumerist demands of its living population. 

When the CCP leaders removed all remnants of the imperial eunuchs from the Eight Treasures Mountain, they thought the land was sufficiently purified to hold the ashes of their most esteemed members. But the ghosts came later in the political mayhem of the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square crackdown, both of which shook the foundation of the Party and continue to rumble beneath the surface. Despite the state’s efforts to control the narrative of history by dictating who can (and who must) reside in the deified Revolutionary Cemetery, the living persist in fighting for the memories of the dead.",1950,2024,1949,1435,Linh Vu,2023-05-04 08:30:13.728 +0200,2024-01-11 17:54:20.619 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1746,"Church of St. Constantine and Helena, Avdou",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of St. Constantine and Helena is located west of the village of Avdou alongside the dam of Aposelemis (completed in 2012). The church, today enclosed by a rubble wall, is slightly elevated above the surrounding olive groves. The hills of the Lassithi plateau are visible to the south of the church.
The single nave church, today whitewashed, has a saddle roof exterior and a pointed vault interior. The entrance is framed within a pointed arch with a carved lintel, showing a quatrefoil rosette enclosed by a wreath. The remnants of the image of St. Constantine are still visible in the niche above the lintel. Just below the gable roof are five round indentations suggesting that at some point glazed bowls were immured into the facade of the church.
Inside the church, a transverse arch divides the nave into two bays. The wall paintings, although damaged, are still legible. The dome of the sanctuary apse shows Christ Pantocrator above two co-officiating bishops, St. John Chrysostom and St. Basil. Although heavily damaged, it is possible that they flank the Melismos in the center. The triumphal arch surrounding the stone altar shows the Hospitality of Abraham on the upper register followed by the Annunciation in the center register. The deacons, St. Stephen and St. Phanourios flank the apse. In the sanctuary vault, the scenes of the Ascension and the Pentecost are presented on the north and south sides respectively. The Gallery of Saints along the side walls include the images of St. Romanus the Melodist, St. Nicholas, St. Anthony (whose face is damaged), St. Marina and Saints Constantine and Helena. Additional saints, unidentifiable, are presented as busts along the transverse arch.
The nave vault includes scenes from both the Christological Cycle and the lives of the titular saints, Saints Constantine and Helena. These scenes include the Finding of the True Cross, the Elevation of the True Cross and, possibly, the Baptism of Constantine. The Christological cycle, although reduced, includes scenes of the Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Anastasis and the Healing of the Blind (an unusual addition considering the reduced cycle presented). 
The west wall includes the Dormition of the Virgin on the upper part of the wall above the door. The lower register of the west wall, to the left side of the entrance is the standing figure of the Archangel Gabriel, his face completely damaged. To the right of the entrance there is a partially preserved dedicatory inscription which notes that the church was built by the contribution and efforts of the priest Manuel during the reign of John (VIII) Palaiologos (1425-48) on 2 September 6954 (1445) by the hand of Manuel and Ioannis Phokas.
Below the dedicatory inscription, albeit in poor condition, are two frames of individual sinners and one frame of Communal Punishments (so heavily damaged that all that can be observed is the red background). Among the individual sinners are both male and female fornicators, snakes coiling around their bodies and biting their genitals, the Thief (of which only his legs survive), and the Sorcerer.
The inclusion of St. Phanourios, unusually depicted as a deacon, is indicative of the spread of his cult on the island of Crete during the fifteenth century. Additionally, the quality of the work reflects the art of the major artistic centers of the Byzantine world, especially important considering the proximity of this church to the main capital of the island, Candia (today Heraklion).",1445,2023,1952,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-05-05 21:47:12.616 +0200,2023-05-17 18:51:02.868 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1750,The London-Leiden Magical Papyrus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The ""London-Leiden Magical Papyrus"" (PMagLL) is an ancient Egyptian ritual manual and the most extensive magical papyrus known to us today, not only in terms of its physical dimensions, but also regarding the number of preserved ritual instructions.

The scroll measures approximately 500 cm x 34 cm and was inscribed on both sides with 1,254 lines: 1,227 in Demotic and another 27 in Greek. 62 columns are preserved, 29 on the recto and 33 on the verso.

The content comprises 98 individual sections, mostly ritual instructions, supplemented by information about herbs and minerals used in ritual practice as well as alternative invocations. The ritual instructions are focused on divination and erotica, and to a lesser extent on curses and magico-medical prescriptions. 

The Demotic text was supplemented by numerous Greek glosses throughout the manuscript and these glosses played a major role in the decipherment of Demotic.

The scribe of PMagLL used a cipher to encrypt predominantly ritual ingredients and in some cases the effects of rituals when those were especially harmful. In addition, a separate monoalphabetic substitution key is written in a 90° angle at the beginning of the verso.

The exact findspot of the scroll is unknown. It was 
purchased by Giovanni D'Anastasy (so spelled in letters he wrote but in some publications also written ""Anastasi"") in the early 19th century in Egypt, likely in Thebes. Between 1828 and 1857 D'Anastasy was the Swedish-Norwegian Consul in Egypt. In addition, he carried on a large trade in antiquities, buying over 8,000 papyri and artefacts directly from the inhabitants of Saqqara and Thebes and selling a vast number of those to European museums, among them the London-Leiden Magical Papyrus. 

D'Anastasy seems to have purchased the papyrus in two pieces, potentially even at different times and being unaware of the fact that they belonged together, since he sold one part to the Dutch government in 1828 while the other part was bought for the British Museum in London at an auction in Paris in 1857.

It took until the late 19th century before scholars had noticed that the two parts constitute a single manuscript. Up until today the beginning of the ritual manual remains at the British Museum under the inventory number EA10070 while the second part is kept at the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden (Netherlands) under the museum number AMS 65 (previously I 383, in older publications J 383).

The dating of PMagLL is debated and ranges from the late 2nd to the early 3rd century. 

In academic publications the papyrus is referred to as „pdm xiv“ and „PGM XIV“ which stands for ""papyri demoticae magicae"" (Demotic magical papyri) and ""papyri graecae magicae"" (Greek magical papyri).",180,225,1955,1392,Kirsten Dzwiza,2023-05-09 02:20:50.172 +0200,2023-05-17 17:54:46.821 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1751,The holy Kjeld of Viborg (older text),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The holy Kjeld of Viborg was a Danish clergyman from the 12th C. who was canonized and revered as a saint until the Danish reformation. Although he was venerated across medieval Denmark, primarily, there are signs from the middle ages that his cult also did spread into Norway, Sweden, and Northern Germany at least to some extent. In Norway his feast day has been found included in a late medieval calendar. In Northern Germany information on him has been found in at least one religious book. In Sweden, no less than 4 fragmentary liturgical manuscripts from the middle ages has been found with his cult included in them. Although one of these 4 manuscripts might be somewhat explained because it was found on Gotland, and this island was under Danish rule during the later middle ages, none of the other three manuscripts can necessarily be explained that easily. Thus although his saint´s cult does not seem to have been venerated systematically across dioceses outside of Denmark, it does seem like his cult must have been known and perhaps even celebrated to some extent also in the areas neighbouring Denmark. At least this seems to have been the case within certain groups or regions, although probably not systematically all over. Possibly his cult spread because it gained a certain regional popularity in parts of the monastic world. Kjeld himself was a member of the holy chapter in Viborg diocese in Denmark and at his time that holy chapter was also an augustinian convent. No less than two of the four medieval manuscripts found in Sweden has monastic origins, as one them stems from the Bridgettines at Vadstena monastery and the other one seems to have roots within the Franciscan Order. 
According to sources St. Kjeld was born in Jutland probably quite early on during the reign of king Niels of Denmark (1104-34), and he died on 27. September 1150. He was of noble descent and his career as a clergyman was spent at the holy chapter in Viborg diocese in Denmark, where he became a cathedral canon. It also seems like he probably received some kind of formal education himself and later as canon he seems to have led the cathedral school in Viborg for a while. He ended his career at the chapter as elected dean. Later on Viborg always remained the essential center of his saint´s cult. He was canonized presumably on 11. july in either 1188 or 1189 by archbishop Absalon of Lund in Denmark after Absalon had achieved papal consent and permission to let Kjeld´s sanctity be examined and canonize him if this was deemed justified. 
The preserved text about St. Kjeld was probably written around 1187 or 1188 to coincide with his canonization process. The actual biography is followed by a list of miracles which seems to be more or less contemporary with the biographical text, as many of the miracles seem to have happened during the period from 1185 to 1187 when judging from the dates mentioned. Although the original, complete version of the text has now been lost, comprehensive excerpts are preserved. The anonymous author must have been a well educated clergyman who knew Kjeld personally, and he seems to have been a cathedral canon at the holy chapter in Viborg just like Kjeld himself had been earlier on.
The text starts out by telling about his childhood, youth, and education, then continuing on with his clerical career in Viborg, the murder of bishop Eskil, his mentor, and the election of Kjeld as a dean. It goes on from there with his accomplishments during a city fire in Viborg, as a mediator during a civil war in Denmark, and his captivity with heathens. It also tells about how his generosity towards the poor was so great that he became exiled from the holy chapter for a while until being reinstated by the Pope in Rome. It concludes by telling about his death and the subsequent miracles which followed.",1188,1536,1956,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-05-09 08:55:03.049 +0200,2023-06-05 09:25:18.195 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1753,"Church of St. George, Sklavopoula",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of St. George in the village of Sklavopoula (Selino) is a single nave church with a modern belfry and a restored roof. Located just outside the main area of the village, the church is dated to 6799 Indiction 4 (1290-91) based on an inscription in the middle of the half cylinder of the apse. The eastern section (including the apse, the gallery of saints on the north wall inside the sanctuary, the busts of saints and the image of the Archangel Michael in the naos immediately outside the modern wooden iconostasis) were painted by Nikolaos, named in the inscription. The remainder of the church was painted by an unknown artist. Based on stylistic analysis and the location of the inscription, it is possible that the workshop of Nikolaos also worked at the Church of St. George in the village of Vathi in Kissamos (dated to 1283-84).
The exterior of the church includes two buttresses on the north wall and one on the southern wall with two entrances to the church, the main portal on the west side and a modern door on the southern side. An elongated niche above the west entrance includes a small square window. The south side of the church and the roof has been reconstructed and no wall paintings remain.
The sanctuary is decorated in with the Virgin Platytera in the half dome of the apse with the Mandylion in the triumphal arch above flanked by the portraits of Joachim and St. Anne with the Annunciation presented below. The lowest register of the apse is decorated with four co-officiating bishops who flank the main inscription presented on a rectangle framed in a red border. The north wall of the sanctuary includes the standing figures of two bishops below the busts of two bishop saints.
The north side continues outside of the modern iconostasis with three niches which include, from east to west: the Archangel Michael, St. George on horseback and St. Theodore Stratelates, also on horseback, with an elaborate shield incorporating pseudo-kufic on his left side. A badly damaged female saint is depicted standing between the Archangel Michael while St. Demetrios stands between St. George and St. Theodore a similarly ornate shield decorated with a checkerboard pattern on his back.
Above the image of the Archangel Michael are three niches showing an unidentified bishop, a monastic saint and, divided by a decorative panel, another unidentified male saint. Above the images of the three military saints are scenes from the life of the titular saint, St. George, including St. George in the Cauldron (above St. Theodore) and St. George on the Wheel (Above the image of St. George). The remainder of the vault wall paintings have been lost.
The western wall, around the main door is badly damaged but depicts the Crucifixion above the door against a dark blue background. To either side of the door below the Crucifixion are the remains of three busts of saints, two, a male and a female saint, are preserved to the left of the entrance and the head of another saint is preserved on the right. Another standing saint, heavily damaged, can be discerned to the left of the entrance.",1290,2023,1958,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-05-11 01:13:21.443 +0200,2023-05-23 19:17:31.577 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1754,Đại Bảo Tháp Mandala Tây Thiên (Great Mandala Stupa),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Đại Bảo Tháp Mandala Tây Thiên is situated inside the Tam Đảo National Park and is part of the larger Tây Thiên spiritual tourism complex, which attracts Hanoians looking for a mountainous spiritual retreat. It houses relics, scriptures and is the central headquarters for Drukpa Vietnam. It is arguably the most widely recognizable Vajrayana temple in Vietnam and Gyalwang Drukpa’s visits attract national media coverage. While this entry focuses on Drukpa Vietnam and its main temple, the Great Mandala Stupa, it should be noted that cultural/religious influence is moving both directions between Vietnam and India. For example, Gyalwang Drukpa found out circa 2008 about Vietnamese nuns who practice martial arts. Since then, he has encouraged over 800 nuns across the Himalayas to practice ‘kung-fu’ and to become chant masters, a role traditionally played only by men. In total, Gyalwang Drukpa has visited Vietnam 12 times. In 2014, he completed a 10-hour service for the departed souls of natural disasters (attended by over 1,000 people). In 2018, he presided over the completion of the massive sand mandala, dedicated to the Bodhisattva Guanyin, which remains housed on the premise. His first visit to Vietnam after the pandemic subsided was in 2023, when he hosted the 3-day Avalokiteshvara Festival at the Great Mandala Stupa, which was live streamed and attended by thousands. One of the main events (besides Gyalwang Drukpa’s birthday celebration) was the unfurling of the 12x16 meter Avalokiteshvara Thongdrol (‘liberation through seeing’) brocade painting, donated in 2017, which is recognized as a world record. The fusion of Vajrayana, spiritual tourism and world records in Vietnam is a feature shared with the 2023 Samten Hills resort.",2011,2023,1959,576,Stephen Christopher,2023-05-11 17:10:04.380 +0200,2023-12-05 13:14:02.850 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1758,Jiuge 九歌,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Jiuge 九歌 (Nine Songs) is a collection of eleven songs, transmitted as a section of the Chu 楚 poetry collection entitled Chuci 楚辭 (Songs of Chu). It was the Eastern Han 東漢 (25 CE – 220 CE) poet and librarian Wang Yi 王逸 (fl. 130–140 CE) who edited the first Chuci anthology with a commentary, the Chuci zhangju 楚辭章句. A large amount of poems in the collection was attributed to the 4th century BCE Chu state official and poet Qu Yuan 屈原 (340–278 BCE). Both Wang Yi and Liu Xiang 劉向 (79 CE - 8 CE) consider Qu Yuan to be the author of the Jiuge, yet modern scholarship agrees that is highly improbable that he wrote all the songs. Wang Yi, in particular, was the first one to associate this collection to Qu Yuan’s name: he believed that the poet wrote the eleven songs after having been banished and having heard rural religious hymns from the south, with the aim of improving their style. His hypothesis has been abandoned in favor of an understanding of the collection as originally meant to be performed at the royal court. Hawkes attributes the Jiuge to one or more poets active at the Chu court in the late Chu capital Shouchun 壽春 (241-223 BCE).
The collection mostly consists of shamanic hymns, with the exception of one elegy for fallen soldiers, and a finale, the only two songs which are not dedicated to a god. 
The titles of the eleven poems are as follows: Donghuang Taiyi 東皇太一 (Taiyi Ruler of the East); Yunzhong jun 雲中君 (The lord within the clouds); Xiang jun 湘君 (The lord of the Xiang river); Xiang furen 湘夫人 (The lady of the Xiang river); Da siming 大司命 (The greater minister of fate); Shao siming 少司命 (The lesser minister of fate); Dong jun 東君 (The lord of the east); Hebo 河伯 (The earl of the river); Shan gui 山鬼 (The mountain spirit); Guo shang 國殤 (The fallen for the state); Li hun 禮魂 (Honoring the souls).
It is not known for sure whether the songs included in the collection were originally nine or eleven. Galal Walker attempted to prove that the last two songs, the “Guo shang” and the “Li Hun” have been added at a later time. Yet, various scholars attempted to justify the existence of eleven poems in the collection, instead of nine. For example, the Qing 清 (1636–1912 C.E.) scholar Jiang Ji’s 蔣驥 (ca. 1678–1745) theory according to which the “Xiang jun” and “Xiang furen” need to be considered as one piece, as well as the “Da siming” and “Shao siming.” The Ming scholar Wang Fuzhi 王夫之 (1619–1692), on the contrary, proposed to read the first and last songs as a prelude and a finale, leaving them out from the count of the nine songs. One other possible explanation is that the title has been chosen to recall the “Nine Songs” from mythological tradition, that appear in texts such as the Shanhai jing 山海經 (Classic of the Mountains and the Seas) and the Da Yumo 大禹謨 chapter of the Shujing 書經 (Classic of Documents). 
The nine shamanic elegies typically consist of two halves: the first section describes the preparation and the journey in search of a god; the second section usually expresses dismay at the departure of the god or at the fact that the god did not make himself manifest. Some of the songs detail the music, clothing, food, and drink offerings peculiar to the various rituals of invocation of the god. And when the god, usually described with anthropomorphic features, shows up, the relationship he establishes with the shamaness or shaman is of a loving and erotic type.
This collection represents a key source of information on shamanic practices in the southern state of Chu, providing us with the names of the worshipped deities, as well as other details on the ritual practices. 
Unfortunately, we do not have precise information on how these songs were to be performed. As far as it emerges from the texts, the performers of these songs were to be shamans (those able to summon a deity to possess them), dressed in colorful robes and adorned with various kinds of jewelry, and the execution was to be backed by musical accompaniment of various instruments, wind, string, and percussion.",-340,140,1272,1195,Francesca Puglia,2023-05-17 14:40:57.147 +0200,2023-06-02 19:59:25.766 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1760,Sanctuary of Hera in the Argolid,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Sanctuary of Hera in the Argolid contains archaeological material dating to the Late Bronze Age and was likely a Mycenaean cult area. In the Archaic Period, the temenos and sanctuary were expanded and a wooden temple of Hera was constructed. In the 7th through 5th centuries, the city-states of Mycenae, Tiryns, and Argos co-managed the sanctuary. In the 460s BCE Argos achieved mastery over the sanctuary after destroying Mycenae and Tiryns, and by the middle of the 5th century BCE the sanctuary entered into a new phase of construction and monumentalization. From this time on, the sanctuary came to represent the worldview of Argos and its festival of Hera achieved broad renown. The sanctuary experienced a devastating fire that destroyed the Archaic Temple, but a replacement temple was already in the works and completed no later than the 390s BCE. This temple was still standing when the Roman-era Greek traveler Pausanias visited the site in the middle of the 2nd century CE. The sanctuary probably fell out of use sometime after the sack of the Visigoths at the end of the 4th century CE.",-800,400,1963,1370,John Haberstroh,2023-05-23 21:11:00.403 +0200,2023-05-23 21:11:00.403 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1761,Paganism in the 4th Century Nicomedia,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Nicomedia's aspect and well-being can be compared to an ideal city model in some ways.  Originally, the city was built around Greek and Roman idols. Dionysus and Hercules were credited with building the city, and Zeus was tasked with protecting it. As time went on, the idolatry continued. A pagan Nicomedia can be seen, for example, in the second century AD. In Nicomedia, the pagan element was generally accepted, but it did not bring universal harmony. During the same period (2nd century), the first Christians began to appear in Bithynia. Christianity was seen as blasphemous to the Roman Empire and society at the time, as well as a presence associated with witchcraft; such practices threatened the rule of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, the presence of the pagans was still bold. Nicomedia had still impressive temples and statues dedicated to the ancient gods and sacrificial altars. Nicomedia experienced a transitional period in regard to social worship in the fourth century: the beginning of the rise of Christianity and the downfall of paganism.",300,400,1177,1337,Zoe Tsiami,2023-05-24 15:06:57.696 +0200,2023-07-25 14:54:58.904 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1762,Quan Âm Tu Viện,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Quan Âm Tu Viện is located in the residential area of Phú Nhuận district in Hồ Chí Minh City. Dating back to the 1960s, the monastery land was originally a water-logged islet accessible only by boat. Now bridges cross the Nhiêu Lộc – Thị Nghè Canal, which makes it more convenient to access the monastery. As the name suggests, it is primarily dedicated to the worship of the compassion Bodhisattva, Avalokitesvara, called Quan Âm in Vietnamese. In contrast to Vajrayana where Avalokitesvara is depicted in male form, he is represented as female in Vietnamese Mahayana. Quan Âm Tu Viện epitomizes syncretism between Vietnamese Mahayana and Vajrayana aesthetics, rituals and teachings. Prior to 2010, the monastery was purely Mahayana with only one main hall located on the second floor of the main structure. After becoming allied with Gyalwang Drukpa, the reincarnate spiritual leader of the Drukpa lineage, founded by Naropa over 1,000 years ago, the temple began hybridizing, turning the lecture hall on the ground floor into a second main hall dedicated to Vajrayana deities. The monastery is known for its connection with the Drukpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, its prominent abbot (who is allied with the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha, or VBS) and its notable followers, which include top entrepreneurs, government officials and cultural influencers. There are two groups that share occupancy: the Mahayana Great Compassion group and an unnamed Vajrayana group that is composed of primarily young and cosmopolitan followers and meets whenever Tibetans are in residence. Gyalwang Drukpa and his sangha visit the temple once a year around Tết Nguyên Đán (Vietnamese Lunar New Year) and attract thousands of people and national media coverage. He first visited Vietnam in 2007 and has been coming back regularly ever since, marking his 12th time returning in 2023. The Drukpa sangha is hosted in Great Mandala Stupa in the north and Quan Âm Tu Viện in the south. Quan Âm Tu Viện, in association with its sister temple in the nearby province of Bình Phước, which is a purely Mahayana temple, often organize short-term retreats and teachings for lay people, especially for family and young children. Quan Âm Tu Viện is also known for running a traditional Vietnamese medical clinic called Tuệ Tĩnh Đường, which provides free healthcare services to disadvantaged people. In Hồ Chí Minh City, Quan Âm Tu Viện is commonly known for being one of the few Vajrayana temples, besides the nearby Chùa Lâm Huê.",1960,2023,1964,576,Stephen Christopher,2023-05-24 15:53:22.075 +0200,2023-11-07 20:52:34.580 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1763,Uḍḍīśatantra,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A widely published Sanskrit tantra on magic.  It can be grouped in the Uḍḍ corpus, a hybrid group of magical texts sharing the Uḍḍ-prefix in their titles, such as the Uḍḍāmeśvaratantra or Uḍḍāmaratantra.  Its title means the tantra of the leaping or bellowing lord.

Topics include sorcery, fantastic feats, enchanted objects, and conjuring, mostly of female creatures.  The ṣaṭkarmani include the following:

 1.	śānti-puṣṭi (tranquilizing-increase) 
2.	vaśīkaraṇa (subjugating) 
3.	stambhana (immobilizing) 
4.	mohana (bewildering)
5.	vidveṣana (dissent) 
6.	uccāṭana (eradicating) 
7.	ākarṣaṇa (attracting)
8.	mārana (murder)

They are expanded in detail for the majority of the text, but the source also contains ""meta-data"" that explain the reasons for variations in ritual actions and ingredients.  The metadata also nuances the results.  Such magic rituals reveal the social worlds and material cultures of the authors.  

The text closes with sections describing general rituals and enchanted objects that are not easily classified under the rubric of the six results.

Of note is that this text is spoke by Śiva to Rāvaṇa, the demon king of Lanka, famous adversary in the Rāmāyana.

The text is difficult to date, as are most of the tantras in the genre of magic ritual tantras.  There are many scattered manuscripts, but my instinct is that it is 1400s at the absolute earliest.

The text was likely composed in its earliest forms its earliest form in Eastern South Asia, but it was revered and spread throughout the Himalayas and Tibet.

The text opens with narrative opening in which Maheśvara  (Śiva) is dominated, killed, and revived, converted by Vajradhara.  After this Maheśvara is considered a protector of Buddhism.  Maheśvara is also considered the lord or the supernatural hordes.  And sequences of supernatural beings, mostly female are the main concern of this text.

Multiple sādhanas conjure female deities that covert with yogīs, granting them incredible riches and powers.  Included are Yakṣinīs, Bhūtiṇī, Nāginīs, and more.  The standard ritual describes eight to twelve spirit goddesses, then specific offering, rituals, and mantras for each.  If the ritual is successful, the goddesses come forward to bless the practitioner and grant wealth, magical powers, sovereignty, divine maidens.  The practitioner sometimes copulates with the spirit goddesses.

The source closes with a vague discussion of the different emptinesses.

1773,"Church of St. George and St. Nicholas, Anydri",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The double church of St. George and St. Nicholas, located in the village of Anydri, overlooks both the mountainous landscape of southern Crete and the sea beyond. Located at the top of the Anydri Gorge, the village is connected to the coast via a 3km trail.
Dating to 1323, the church of St. George, the original structure on the site, was painted by Ioannis Pagomenos. A single nave barrel vaulted construction, the church of St. George includes a high central transept which draws the eye upwards as one reaches the center of the nave. This architectural type is unusual in Crete. By contrast, the connected church of St. Nicholas, dated by stylistic analysis to the middle of the fourteenth century, is a barrel-vaulted structure that was later extended to the west. Three archways, two in the nave and one in the sanctuary, connect the northern wall of the church of St. Nicholas to the southern wall of the church of St. George. Each sanctuary is separated from the nave by a modern wooden iconostasis.
In the church of St. George, the apse of the sanctuary includes an image of the Deesis where the figure of St. George takes the place of St. John the Baptist. The lower register of the apse includes four co-officiating bishops flanking the Melismos. As traditional, the Hospitality of Abraham and the Annunciation are presented on the triumphal arch around the main altar. The northern wall of the sanctuary includes a niche decorated with Saints Polycarpus and John Eleëmon with the image of St. Stephen to the right of the niche. The southern niche of the sanctuary was removed to create the archway leading to the church of St. Nicholas. From this only the image of St. Romanus remains. Outside the sanctuary, the transept vault includes scenes from the Christological cycle including the Raising of Lazarus and the Presentation of the Temple. Much of the southern wall has been lost due to the opening of the second archway, however, the northern wall includes a large figure of St. George on horseback killing the dragon.
Scenes from the life of St. George, including his martyrdom on the wheel, fill the vault of the western part of the church. Below these scenes on the northern wall is a large image of St. Demetrios on horseback. He is flanked by the images of St. Marina and St. Anastasia. As the southern wall was damaged by the archway leading to the church of St. Nicholas, only the images of St. Sophia and another unidentified female saint remain. Likewise, the western wall only preserves the images of St. Kyriaki, to the left of the entrance, and St. Paraskevi, to the right. The dedicatory inscription, located above the image of St. Sophia and giving the date of 10 May 6831 (1323), indicates that almost everyone in the village contributed to the creation of this church. 
The Church of St. Nicholas can be tentatively dated to the middle of the fourteenth century based on stylistic analysis of the remaining paintings of which most are in a poor state of preservation. The apse is decorated with an image of St. Nicholas flanked by Christ and the Virgin while the southern wall of the sanctuary includes images of St. John Chrysostom and St. Cyril of Crete. The barrel vault is also badly damaged but the scene of the Ascension along with a handful of scenes from the life of St. Nicholas can be identified. The nave of the church includes scenes from the Last Judgment including the Apostle Tribunal, a Choir of Saints, and a Choir of Apostles. Nothing else remains of the paintings on the northern or western walls of the church.",1323,2023,1966,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-05-25 00:05:05.552 +0200,2023-05-25 00:05:05.552 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Historical records, namely the Complete Book of the Historical Records of Đại Việt written by Ngô Sĩ Liên, stated that the temple was built by King Lý Thái Tổ in 1010, along with other seven temples, after the king moved the capital of Đại Việt (Vietnam) from Hoa Lư to Thăng Long (Hanoi). The name “Thắng Nghiêm” was derived from the king’s first impression of the land being “trang nghiêm thù thắng” or a “extraordinarily dignified.”  The temple is famous for having multiple prominent historical figures in residence, and one of which is the Grand Prince Hưng Đạo of the Trần Dynasty (1225-1400). Thắng Nghiêm expresses a hybrid of traditional Lý Dynasty Mahayana, Tibetan Buddhism (Drukpa Kagyud) and the indigenized Mikkyō (Đông Mật) that made up the lineage of Hương tích chính tông. In resemblance with the distinctive features of Vietnam’s northern temples, Thắng Nghiêm is home to both Buddhism and Đạo Mẫu (the worship of Mother Goddess). During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), the temple was largely destroyed during multiple bombings, and then the communist revolutionary government took over and repurposed it as a refugee camp with temporary classrooms for young students. A majority of temple land was either given or lent to people for resettlement after the war. In 1991, the temple was recognized as a national historical site and put under the administrative management of the People’s Committee of Thanh Oai District. In 1995, the abbot donated the temple to the High Venerable Thích Viên Thành, the 11th Head of Hương tích chính tông and abbot of Chùa Hương. The High Venerable appointed his student, Thích Minh Thanh, to take on the abbotship on his behalf. Since 1997, abbot Thích Minh Thanh has been attempting to reclaim the land. The massive reconstruction of the temple began in 2010, but it was not until 2017 that it started to draw the attention of Hanoi city authorities, which resulted in a formal investigation and public backlash. The main criticism was that the architecture aesthetics is extravagant with gold-plated Tibetan-style statues and does not represent traditional Vietnamese temple style.

1782,"Church of the Panagia, Prodromi",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Located outside of the village of Prodromi in the southwest province of Selino on the island of Crete, the Church of the Panagia is a single nave chapel covered with a barrel vault on the interior and a saddle roof exterior. Located just up a dirt track from the main road leading from Anydri to Temenia, the church overlooks the low brush of the surrounding hillsides leading down to the coast visible in the distance.
Today whitewashed, the church has one entrance on the west side. The interior of the church is divided into two bays by a transverse arch. Each bay includes two niches on the north and south walls of which the eastern niches are divided today by a modern wooden iconostasis. The half dome of the apse is decorated with the Virgin Platytera. The lower register includes four co-officiating bishops flanking a small window. Unusually, the triumphal arch of the sanctuary includes the image of the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple above the image of the Annunciation. The deacons St. Stephen and St. Romanus the Melodist flank the apse. 
Of the two niches of the sanctuary area, only the northern is well preserved and shows the Virgin Dexiokratousa. The vault of the sanctuary shows the Ascension along with scenes from the life of the Virgin including the Prayer of St. Anne and the Annunciation to Joachim. The transverse arch dividing the sanctuary from the nave includes standing images of the prophets David, Solomon, Daniel and Isaiah. The lower register of the transverse arch is decorated with the Archangel Michael on the north and the Archangel Gabriel on the south. 
The vault of the nave is decorated, on the southern side, with scenes from the Christological cycle and, on the northern side, with images from the life of the Virgin. Below the scenes of the life of the Virgin is the image of the Death of the Virgin located in the niche of the northern wall. In this image, the Virgin, shown lying on an intricate burgundy cloth decorated with birds, is surrounded by mourners whose gestures and expressions add a weight and emotion to the scene. By contrast, the southern niche includes the images of Saint George and St. Demetrios on horseback. Their horses, one brown and one black, intertwine their necks in the center of the scene. 
The western wall includes an image of the Crucifixion above the entrance. Below the Crucifixion the dedicatory inscription runs across the entirety of the wall noting that the Church of the Virgin Skaphidiani (of Skaphidia, a toponym) was built by several families of the surrounding communities (they are named individually) and painted by Iokim on 7 April 6855 (1347).

1783,The holy Kjeld of Viborg (younger text),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The holy Kjeld was a dean from Viborg diocese. He died on 27. September 1150 and with papal permission he was later canonized by archbishop Absalon of Denmark in 1188. Two hagiographic texts are known about the holy Kjeld of Viborg, an older one and a younger one, although the younger one has gone widely unnoticed and very little has been written about it. A main reason that it has been largely forgotten is probably the fact that it was left out of both primary source editions of Danish medieval hagiography, as neither M. Cl. Gertz (Vitae Sanctorum Danorum) nor Hans Olrik (Danske Helgeners Levned) included it in their books. As to why these choices were made, one can only speculate. It may have been simply overlooked, but more likely it may have been a conscious choice made because of doubt related to its actual age and origin. At their time, this source had been published only in a somewhat obsolete latin edition from the 1700s. Shortly after their time, however, a posthumous article by a young Danish historian, Thomas B. Bang, who had by then already died from the Spanish flu, shed some much needed new light on the younger text when he republished the source in a Danish local historical journal. His new source edition differed from the older edition in two ways primarily. First of all, he published it in Danish. This actually seems to have been the language that the source had been written in originally, but Jacob Langebek who had published it in the 1700s had made the odd choice of translating it from Danish into latin before he published it. Just as importantly, Bang also succeeded in shedding some much needed new light on the source. What the article by Thomas B. Bang did not succeed in doing, though, was making the source known to a larger audience. As it had by now already been left out of the books by Gertz and Olrik and the new article by Thomas B. Bang also went largely unnoticed, fact still is that only very little has been written about this text since Bang´s time. It was mentioned (although not republished) in a later source edition of the older texts about St. Kjeld by Henning Høirup and O.F. Stjernfeldt, but apart from that, this appears to be the very first article about the younger text since Thomas B. Bang´s time.
 The older text on St. Kjeld and the younger text about St. Kjeld, respectively, are quite different not only in dating and in their individual background of creation, but also stylistically. The younger text about the holy Kjeld of Viborg does not the follow the normal somewhat stricter structure of hagiography, but is instead a structurally loose collection of information of his life and kin put together with miracle stories also connected to Kjeld´s own lifetime. Structurally the text thus bears much more resemblance to the younger text about the holy Niels than it does to the older and structurally stricter generations of Danish hagiography. Together with the text about the holy Anders and also with the younger text about the holy Niels, this younger text about the holy Kjeld paints the picture of an existing, although previously unnoticed, younger generation of late medieval Danish hagiography which differed from the older generation of Danish hagiography by being much more loose structurally. While the older generations of Danish hagiography can be viewed as being hagiography in the much more classic sense of the term, this younger generation of Danish hagiography from the late medieval period perhaps were not hagiography in the stricter sense of that term as much as they were simply loose collections of material gathered on the saint in question. This younger generation of Danish hagiography also differed from the older generation of Danish hagiographical texts in another way. While the older generations of texts generally put much weight on documentation by talking to eye witnesses etc., the younger generation of texts did not have that opportunity as all eye witnesses were by now dead long ago. Thus instead they relied on stories and information circulating orally not only amongst the people, but also amongst the clerics themselves in the milieu where it was written down. The texts also gathered written information where they could (as with the now lost book in Danish referred to by the younger Niels text), and they then mixed it all together into a miscellaneous collection of material on the saint in question. Just like the younger text about the holy Niels, the younger text about St. Kjeld is thus not a classic hagiographic text as much as it is a composite collection of anecdotes and miracle stories deemed worthy of remembrance by the author.
 Reviewing the text more closely than has been done in the past, it becomes clear that the text published by Bang actually differs slightly from the text that Langebek translated into latin and published in the 1700s. This can be proven easiest by mentioning a few examples of this (amongst more such differences of detail): The Langebek version mentions the later burial in the cathedral of the Danish king Svend III Grathe (murdered 1157). The Bang edition omits this completely, but includes instead a faulty late medieval tradition that Kjeld had been elected bishop of Viborg (cf. below). The two texts both mention Kjeld´s father, but by two different first names. Langebek and Bang therefore must have used different manuscript versions of the text, although the two manuscript versions must have been closely related and stemming from the same overall textual tradition. Possibly both manuscripts consists of partial copies and extract from a larger, now lost medieval manuscript. This, however, would not necessarily explain the different first name by which Kjeld´s father is referred to in the two editions. Thus another perhaps more likely possibility is that there may have existed more than one medieval manuscript version of this text and that the Langebek edition and the Bang edition, respectively, derives from different medieval manuscripts. 
A main reason that both Gertz and Olrik omitted the text from their books probably is that they doubted whether the text was actually medieval at all. As these two publishers knew only the Langebek edition, this is understandable. Langebek himself stated that he found the manuscript that he used amongst the papers of Henrik Gerner (bishop of Viborg 1693-1700), and this Langebek edition of the text remains extremely hazy on when the text was actually dated. The two manuscripts of the text that later Bang found and used for his article, however, contains a rather strange introduction text which sheds new light on the dating of the text and proves its medieval origins. This information was unbeknownst to Gertz and Olrik as the two manuscripts used by Bang had not yet been found when they published their books. The true nature of the strange introduction is revealed only when understood that it consists of notes written on more than one occassion by three generations of different owners and copyists.  The oldest generation of owner who made such a note was nobleman Tyge Krabbe (d. 1541) who luckily provides us with the year that he made his copy by saying that he made his copy in the year 1524. Naturally this means that the text must be older than that and thus it is now already proven that the text was really written in the middle ages.
The only question remaining thus is when exactly it was written.  The second generation of owner was Anne Krabbe, the daughter of Tyge Krabbe´s son. Her introductory note must have been written sometime around 1590, as she says in it (in Danish): ""this is written a hundred years ago at anno 1490"". Later on Høirup and Stjernfelt therefore referred to 1490 as the dating of the text, when they mentioned the text in their book. The question is whether this exact year can be trusted. On the one hand Anne Krabbe remains silent on where she had this piece of information from. Thus it could potentially be a simple guess on her behalf. On the other hand, being such an exact dating, 1490 seems a slightly strange year to simply invent out of the blue. Thus it could be suspected that she may have either seen that year in the lost medieval manuscript that was copied or at least either have heard or seen it referred to from that mansucript.  Moreover, although that exact year is impossible to prove, it agrees quite well with other overall circumstances: First of all, the note by Tyge Krabbe proved that the text was definitely written at least a number of years before 1524. As above, stylistically the text also fits rather well into the late medieval type of hagiographical texts that can be identified in Denmark. Thirdly, it is of importance that the Bang edition of the text includes a faulty late medieval tradition that Kjeld was elected bishop of Viborg even though it is known with certainty from contemporary sources (including the older hagiographical text about Kjeld) that this was actually never the case. This tradition that he was actually elected bishop seems to have arisen because later traditions had him confused with another Viborg bishop called Eskil. This confusion is understood when looking at two details from the older text about St. Kjeld. The first detail is the fact that the older text describes how Kjeld strived for martyrdom and wanted to travel to preach for the heathen people called the Vends, but apparently ended up simply returning home after meeting up with the Pope in Rome. The second detail regards the abovementioned bishop Eskil of Viborg. The older text describes how it was bishop Eskil of Viborg who ordained Kjeld as a priest, but also how this very same bishop Eskil was later murdered by enemies of Christ who attacked him at the altar in the middle of church service. This murder took place in 1132 in the still preserved Asmild monastery church during a civil war and was carried out by the men of king Erik II Emune of Denmark. The reason for the murder probably being that Eskil most likely supported the reigning king Niels who was Erik Emune´s enemy. These two details combined, Kjeld´s ambitions of martyrdom, and the murder of bishop Eskil were blended together later on and thus arose a confusing and faulty late medieval tradition that Kjeld was bishop of Viborg and a martyr saint. The faulty episcopal tradition of Kjeld seems to appear for the first time in a document from 1346 confirming the privileges of the holy chapter in Viborg. By around 1400 this faulty tradition apparently had Kjeld equipped with full-blown martyrdom as he is pictured  with a palm branch on the seal of Lage Glob, bishop of Viborg 1396-1429. This faulty tradition is confirmed also by other late medieval sources. Although not mentioning martyrdom, it must be this faulty late medieval episcopal tradition that the younger text derives from when it mentions that Kjeld was elected bishop. Conclusively, although 1490 remains unconfirmed as the exact year of dating of the younger text, it is probably quite likely as other circumstances prove that the text must have been written definitely before 1524 and likely after c. 1346.
 As for the text itself, the Langebek edition and the Bang edition both follow the same overall structure by starting out with describing both Kjeld himself, his accomplishments and also his family and then continuing on by telling the same two miracle stories from his lifetime. As above,  though, some of the details in terms of exact content differ somewhat when looking closely at the two text editions. The two miracle stories seem to have been based on oral stories circulating about Kjeld in late medieval Viborg and especially perhaps in the holy chapter there. What sources exactly that their more biographical introduction content was based on is harder to say. Question is whether this was also just based on oral traditions or whether this introductory part could have been partially based on written source material (just like the biographical content in the younger Niels text clearly was). The preserved source material, however, leave this question open for debate. Clearly, however, the miracle story with him reading the Bible in darkness echoes a passage within the older text on St. Kjeld.",1346,1524,1982,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-06-01 16:19:45.126 +0200,2023-06-05 09:28:59.186 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1784,The Cannibal Nun,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"'The Cannibal Nun' is a poem combining elements of narrative, lament, biography, and legal text, written by an jurist by the name of Andronikos with the title of Protediktos of the ecclesiastical court of Hagia Sophia sometime the twelfth century, and transmitted via the collection of Komnenian poetry in Marcianus Graecus 524. Utilizing the interrogative voice of the jurist and the constructed voice of the defendant in an composition reminiscent both of a threnos, or tragic lament, and a semeioma, a kind of court transcript, the author weaves a narrative of a provincial woman from the theme of Kyberrhaiotai, a nun called Maria, who resorted to consuming unclean animals and corpses (including that of her mother) and eventually killed and ate her child in desperation due to famine and the depredations of roving barbarians. Sometime later she was apparently prosecuted for her crime in the capital by the author of the composition. The poem is replete with classical and biblical references which attempt and fail to provide parallels to the behavior of the cannibal nun, including allusions to the respective filicides of Kronos, Tantalus, the Cyclopes, Medea, Agamemnon, Jephthah, and the Jewish woman in Josephus who killed her child, while also recording the defendants contention that she was compelled to her actions by hunger and privation, but nevertheless is willing to suffer her punishment, a sealing or branding of her mouth, in hopes of attaining salvation. Not only does this record an apparent cause-celebre which came before the Constantinopolitan ecclesiastical courts, but also something about the kinds of cases which these aforementioned courts might have tried in the twelfth-century, and the degree to which Byzantine views of ethics, history, and precedent were the products of a complicated symbiosis and dialogue between the culture of Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian Antiquity and the medieval present. Perhaps even more strikingly, the structure of the poem, framed as a litany of questions put forth by the jurist, a kind of poetic semeioma as he himself entitles it, perhaps may allow us a glimpse of the interrogatory procedures of the ecclesiastical court. Moreover, the case described in the poem draws attention to the degree that nuns were incorporated into the rural landscape and into traditional kinship networks, given that, for the author of the poem, there is nothing intrinsically strange about a presumably-widowed nun residing with her young child and her mother apparently in a domestic setting, an arrangement which recalls distinctly rural forms of domestic-monasticism.   In a wider intellectual context, this text reveals the effects which nascent Byzantine humanisms were having on notions of justice and humanity in Constantinople, allowing a literatus and ecclesiastical jurist such as Andronikos the Protediktos to utilize his classicizing learning as a way to understand, and, to a degree, empathize with, the motivations and needs of a provincial woman of no particular social standing.",1100,1200,1897,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-06-01 21:24:02.986 +0200,2023-06-27 19:06:49.397 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1785,Carmen de Incendio,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Carmen de Incendio is an extensive narrative poem composed in iambic verse by the Byzantine teacher, literatus, and deacon Konstantinos Stilbes, and transmitted via the manuscript Marcianus Graecus 524. It is an invaluable source for examining the worldview of a Byzantine ecclesiastical dignitary in the face of tragedy and urban crisis, and his sense of collective sin and potential collective redemption. It describes in an ekphrastic mode a disastrous fire ravaged Constantinople on July 25th, 1197, and the way it swept away houses, workshops, warehouses neighborhoods, churches, and whole swathes of the city along with their inhabitants, regardless of their station in life. As the poem relates, it was this fire which consumed the Church of the Theotokos Kyriotissa, which would be rebuilt between the fire and the Fourth Crusade in its current iteration, now known as the Kalenderhane Camii, a fact which allows the current structure to be dated. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the richly decorated churches of the city which, to the clerical Stilbes, represent the  most regrettable architectural losses from the fire and which occasion his most poignant lament upon the subject. Drawing upon a variety of classical and Biblical exempla to describe the fire, its human cost, and its deleterious effect on the urban fabric (an act which demonstrates the intellectual fertility of the Komnenian Age and the degree to which classicizing learning was a catalyst, rather than an impediment, to freedom of expression), Stilbes ultimately positions the fire as an instrument of God's judgement against a sinful population, comparing it to a cautery and the tears of the city's women to purifying waters, and expressing a hope that the contrition of the population will allow for a new beginning and a chance to rebuild. Yet, even so, such moral certainties are rendered ambiguous by his deeply trenchant descriptions of the innocent victims of the conflagration. The poignancy of his lament for a smoke-blackened Constantinople is rendered more acute by the way in which it anticipates the trauma and violation of the imperial capital during the Fourth Crusade and the literary responses to it. Moreover, it allows us an oblique view into the beliefs and sense of theodicy nurtured by a Byzantine ecclesiastical dignitary in the waning years of the twelfth-century.",1197,1197,1897,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-06-03 00:51:20.482 +0200,2023-06-27 20:07:19.891 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1786,Temple 2048 of Tell el-Mutesellum/Megiddo,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Temple 2048 was located in the north-eastern sector of the upper mound of Tell el-Mutesellim/Megiddo and it was excavated by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, under the direction of G. Loud during ‘30s and by the Tel Aviv University since 1992. This temple has been built in a area where it is testified the continued establishment of temples and sacred open areas since Early Bronze Age I, proving that the local population had assigned to this area a strong sacred value.
The architectural evolution of Temple 2048 has been divided into three phases by G. Loud (Strata VIII-VIIB-A), who dated the first two stages to Late Bronze Age II and the third one to Iron Age I. Although, successive studies and comparisons, especially with the Strata XVI-XV temple of Tell Balata/Shechem, reconducted this temple to the well-known type of MB III temples called “Migdol temple”. Recent analysis of the architectonical evolution of Temple 2048 and the buildings around (Cecconi in press) individuated four architectonical phases.
Temple 2048 has a south-west/north-east orientation, and it was built during Middle Bronze Age III/Late Bronze Age on an artificially raised platform. The temple, measuring 21.5 x 16.5 m, is made up of a single long room of 11.5x9.6 m, with massive walls built with two external block facades and a small rubble filling. The façade features two towers of varying sizes on each side: the eastern tower is larger than the western one, most likely due to the presence of a staircase. A niche was built at the center of the back wall of the temple, on a direct axis with the entrance. The temple was rebuilt in the second phase (Late Bronze Age I-II) using an ""ashlar stones"" technique: the easter tower was repaired and two columns were added at the outer entrance. In the third phase, dated to Late Bronze Age II, the inner niche was closed, and a platform was built in place of the external niche, modification celebrated by the deposition in this room of three hoards. The façade is distinguished in this phase by the proximity of the western tower to a casemate temenos wall that surrounded and delimited the sacred space around the temple. In the last phase, dated to the Iron Age I-II, the temple was rebuilt with considerable changes: from smaller dimensions to the appearance of both a niche and a platform, to the transformation of the towers of the entrance-hall into two cells and the removal of the previous casemate wall.
Temple 2048 is characterized by a bounding around of subsidiary buildings, that separate the temple from the urban layout. The function of these buildings is not clear: the findings testify a connection with the temple, and the presence of a high level social group, that was involved in the sacred ceremonies and in the local bureaucracy. 
This temple belongs to the urban ""Migdol Temples"" group (Susnow M., 2021, The Practice of Canaanite Cult. The Middle and Late Bronze Ages), an architectural typology well known in the Middle Bronze Age III-Late Bronze Southern Levant, at Hazor (Area H Temple), Tell Balata/Sichem and Pella. This temple is distinguished by specific criteria (Mazar A., 1992, Temples of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age, pp. 161-187 in The Architecture of Ancient Israel from the Prehistoric to the Persian Periods) involving most of their outside appearance, while the inner layout is highly varying. Important features of this model are the monumentality, dictated by the massive walls and the two towers on the façade, and the worship of a male deity (Ba’al or Reshef). These features are strictly associated to a visible rule by a local elite, whose central building was frequently the only one connected to the sacred region.",-1650,-1200,2004,1456,Gaia Cecconi,2023-06-03 14:21:43.456 +0200,2023-07-06 19:06:50.523 +0200,Godscapes project
1787,Ekphrasis of the Church of the Holy Apostles,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Ekphrasis of the Church of the Holy Apostles by Nikolaos Mesarites, a cleric who was skeuophylax of the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos and, following the fall of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, the metropolitan of Ephesus, constitutes one of the most complete textual sources for the reconstruction of that lost edifice as well as a formidable work of rhetorical artistry in keeping with the literary and cultural sophistication of Byzantine literature during this period. It is transmitted via the codexes Ambrosianus Graecus F93 and Ambrosianus Graecus F 96 which contain the entirety of his works, and begins with a description of the situation of the church, with special attention paid to the verdancy of its encircling gardens and the natural beauty of its site, which render the Church of the Holy Apostles not only a solemn religious space but also a sensual locus amoenus. Emphasis is also placed on the educational facilities attached to the complex and on the intellectual attainments cultivated within them, a motif which also reappears at the close of the ekphrasis with a description of the contentious debates between scholars regarding philosophical and scientific matters. The majority of the piece, however, is devoted to descriptions of the building itself, most particularly the extensive pictorial cycle which graced its interior and included scenes from the New Testament and the lives of the Apostles. Mesarites focuses on the effect upon the viewer of the narrative dynamism of the images, which invite him to treat each scene as an almost cinematographic ekphrasis embedded within the greater ekphrasis of the complex. Furthermore, attention is paid to the tombs of apostles and emperors, and to the architectural ornamentation of the interior, though the actual form of the building described is difficult to discern despite critical information provided by the text. Not only does the text provide a description, albeit partial, of a vanished monument, it also provides important clues to the ways in which medieval Romans saw their world, and the multivalent identities of an ecclesiastical complex as religious site, imperial mausoleum, prestigious school, and place of sensual delectation. Moreover, the ways in which Mesarites describes the act of viewing the cycle of images inside allows us to consider the ways in which the Byzantines experienced religious art beyond the icon.",1190,1200,1897,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-06-06 00:00:22.852 +0200,2023-06-10 23:11:37.734 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1788,First Temple (Jerusalem),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The First Temple, sometimes called ""Solomon's Temple,"" was likely built at some point in the 10th century BCE. The conventional dating for Solomon's reign is roughly 970-930 BCE and the Temple was completed at some point in the middle of the 10th century BCE, around 959. The Hebrew Bible contains descriptions of the temple, including an account of its destruction by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 587 BCE. Today, archaeologists are unable to conduct work on the site (Temple Mount), as the al-Aqsa Mosque currently sits there. Given that, details must be reconstructed through other historical sources. The Hebrew Bible describes the Temple as having three sections: an outer porch, a sanctuary, and an innermost shrine (the holy of holies). Additionally, Bronze age ""long-room"" temples from nearby Phoenician sites have similar layouts and features, which gives insight to what the First Temple may have looked like.",-960,-587,1983,1368,John Mellison,2023-06-06 22:29:00.572 +0200,2023-06-30 18:34:08.767 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1789,The Church of the Theotokos of the Pharos,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of the Theotokos of the Pharos was a chapel constructed in the eighth century in the midst of the Great Palace of Boukoleon in Constantinople (close to a lighthouse that gave the chapel its name) to house the instruments of Christ's Passion, which were soon joined by other celebrated items including the famous Mandylion of Edessa and numerous other relics. It is first attested in the entry of the Chronicle of Theophanes for the year 769 when it was the site of the wedding of Irene of Athens and Leo IV. After the end of Iconoclasm it was rededicated, an occasion which prompted Photios, who was patriarch at the time, to write a homily which offers us precious information regarding the church. In the intervening centuries, its collection of relics continued to grow, a fact attested by the itinerary of Anthony of Novgorod, as well as a list embedded in an account of the palace coup of John 'the Fat' Komnenos in 1200 authored by Nicholas Mesarites, who was skeuophylax of the church and was personally responsible for the care of its contents. During the sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, it avoided direct damage, and together with its contents was turned over into the care of the Latin Emperor Baldwin I. Nevertheless, the days of the Church of the Theotokos of the Pharos were numbered, and it presumably fell into disuse and ruin during the Latin occupation, as its contents were sold to fill the coffers of the beleaguered state. It is not attested in later sources. Relatively little can be ascertained regarding the form of the chapel save that it was small and extremely ornately decorated, features emphasized alike by Photios, Mesarites, Robert of Clari, and that it featured three apses, a central dome, and a narthex, suggesting that it, as restored in the 9th century, may have been an early example of the cross-in-square type. Moreover, given the Byzantine aesthetic predilection for intricate patterning and color, even the brief outlines which survive are suggestive to the historian's imagination, especially those that mention its impressive silver ciborium, its polychrome marble revetments, and the jewel-like opulence of its interior. Moreover, the appearance and especially the function of the chapel inspired that of La Sainte Chapelle (which would come to house much of the Pharos' former contents) as well as the Relic Chapel at Karlstejn.",760,1204,1400,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-06-06 23:05:36.673 +0200,2023-06-08 19:57:50.020 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1792,The Monastery of Mangana,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastery of St. George of the Mangana was a monastery founded on the easternmost extremity of the Constantinopolitan peninsula on the acropolis of ancient Byzantium in the vicinity of a formal Arsenal for siege weapons (Mangana), by Constantine IX Monomachos in the eleventh century, as part of a complex which included an imperial palace, a hospital, a law school, and various hostels for the indigent and the infirm, as well as extensive gardens. Michael Psellos, in his description of the Mangana complex which is incorporated into his famous Chronographia, describes a complex of elegant and richly ornamented buildings decorated with gilded motifs of stars and set on a level terrace amid verdant parkland and water features. The future ecumenical patriarch, Constantine Leichoudes, was given the pronoia of Mangana, though the exact nature of this grant is difficult to ascertain. Needless to say, it was following a swim in one of these ornamental ponds at the complex that the founder and builder of the complex, Constantine IX Monomachos, would die of pleurisy and be buried in the complex alongside his mistress Skleraina. Following an interval of more than a hundred years, during which the richly endowed complex presumably continued to prosper, during the reign of Isaac II Angelos at the end of the twelfth century, it seems that much of the complex save the monastery itself was demolished to provide building material for the Church of the Archangel Michael at Anaplous further along the Bosporus. Following an occupation by Latin monks following the Fourth Crusade, the monastery went on to play an important role in Byzantine ecclesiastical politics in the Palaiologan era, serving as the location of a Synod in 1279, and as the place of retirement of John VI Kantakouzenos in the 1350's. After the Ottoman Conquest of Constantinople, the building was repurposed as a dervish convent, before being leveled to accommodate the construction of the Topkapi Palace in the 1460's. In 1871 a portion of its ruins were destroyed during the construction of a railway. In the early 1920's during the occupation of Istanbul in the aftermath of World War I, the substructures of the building were excavated  by the French military and their contours recorded by archaeologists, the findings of whom suggested a cross-in-square church of sizable dimensions with an adjoining portico and perhaps a freestanding octagonal chapel beside it. These remains still exist in some form, though inaccessible to the public in a closed off area of the Topkapi Palace.",1050,1460,1400,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-06-07 22:32:13.287 +0200,2024-02-10 04:17:27.114 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1793,Monothelitism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Monothelitism, or monotheletism was a theological teaching, according to which Jesus Christ had only one will, being thus contrary to dyothelitism, the Christological formula that held that Jesus Christ had two wills, a divine and a human. Monothelitism emerged as a result of the Christological controversies that were related to the monophysitism of Eutyches of Constantinople, and the miaphysitist formula of the followers of St. Cyril of Alexandria. During the 5th century there was turmoil in some regions of the Byzantine Empire due to the debates over the nature of Jesus Christ. Although the official doctrine of the Church determined that Christ is indeed the son of God, His exact nature nevertheless remained open to speculation. During the debates over Arianism, the first Council of Nicaea in 325 had declared as heretical the idea that Jesus Christ is not fully divine, while it also made clear that Jesus is God, the Son of God who became human. However, in arguing that Jesus is both God and man, a conflict emerged relating to the way that the human and divine natures actually exist within the person of Christ. At the Council of Chalcedon, in 451, the Eastern Orthodox Church defined that Jesus Christ had two distinct natures, a divine and a human; yet they come together within His one hypostasis. This means that Jesus Christ is known as both fully human and fully Divine, one in being with the Father. This doctrinal formula was opposed by the Monophysites, who held that Christ possessed only one nature. They held that the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ were fused into one new single nature. As described by Eutyches, Jesus’ human nature was dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea, so His nature is only the divine one. 
These debates led the Chalcedonians to accuse the non-Chalcedonians of teaching Christ's humanity to be of a different kind from our own; while the non-Chalcedonians accused the Chalcedonians of following a form of Nestorianism, the belief, that is, that Jesus Christ was two distinct subsistences.
The doctrinal turmoil was dangerous for the Byzantine Empire, which was under constant threat, especially as many of the areas most likely to be lost to the Empire were the regions that were in favor of Monophysites, who considered the hierarchy at Constantinople to be heretics. In these provinces, the non-Chalcedonians were far more numerous than the Chalcedonians. Under these circumstances, the Monothelite formula emerged as a compromise position. The Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610-641) tried to promote monothelitism as a unifying doctrine, that would reconcile and eventually unite the divided Christian factions within the Empire. His goal was to win over the non-Chalcedonians, since they already believed that Jesus Christ has a single nature, therefore He holds a single will. For this reason, Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople (610-638) came up with a christological formula, which the Emperor Heraclius released as an edict in 638. The edict proclaimed that Christ has two natures but a single will. But both the Emperor and the Patriarch had not counted on the popes at Rome. Pope Severinus condemned Heraclius’s edict, while his successor, Pope John IV (640–642), also rejected the doctrine completely, leading to a major schism between the eastern and western Church. The schism remained for the next few years. Meanwhile in Africa, a monk, Maximus the Confessor, carried on a furious campaign against Monothelitism, and in 646, he convinced the African councils to draw up a manifesto against the doctrine, which they forwarded to the new pope, Theodore I (642–649), who, in turn, wrote to Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople to outline the heretical nature of Monothelitism. Monothelitism was finally condemned at the Council of Constantinople (Sixth Ecumenical Counci) took place from 680 to 681. Participants included the Pope’s representatives, representatives from the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem, while the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch were present in person. It condemned the Monothelite doctrine as one that diminished the fullness of Christ's humanity and asserted Dyothelitism to be the true doctrine, with Christ possessing two natural wills and two natural energies, without division, alteration, separation or confusion.",456,681,13,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-06-09 17:10:13.793 +0200,2023-06-16 11:33:34.333 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1794,A Mathematician,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This short ethopoiia, or rhetorical personification, of a former teacher at the Patriarchal School of Hagia Sophia who was passed over for the see of Antioch in the years immediately after the Fourth Crusade, comes to us from the pen of the Byzantine bishop and literatus Nikolaos Mesarites, transmitted, along with the rest of his works, through Ambrosianus Graecus F93 and Ambrosianus Graecus F96. It is a critical corroborative source for some of the dimensions of Byzantine ecclesiastical politics in the earliest years of the Empire of Nicaea, as well as for the intrigue surrounding the appointment of an Orthodox Patriarch to the see of Antioch in 1205-1206. Effectively, during a succession crisis in the principality of Antioch, the Patriarchate had become vacant, and an Orthodox bishop, Symeon II, chosen from among the local Melkite community had been appointed by the Latin prince without reference to the exiled Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Evidently, the subject of the poem would have been endowed with the office by the Laskarid court, but the appointment of an Orthodox Patriarch in the person of Symeon II forced the emperor, in reluctant deference to the whims of a prince of the Outremer, to withdraw his candidate. The ethopoiia, therefore, is best read as a rhetorical device meant to salvage the reputation of those concerned by imputing to the candidate an unsuitable and preening fixation on astrology as a pretext for the retraction of the offered benefice. Likewise, in a context in which Nikolaos Mesarites and his brother Ioannes, in concert with those Byzantines who still remained in occupied Constantinople,  were advocating for the appointment of another patriarch to the throne of the Latin-held capital, an action that relied on the case of Antioch to demonstrate precedent, it follows that it would have been in Mesarites' interests to discredit the subject of the ethopoiia. The tone of the piece, written in the voice of the failed candidate, is profoundly misanthropic, and fixated upon astrology as a means by which to deal with his own overweening ambition and moral turpitude, while also promising to assume a host of ailments in order to put a stop to the scorn of his associates. An aspect of the text which is not immediately obvious is the way in which it attests, albeit indirectly, to the diverse fields of knowledge in which a Byzantine bishop might be thought, however slanderously, to dabble, and bears out the critical place which astrology held in Byzantine understandings of their world even among the elite and those within the religious establishment.",1206,1207,1124,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2023-06-10 23:49:40.855 +0200,2023-06-11 00:19:39.547 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1796,Annals of Quedlinburg,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Annals of Quedlinburg, written at Quedlinburg Abbey, detail the imperial and daily activities at the abbey until 1030 CE. The account is supplemented by a chronicle of global history that includes Biblical events, placing Quedlinburg in a longer Christian history. Details of events such as church consecrations, imperial visits, and feast days are present throughout the chronicle. Of particular interest is the interaction between the Holy Roman Emperor and his court with the nuns at Quedlinburg, many of whom were noble or royal family members. The Ottonian dynasty was particularly close to Quedlinburg, ensuring Imperial favor in the area. Thus, the text is valuable as a historical source for the region around Quedlinburg in the eleventh century, the imperial court, and the daily life at the Abbey. The text contains the first mention of Lithuania, and is considered a fairly accurate source for relations between the Empire and northeastern cultures in the eleventh century.

1799,Teotihuacán,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Teotihuacán, también conocido como Tollán-Teotihuacán en idioma Náhuatl, significa el “Lugar Sagrado donde los Hombres se hacen Dioses”. Fue la sede de una de las sociedades más complejas que existieron en el México prehispánico.
Sus orígenes se remontan al 400 a.n.e., que es cuando comienzan a llegar los primeros pobladores del valle. Se trata de aldeas y caseríos dispersos dedicados a la agricultura, la caza y la recolección. De esta manera, la sociedad teotihuacana debió conformarse desde sus inicios por la integración de diversos grupos etnolingüísticos.
Hasta el primer siglo de nuestra era, la agricultura constituía el factor fundamental de la economía. Grandes obras hidráulicas fueron construidas para incrementar la productividad agrícola.
Sin embargo, alrededor del segundo siglo de nuestra era, se produjo un cambio radical en el sistema de producción. Dado que aún cultivando todas las tierras disponibles, la producción era insuficiente para mantener a una población tan numerosa, se clausuran las obras hidráulicas y se dejan de producir alimentos. El Estado favorece la importación de alimentos y desarrolla una estrategia para satisfacer la enorme demanda de alimentos y muchos otros recursos demandados por una población tan numerosa y en constante aumento. Las antiguas parcelas de cultivo son invadidas por el rápido crecimiento de la mancha urbana. La separación entre parcelas se transforman en calles y donde antiguamente estaban los canales para el riego se construyen drenajes que colectan los escurrimiento de los conjuntos arquitectónicos, todos éstos dispuestos con la misma orientación y de dimensiones muy similares,  
Teotihuacán inaugura un modo de vida urbano. La población residente en el conjunto urbano, se dedica mayoritariamente a la producción de bienes y servicios, estableciéndose una clara separación entre el medio rural y la ciudad. 
Entre el 100 y el 550 de n.e., Teotihuacán alcanzó su máximo apogeo y extendió su dominio e influencia sobre un amplio territorio. Extiende la red de vínculos económicos y sociales  hasta Centroamérica, manteniendo contactos de diversos tipos con ciudades mayas.
Era el mayor centro de producción, distribución y consumo de toda clase de bienes en Mesoamérica y se posiciona en el centro de una extensa red de vínculos. La manufactura y distribución de artefactos de obsidiana constituía una parte fundamental de la economía, sin embargo muchos otros productos de los cientos de talleres se distribuyen en el mercado local y regional. 
Teotihuacán se constituía también como un gran santuario, atrayendo no solo a miles de peregrinos, sino a la gente de las antiguas comunidades que seguramente se veían fascinados por la oportunidad de participar en la construcción del mayor centro religioso de su época.
En el conjunto urbano la población residente de manera permanente pudo ser de 175000 y hasta 200000 personas. Además, cada día miles de personas procedentes de todo el territorio mesoamericano, asistían en peregrinaje al mayor santuario de su tiempo. La población local y los peregrinos participaban en las fastuosas ceremonias rituales que se celebrarían en los grandes espacios públicos.
En la época de mayor apogeo, la ciudad se extendió hasta 22.5 kilómetros cuadrados y estaba conformada por más de 2000 conjuntos arquitectónicos. 
El centro cívico ceremonial se constituía por tres grandes complejos arquitectónicos; el de las pirámides del Sol, de La Luna y La Ciudadela, los cuales se encuentran integrados por la Calzada de los Muertos, una gran avenida procesional orientada de norte a sur de casi cuatro kilómetros de longitud, la cual está limitada a ambos lados por numerosos edificios públicos, templos y altares.
La ciudad se organizaba en barrios, cada uno con templos y edificios públicos donde se ejercía el gobierno y se administraban los recursos de la comunidad; también estaban los conjuntos residenciales ocupados por las familias de la élite y los conjuntos habitacionales que servían como vivienda de los grupos domésticos dedicados a la producción artesanal especializada. En cada conjunto había al menos una unidad dedicada al culto religioso, donde sacerdotes o individuos de mayor estatus se encargaban de conducir el ritual. Al interior de cada conjunto arquitectónico había al menos un altar para la práctica ritual, por lo que cualquier aspecto de la vida cotidiana y pública estaba vinculado a la religión.
En las plazas públicas de cada barrio se instalaba el mercado y durante las festividades religiosas realizadas en fechas establecidas en el calendario sagrado, se celebraban los rituales comunitarios y se rendía culto a las deidades patronas.
Aunque no se ha descubierto hasta ahora ningún documento escrito, hay evidencias que confirman la existencia de un avanzado sistema de escritura. Tampoco hay evidencias sobre la lengua que se hablaba, sin embargo, se ha propuesto que la lengua dominante hablada en una ciudad cosmopolita con lo fue Teotihuacán, era un antecedente de la lengua náhuatl que aún se habla hoy en día entre algunas comunidades indígenas de México.
Alrededor del 700 d.n.e., varios factores llevan al colapso, los edificios públicos fueron incendiados y la ciudad fue paulatinamente abandonada.
Hoy en día, Teotihuacán es el sitio arqueológico con la mayor superficie excavada y expuesta al publico, siendo el lugar donde se ha realizado el mayor número de excavaciones e investigaciones de todo México. Sin lugar a dudas, es un referente para la compresión del desarrollo de la civilización mesoamericana.
El sitio arqueológico de Teotihuacán, constituye por muchas razones un punto nodal para la investigación y comprensión del desarrollo de las antiguas culturas mexicanas. La investigación que se realiza en Teotihuacán de manera formal desde finales del siglo XIX, ha incluido aspectos como el surgimiento de las clases sociales y el Estado, los sistemas de producción, distribución y consumo; también se investigan aspectos sobre el pensamiento mágico religioso, la cosmovisión y la ritualidad. Hay importantes estudios sobre la astronomía antigua, que se vinculan con el sistema calendárico y diversos elementos de la cosmovisión.
Muy importantes son los estudios sobre el urbanismo y la arquitectura, las formas de organización y uso del espacio construido, visto como un producto social. 
En el ámbito del simbolismo de las diferentes expresiones estéticas, los estudios iconográficos han sido fundamentales para la comprensión de aspectos del orden social y la ideología.
Los estudios sobre el medio ambiente y las características de la población humana, han sido determinantes para conocer aspectos sobre las condiciones de vida y salud de la gente que habitó la ciudad. 
Otros estudios se han avocado al entendimiento de las razones y circunstancias por las cuales  sociedades tan poderosas e influyentes como lo fue Teotihuacán se colapsan.
Sin lugar a dudas la investigación en Teotihuacán es importante y un referente para comprender el desarrollo de la humanidad.",-400,650,1989,1291,Sergio Gómez Chávez,2023-06-17 08:20:54.636 +0200,2024-02-13 04:19:03.202 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1801,Red Temple/Temple D2 (Tell Mardikh/ancient Ebla),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Red Temple (Temple D2) is a monumental temple building erected in the ancient city of Ebla (present-day Tell Mardikh). It dates back to the age of the Royal Archives of the great Early Syrian town, c. 2400–2300 BCE (in the traditional conventional chronology), that is the Early Bronze IVA of north-western inland Syria chronology: it must have been built in an advanced phase of Early Bronze IVA, around 2350 BCE, as it was erected after a north peripheral sector of the West Unit of the Royal Palace had been dismissed and razed. It is so far the only identified cult building belonging to the age of the Archives, along with the Temple of the Rock in the Lower Town South-East: together with the Archive’ texts, these two sanctuaries offer crucial insights into the religious phenomena in Ebla and Syria in the mature Early Syrian Period; and provide evidence of the unity and specificity of the religious architectural tradition of inland Syria in the central part of the third millennium BCE, when the in-antis temple model spreads.
The Red Temple has been excavated in Area D, underneath the imposing Old Syrian lshtar’s Temple dating to the Middle Bronze I–II. The temple was built on the western edge of the Acropolis and near the Royal Palace G, overlooking from the north the imposing ceremonial and administrative wings of the palace itself. It has certainly to be identified with the Temple of Kura within the SA.ZA (the central palatine administrative complex of the mature Early Syrian town) and represented the dynastic sanctuary of the lords of Ebla. Kura was, in fact, the patron god of the city and the main divinity of Ebla in the second half of the third millennium BCE. For this reason, the dynastic temple of the Old Syrian Period, dedicated to the great goddess Ishtar, new patron deity of the Eblaite dynasty, was built over its ruins.
As described in the text of the “Ritual of Kingship”, the elaborate ritual of the renewal of kingship, which began at the Temple of Kura near the town wall and the Kura Gate (now identified with the Temple of the Rock), and which involved a series of ritual acts and pilgrimages performed together by the king and queen, concluded in this temple with the enthronement of the royal couple. At the same time as the king and the queen entered the temple, the cult statues of Kura and Barama (the supreme divine couple) entered the building.
The temple (some 24.20 m long and 17 m wide) takes its name from the dark red colour of its bricks. It was oriented with the entrance towards south, like the later Middle Bronze I–II Ishtar’s Temple on the same place. It adheres to the typology of the in antis temple, well attested in the Syro-Levantine religious architecture from the mid-third millennium BCE. It has a moderately longroom – almost square – cella (L.9980), nearly 10.20 m long by 9.40 m wide, and a rather deep vestibule (L.9990), 6.70 m long by 9.40 m wide, delimitated by projecting antae. The building features strong similarities with the Temple of the Rock for its typology, size, and proportions. However, in the Red Temple four columns divided the cella into three small naves and two further columns formed a porch in the vestibule; the column bases were massive limestone cylinders. Finally, three steps of accurately worked limestone slabs formed a short entrance staircase to the vestibule porch. The temple had thick walls (about 3.60/3.80 m); while at all four corners of the building there were low buttresses, approximately 0.20/0.30 m.
The Red Temple was destroyed at the same time as the whole settlement of the age of the Royal Archives, at the end of Early Bronze IVA, around 2300 BCE (Matthiae 2021, pp. 65–83, 301–303).",-2400,-2300,1991,1184,Maura Sala,2023-06-21 17:19:29.101 +0200,2023-08-11 12:07:40.631 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1802,Ishtar’s Temple/Temple D on the Acropolis (Tell Mardikh/ancient Ebla),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Temple D on the Acropolis is an imposing temple building erected in the ancient city of Ebla (present-day Tell Mardikh), the most important cult building within the Citadel of the Old Syrian town. It dates back to c. 2000–1600 BCE (in the traditional middle chronology), the Middle Bronze I–II of north-western inland Syria chronology. It was the dynastic sanctuary dedicated to the great Ishtar, the city goddess and the patron goddess of the Old Syrian kings of Ebla during the age of the Amorite Dynasties. This is testified by fragments of monumental furniture that portray the great goddess and her attributes, found inside and outside the temple: a limestone double basin still in place within the temple, with mythical and ritual depictions in relief on three of the sides; a second fragmentary basalt basin from inside the temple; and two basalt votive monuments which probably stood in the open air in front of the sanctuary, the lshtar’s Stele discovered in 1986 and the lshtar’s Obelisk, partially recovered and reconstructed from two large fragments in 2006. As far as written evidence is concerned, Temple D on the Acropolis is the one mentioned in the inscription carved on lbbit-Lim’s basalt statue (found reused at a short distance from the facade of the temple), which commemorates the dedication to the goddess Ishtar of a basin (perhaps one of the two found inside the temple).
The temple was probably erected during the first decades of the second millennium BCE. It stood along the western edge of the fortified Acropolis, over a large mudbrick terrace which enclosed the levelled ruins of the previous Early Bronze IVA Kura’s Temple in the SA.ZA.
The building (some 30 m long and 11.50 m wide), facing south, had a longitudinal, axial, tripartite structure (with vestibule, antecella and cella), with an entrance delimitated by projecting antae: a layout that from now on will characterize the palatine and dynastic temples in the Levant, erected in the citadels close to royal palaces. It featured a quite short vestibule preceded by two steps (L.213), an equally short antecella (L.211), and a marked longroom cella (L.202), 12.40 m long and 7.20 m wide; such a marked longitudinal development of the cella is canonical in the Middle Bronze Age temples in Ebla and inland Syria (a few exceptions can be mentioned, as the Alalakh VII Temple and the MBA Hadad’s Temple in Aleppo). The cella had a low bench against the back wall, onto which opened a quite deep, almost square niche for the cult image. Several remains of important basalt and limestone cult fittings (e.g., two basins and an offering table) were found inside the cella. Moreover, the entrance to the cella probably featured basalt jambs decorated with two big carved images of lying lions. In front of the temple there was a large open space, gradually sloping towards the south, which housed monumental cult fittings, including a big limestone round basin found in situ.
Ishtar’s Temple on the Citadel was destroyed around 1600 BCE, when the whole Old Syrian city was devastated by a Hittite-Hurrian coalition headed by Mursili I of Hatti and Pizikarra of Nineveh (Matthiae 1981, 114–116, 130–132; 2021, pp. 198–203, 322–325).",-2000,-1600,2001,1184,Maura Sala,2023-06-21 17:34:34.154 +0200,2023-09-11 11:19:12.495 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1805,Wahhabisme الوهّابيّة,43,Religious Group (v6),"Certains considèrent que la rencontre qui eut lieu entre Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab et Muhammad bin Saud en 1744 marqua non seulement la naissance de l'histoire moderne du Najd, mais aussi le début d'une renaissance religieuse et politique majeure dans la péninsule arabique en particulier , et dans le monde islamique en général.

1806,Sango Religious group in Oyo,43,Religious Group (v6),"Oyo people are one of the  indigenous religious society among the Yoruba race in Oyo state, Nigeria. There population is  about 471,000. They speak Oyo dialect of  Yoruba  version language.  The people once an empire came into limelight around fifteen centuries. From oral history, the town was founded by Oranmiyan the last son of Oduduwa, the great ancestor of the Yoruba people. The religious and political existence of the people have the traces of migration linked with Ife origin due to common ancestral genealogy shared by all other Yoruba cities.  They have a ritual tradition which is spectacular but attached to Sango festival and oya festival. Oya  was the wife of  sango  during his life time. They showcased this festival with Bata drum and it makes it distinct for ritual practices. Sango is recognized as the spirit of thunder and lightning; he became the king of Oyo around sixteen centuries. He was known to be an historical figure with strange and unpredictable character. Their indigenous religion is known as Isese (Yoruba: Ìṣẹ̀ṣe) and is still practiced by a number of Yoruba people. It has also been incorporated into new religious traditions throughout the African diaspora. Oyo people developed customs such as brotherhood, the ruling of Alaafins, traditional art, drumming, spiritual dances and they speak Yoruba language like other tribes. Their belief and heritage make them distinct from another tribe. They have a unique talent in drawing and sculpturing. the Oyo Empire’s cultural heritage requires explaining spiritual dances and masquerades’ origins, as their philosophy is different from the modern. The religious practices of the Oyo people have a diffused system in which the orisas are considered as the messenger of divine creator. There is an understanding of nature and spirits in the template of their spirituality and religiosity. This explain more better their ethical devises in which makes man responsible and thus adhere to the maintenance of golden rule of law (law of karma) guided by nature as a paramount claim in human justice and socio communal relationship. The role and depth of Oyo’s influence in nurturing a Yoruba identity and consciousness among the Yoruba has continued to resonate across generations and boundaries. The Yoruba who today are found in the Southwestern part of Nigeria, the Republics of Benin and Togo, Brazil, Cuba, Trinidad and other places in the Caribbean have continued to imagine the glory and renown of the empire and the consciousness created by the Oyo and its Alaafins. Oyo has continued to live on in the lives, arts and the socio-cultural, economic and political arrangements prevalent among the Yoruba people, their neighbors and the African Diaspora
The date picked for this study is determined by the development that occurred in Yoruba land  within the period.1800 was the beginning  of the disruption caused by the Fulani Muslim  jihadist all over Yoruba kingdom and Oyo  Empire. It is then important to see if the disruption in any way  affects the religious tradition of the oyo people till 1900 before modern independence.",1800,1900,1995,1460,olusegun oladosu,2023-06-24 16:38:08.550 +0200,2023-10-24 18:48:42.282 +0200,Personal Expertise

The movement was a rejoinder of Ibn Fodio's effort to educate women and limit the level of illiteracy among the feminine gender that was consistently observed in educational less-advantageous personalities before the establishment of the caliphate. His educated daughter sustained the effort that remained a Teacher, educationist, and political figure in the region who published books in Hausa and Fulbe languages to draw Islamic awareness closer to those at low levels.

1810,Shang Oracle Bone Inscriptions,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Shang oracle bone inscriptions refer to the records of pyro-osteomancy, or the burning of bones for divination purposes, conducted by the religious elites of the Shang dynasty 商 (1600(?)-1047 BCE). While evidence of North China Plains pyro-osteomancy is known to predate the Shang by some two millennia, the practice did not become widespread until the late 3rd and early 2nd millennium BCE, and only during the Late Shang dynasty (1200-1046 BCE) did it become an intensive, state-sponsored institution tied up with efforts to consolidate political and religious authority (Flad 2008). In a typical Late Shang divination, one face of an animal bone, usually an ox scapula or turtle plastron, was drilled with a series of hollows. When an intense heat source (a branch or rod) was applied to these hollows, the bone plate rapidly expanded and produced cracks on the reverse face. The shape, or perhaps sound, of a crack was interpreted as an auspicious or inauspicious omen in connection to a divination ""charge” (e.g. ‘It will rain tomorrow’). Beginning in the reign of King Wu Ding 武丁 (ca. 1200 BCE), highly formulaic records of divinations were usually inscribed onto the bone, sometimes long after the initial bone-cracking procedure had taken place (Keightley 2000). The most detailed inscriptions comprise multiple parts: a preface including the divination date and diviner’s name, the charge, the Shang king's prognostication based on his interpretation of the cracks, and a ""verification"" ostensibly recording the actual outcome (e.g. ‘it really did rain’). During the early phase of the Late Shang, divination was conducted on virtually every major issue of the day, including ritual sacrifice, military alliances, invasions, harvests, illnesses, childbirth, and dreams. Towards the end of the Shang, ritual activities were assigned to a ritual calendar, and the earlier ad hoc divinations began to vanish. Instead, divination was used almost exclusively to test the likelihood of disaster in the upcoming 10-day week. The significance of oracle bones was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century, when eminent scholar and Dean of the Hanlin Academy, Wang Yirong 王懿榮 (1845-1900), noticed fragments of ‘decayed tortoise shell’ proscribed to treat his guest’s malaria was inscribed with characters resembling Western Zhou (1046-771 BCE) bronze inscriptions. Shortly after, a burgeoning market for these ancient curios drove collectors and treasure-seekers to the source at Xiaotun village 小屯村, in Anyang 安陽, Henan 河南, where at least nine private digs between 1900-1928 uncovered further fragments (Li Chi 1977: 1-14). Already in 1910, Scholarly analysis of these materials led to the conjecture that Xiaotun village occupied the site of the last Shang capital, Yinxu 殷墟 (lit. ‘the waste of Yin’) – a claim ultimately vindicated by official excavations led by the newly formed Institute of History and Philology between 1928-1936 (Li Chi 1977). Today, the corpus of over 150,000 inscribed oracle bones constitutes the most important source for reconstructing the social, political, economic, and religious activities of the Late Shang. At the most basic level, Shang oracle bone divinations reveal a conception of futurity which is contingent and open-ended. The future, for the Shang, represents the dominion of capricious spirits and deities whom the Shang attempted to assuage and domesticate through various forms of ritual intervention. Thus, having determined the date of an impending disaster, further divinations were typically conducted to determine the ritual actions required to secure supernatural assistance and forestall calamity. Assistance might come from one of any number of Shang deities and spirits. In general terms, the Shang pantheon consisted of an all-powerful, if distant and usually uncommunicative god, Di 帝 at the top, with a panoply of ancestral, pseudo-ancestral, local, and natural spirits below, among whom the more recently deceased seem the most communicative, and each of whom was associated with a circumscribed sphere of influence (e.g. disease, harvest, weather, warfare, etc.) (K.C. Chang 1976; Akatsuka Kiyoshi 赤塚忠 1977; Keightley 2000).",-1200,-1046,7,1203,Henry Jacobs,2023-06-26 10:57:28.603 +0200,2023-10-07 21:00:58.597 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1812,The Prison Chronicle,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"During the high middle ages, conflicts between the worldly magnates such as kings/princes/emperors and between the power holders of the church such as archbishops/popes/bishops were a quite common feature seen quite often across Europe. One such situation is seen in Denmark in the late 1200s with a severe conflict breaking out between king Erik Menved of Denmark and archbishop Jens Grand of Lund. One, both highly important and probably also somewhat internationally unusual, source to this conflict is a chronicle probably written sometime after 23. December 1297, but before 23. February 1302. It is commonly called the prison chronicle and it documents the events around the archbishop´s longstanding imprisonment. It seems to have been written by an anonymous cathedral canon from Lund archbishopric and seems to have been based partially on eye witness accounts and partially on the contemporary archives of Lund archbishopric. Although the chronicle should not be mistaken for a hagiographic text, as Jens Grand was also still alive when it was written, its author clearly imitates the genre of hagiography and portrays Jens Grand almost as a martyr saint in the chronicle. However, due to the strange circumstances of transmission, the original latin version of the chronicle is long lost, though, and the chronicle is now preserved only in a Danish translation edition produced by early Danish historian Arild Huitfeldt (1546-1609). Unfortunately, this also means that the chronicle has been completely unavailable as source materiale, up until now, for all foreign historians and researchers internationally not able to read Danish. For this very reason, instead of writing a prolonged introduction text to this entry, I have made it a priority instead to let the chronicle speak for itself by retelling its main content thus for the very first ever making the chronicle somewhat available to an international audience.   
Resumé or retelling of the main content of The Prison Chronicle:
[It starts out with a short introduction left out here as its originality has been disputed].
[chapter 1]: In the year 1294, on the friday before Palm Sunday, in the morning between 5 and 6 AM, after Mass, Duke Christoffer was sent to archbishop Jens Grand of Lund in order to spy on him. He was sent by King Erik Menved of Denmark who was present in the town of Lund at the time. Duke Christoffer now talks to the archbishop telling him that king Erik is hostile towards him and offers to try to reconcile them. Archbishop Jens Grand claims to be unaware of having offended the king and accepts his offer. Before Christoffer leaves the archbishop then gives him 3 valuable gifts. Christoffer then leaves to consult with the king and afterwards arrives at the episcopal seat once again. Christoffer leads Jens Grand to believe that the king is with him this time, bus as soon as the archbishop goes outside to meet him, Duke Christoffer takes him prisoner on behalf of the king. Christoffer then walks into the choir of Lund cathedral where he takes also dean Jacob prisoner in the midst of church service still wearing his ecclesistical garments. Having done that Christoffer and his men then raids the houses of Jacob and Jens Grand stealing all their valuables. Jens Grand and dean Jacob are then led to the place where the king is staying and from there they are taken on the road and away from Lund while being humiliated in different ways along the way.
[chapter 2]: Archbisop Jens Grand and dean Jacob arrives in the town of Helsingborg from where they are both thrown onto the Elsinore-Helsingborg ferry. While still being humiliated along the way, they are both being ferried to Zealand. Here, on that very same night, they are both jailed and chained in the royal castle of Søborg in Northern Zealand. The archbishop is jailed in the deepest dungeon below the tower and dean Jacob is put in another prison. The next morning dean Jacob is taken away to the royal castle of Kalundborg elsewhere on Zealand where he is now also jailed and chained in the deepest dungeon below the tower. The rest of the chapter describes how unfair it is that they were jailed and how extremely harsh the archbishop´s conditions were while he was jailed. The archbishop becomes gravely ill because of this, but is denied a doctor and is also denied access to his religious books as well as to reading light. Having been stashed away like this for 36 weeks, he is moved to another prison farther up in the tower, but he still remains chained.    
[chapter 3]: King Erik Menved arrives at Søborg castle to celebrate christmas there. On the second day after christmas archbishop Jens Grand is asked by an envoy from amongst the king´s men whether he would like to reconcile with the king. Jens Grand then answered by asking why he should reconcile with him when he had never knowningly had any quarrels with him in the first place - asking: should I reconcile with him because he has imprisoned me when I was innocent? Jens Grand is then told that the king holds grudges against you because your kin participated in the murder of his father king Erik Klipping. Jens Grand then answered that I have already proven before him and before the council of the realm that I did not approve of that and that I did not even now about it until after it had already happened. The king then gave me a document as proof of his friendship and the queen dowager and the council helped me become archbishop. Ever since that I have served him faithfully. All of this I trust onto God. On the fourth day after this, two Danish bishops, who were allied with the king, arrived together with some members of the council of the realm. They all requested urgently that Jens Grand should reconcile with the king. Jens Grand then answered by repeating that he never knowningly had any quarrels with the king in the first place and that he is willing to stand trial. The king´s men then hands Jens Grand a document and threatens to keep him imprisoned for the rest of his life unless he seals this document. The content of the of document is then referenced in detail containing 8 specified points all of which the archbishop would have to promise to keep before his release from prison. They read the document to him, but Jens Grand answered that he would rather see king Erik cut off all limbs from his body before would give his consent to any of that. They then go back to the king with this answer and the king is enraged even saying to some that he would never let Jens Grand out of prison even if he was excommunicated a hundred times by the pope. It is told that Duke Christoffer would like to escape excommuncation, but that the king wouldn´t let him. 
[chapter 4]: The chapter starts out by listing the names of all 18 knights and men who were together with Duke Christoffer when he imprisoned the archbishop. Afterwards it tells about how duke Christoffer travelled back to Lund after he had imprisoned Jens Grand at Søborg castle. In Lund he entered the cathedral and broke into the sacristy where he broke up the chest which held all the documents and privileges of the church. He then tore off the seals from a large number of them and lit a fire in the choir before the altar where he burned them. All the gold and  money and treasures and valuables of the cathedral which were kept in the sacristy duke Christoffer then took. He then gathered all the cathedral canons in the choir where he threatened them all on their life and estates unless they broke the interdict at once. In the name of the king, he also banned them from writing to the pope or to anyone else for help and support. Because of this no one in Denmark dared writing to the pope in Rome.
[chapter 5]: A cathedral canon from Lund called Hans Sibrandtsøn, who were studying in France at the time, got word that archbishop Jens Grand had been imprisoned and then travelled to the pope to complain that the King of Denmark had imprisoned the archbishop. Pope Celestine V then wrote king Erik Menved ordering him to release Jens Grand and dean Jacob from prison and return their estates and money to them, but Erik Menved had the papal messenger murdered as soon as he had delivered the letter so that no one would know what had become of him.  Dean Jacob managed to escape from the tower of Kalundborg castle after having been imprisoned there for 27 weeks and travelled to Ribe in Denmark planning on going to Rome. Erik Menved got word that he was in Ribe and tried to have him apprehended there, but Jacob fled the country and met with Pope Boniface VIII. This pope then sent papal legates to Denmark ordering Erik Menved to release Jens Grand and gave them authority to make king Erik stand trial. The pope also wrote all Danish bishops ordering them to help the papal legates and he authorized his legates to excommunicate Denmark and declare interdict if the king refused to release the archbishop from prison. Pope Boniface VIII also wrote to the clerics from Lund at Hammershus castle on Bornholm allowing them to give church service even though Denmark had been excommunicated and encourage them to retain from giving in to royal threats and not hand over this, rightfully archepiscopal, castle at Hammerhus to the king or his bailiffs. But while the papal legate was still on his way from Rome to Denmark, Jens Grand escaped from his prison in the tower of Søborg castle the chronicle now says.
[chapter 6]: The chapter tells in great detail the story of how an unnamed cook at Søborg castle helped Jens Grand escape. The cook was drinking with the gaolers and pretended that he had got very drunk. Pretending to be drunk he offered the imprisoned archbishop his help by sending a message to the pope in Rome or to anywhere else, but the gaoler did not take it seriously as he thought that the cook had said it because of drunkenness. Jens Grand meanwhile kept quiet. On the very next day the cook drank with the gaolers once again. While some of the gaolers had left to go to sleep and others had shortly run errands, the cook repeated his offer to the archbishop. Having understood that he meant it seriously, the archbishop instructed the cook to go Hans Rodis, canon in Copenhagen, and make him send the archbishop pen, ink and a rope ladder. The cook then left and soon came back with the things he had been instructed to fetch and the archbishop then wrote to the clecrics at Hammerhus castle instructing them to send a ship including supplies to the coast near Søborg castle while pretending to be fishermen. The cook then left to deliver the letter  and meanwhile Jens Grand worked on chains with a file. By the grace of God no one neither heard this nor inspected the chains while this work took place. The archbishop in this way managed to free himself from the chains, but was so weakened that he could hardly stand or walk. The cook then came back and told him that the ship had arrived. At that time, though, the king was at Søborg castle personally and therefore they had to pretend to be fishing and only come back to the coast near Søborg at night. By the grace of God no rumours of the strange fishermen reached the ears of the king, however, and God also made king Erik Menved leave Søborg castle entirely to go hunting near Tikøb taking all of his men with him leaving behind only one single gaoler and a few men including his sister´s two sons. After the king had left, the remaining men began a drinking party and the cook drank with the gaoler and got him so drunk that he left to go to sleep. As soon as they had all gone to sleep, the cook tied the rope ladder to the iron in the window and helped the archbishop down the ladder, the cook going first and the archbishop after him. Having  almost reached the ground, the archbishop had no more strength left in him, but the cook managed to ward off his fall. While the archbishop recovered, the cook removed the rope ladder in the way he had planned. The cook then led and carried Jens Grand to an arrow slit and from there they both climbed down the outer wall via the rope ladder with the cook climbing first. The lake and the moat were both frozen and the ice solid, thus after removing the rope ladder, the cook led Jens Grand across the frozen moat to the staples. The archbishop now had no more strength left and therefore asked the cook to go into the staples and take two horses. They rode from there down to the beach where they arrived an hour before sunrise. The cook then let the two horses run free and entered the ship together with the archbishop. Then follows a description of their sail through Øresund to Bornholm during which they have to stop first at the island of Hven and then, for one day and two nights, at the island of Saltholm near Copenhagen because of fog and bad weather. Arriving at Hammerhus castle on Bornholm, the archbishop´s men at the castle are shocked to see Jens Grand so weakened and they even become fearful that he might die soon. When king Erik Menved got word of the news that Jens Grand had escaped, he sent out messages to all ferries on the island of Zealand and occupied them. He also searched for him day and night across woodlands, bogs and thickets, and he punished the gaolers severely, but all was in vain.
[chapter 7]: At shrovetide the following year, the papal legate arrived in Denmark and handed the king the letter from the pope ordering the king to stand trial in Rome together with archbishop Jens Grand. The king answered that he obeyed the pope in these matters and in all other matters as a christian man should do. The legate also wrote to the archbishop who was still at Hammershus castle and also sent him a document from the king granting him safe-passage, and the legate therefore ordered the archbishop to come to Copenhagen. The archbishop, however, was still so weakened from the imprisonment that he was forced to decline as he could not travel. Having regained his health just after Easter, the archbishop now travelled to Copenhagen and met the legate there. Having conferred with the legate, the archbishop travelled on to Lübeck, where he waited for the legate to arrive. But the legate had been held up in Ribe, where he was together with the king. Jens Grand wrote the legate from Lübeck asking him what to do, and the legate replied that the king had refused to reconcile with the archbishop in Denmark, but that he was now preparing to go to Rome to settle affairs there. Receiving this reply, the archbishop thus travelled to Brügge and further on from there to Paris, as he dared not travel via the shortest route to Rome out of fear that the king´s men might intervene there. He had to travel by carts or wagons as he could not ride being still too weakened from the imprisonment.
[chapter 8]: In 1296, Jens Grand arrived to meet with the pope in Anagni and told him about his harsh imprisonment and complained that he would be suffering lifelong from this imprisonment in terms of health. The pope comforted him saying to his cardinals and other bishops and clerics, who were there, that many holy men in heaven had not suffered half as much for God´s sake as he now had. The pope asked Jens Grand to accompany him to Rome. Having been there awhile, king Erik Menved´s chancellor arrived. This man was Martin of Dacia, Danish scholar of theology from Paris, who would act as procuator for the king during the trial. Then follows a decription of the trial. The archbishop complains about being imprisoned for no good reason and being permanently weakened by it, he also complained that all of his earthly belongings as well as the belongings of dean Jacob had been robbed, furthermore he complained that duke Christoffer had broken into the sacristy and taken the documents and treasures of Lund cathedral, he also complained about further thefts of income of Lund archbishopric done by Erik Menved, furthermore he complained that Erik Menved had imprisoned a cleric from Lund while he travelled with a letter from Jens Grand to the archbishop in Sweden, and furthermore he complained that king Erik Menved had broken into the sacristy of Lund cathedral personally and taken many of the letters and privileges belonging to the church, he also complained that the king had beaten up a cathedral canon called Christian and ripped his coat to pieces when Christian had tried to prevent him from taking the documents in the sacristy, furthermore he complained that the king had withheld all cathedral canons all night forcing them to write and seal all letters and documents that Erik Menved wanted them to write while his men were sitting all night in the house of the canons and in the choir of the cathedral emptying several barrels of beer acting as if they had entered an inn. Jens Grand also complained that in the morning the king had threatened to put all canons in irons unless they broke the interdict and celebrated Mass even though the realm had been excommunicated by a papal messenger whom Erik Menved had even had murdered in secrecy so that no one knew what had become of him. Furthermore, Jens Grand also complained that the king had taken all the belongings of Hans Rodis, canon of Copenhagen, because he had helped Jens Grand escape from prison. Finally he also complained that Erik Menved had comfiscated valuables from a canon in Lund called Peder because he had travelled to the arcbishop in Rome, and the king had also taken money from another official as well as confiscated the tithes of Lund archbishopric and apprehended another canon in Lund called Henrik Blomme and taken all of his belongings too. Amongst many more such complaints these complaints were all presented during the trial. The king´s chancellor excused the king as much as he could, but it was all in vain as the papal legates themselves could testify to its truthfulness. The papal verdict then ordered the king to pay compensation to the archbishop.

1816,The Zhen'gao,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zhen’gao 真誥 [Declaration of the Perfected] is an essential work of the Shangqing (上清 Upper Clarity) scriptures that was compiled and collated by an elite Daoist scholar Tao Hongjing 陶弘景 (456–536 CE). The main body of the Zhen’gao is Yang Xi’s 楊羲 (330–73 CE) manuscripts of the revelation instructed by a group of Perfected (zhenren 真人), a kind of celestial beings that were conceived as situated in the higher rank than the previous known Transcendent (xianren仙人) in the Shangqing scriptures. Yang Xi was a well-trained spirit medium who worked for his patrons Xu Mi 許謐 (303-ca.373) and Xu’s two sons, Xu Lian 許聯 (328-404) and Xu Hui 許翽 (341-ca.370). During 365-369, Yang Xi received a great number of revelations from his Perfected in Mount Mao. The contents of the revelations are diverse that include descriptions of the celestial world and beings, answers to recipients’ questions, instructions on Daoist practices, recipes for drugs and medicine, prophecies for the fates of people, records of dreams, and even the family matters and disputation. Yang Xi’s revelation also employs various genres of literature, such as poems, biography, conversation, and marvelous stories, to portray figures, narrate tales, and convey Daoist conceptions. Besides revelation, this work also preserves a few letters between Yang Xi and three Xu, as well as writings of other spirit mediums who preceded Yang Xi. However, these manuscripts were scattered or damaged after Xu Mi’s death. The first collection of Yang Xi and three Xus’ autography manuscripts was compiled by Gu Huan 顧歡 (425– ca.479 CE) who titled this collection the Zhenji 眞迹 [Traces of the Perfected]. The Zhenji has lost. But Tao Hongjing re-compiled, reorganized, and commented on those fragmentary manuscripts based on Gu Huan’s version after carefully identifying the authenticity of the calligraphies in the manuscripts. In order to reflect its oral tradition of instruction, Tao Hongjing named this collection the Zhen’gao [Declaration of the Perfected]. The Zhen’gao was divided into seven sections by Tao Hongjing based on the different contents. He also entitled each section with three characters by modeling the format of weft books and the Zhuangzi. The extant version preserved in the Daoist Canon is twenty juan (scroll) along with a preface by Gao Sisun 高似孫 dated 1223. Although Yang Xi claimed through the mouth of his Perfected that the revelation written through his hand in the form of human language was from the celestial realm, these writings quoted a great number of previous Daoist works, classics, contemporary textual sources, and even Buddhist sutra. These quotations provide a rich source for us to explore the intertextuality and the reception of early texts. The Zhen’gao also preserves many historical facts, such as the interpersonal relationship of the Xu family, the connection between the gentry family and the imperial court, and the Daoist genealogy in the Six Dynasties, which offers a special window to investigate the social-historical issues.",365,2023,1999,1464,Liying Xu,2023-06-30 18:58:45.405 +0200,2023-06-30 19:12:02.930 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1817,The holy spring of St. Regisse,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Like many phenomena in Denmark, the holy springs seem to be an intricate mixture of probably pre-christian roots in viking age society, and perhaps before, paired with a heavy dose of medieval traditions from the era of catholicism and finally also the influence of the whole post-medieval era of Lutheran protestantism. However, the phenomenon of holy springs in the medieval era and before have been studied much too little, in Denmark, which is probably due to the massive lack of sufficient source material. It is really only during the Renaissance era and later, i.e. after the Reformation, when we begin to encounter a somewhat comprehensive source material on this phenomenon. As there were hundreds of such holy springs scattered across Denmark, the number of such springs is simply much too great to make an entry on all of them. This entry will thus take a look at one of the most famous and well-known holy springs in Denmark, while hoping that shedding light on this one holy spring will in the end also be a useful reflection of this phenomenon as a whole. The oldest written source mentioning the existence of a holy spring in the Frørup area dates from 1496, and this is probably the oldest written evidence of the existence of the holy spring of St. Regisse. Having actual medieval written evidence of the existence of this holy spring is an unusual luxury compared to most other holy springs in Denmark, something which participates in setting this holy spring apart and making the holy spring of St. Regisse particularly interesting as a case study. Further evidence of the state of this holy spring during the late medieval period can be garnered from a 1994 excavation. Late medieval pottery and coinage as old as the 1400s and 1500s was found here  together with many pieces of medieval bricks and roof tiles. These latter findings were important documentation to back up the information provided by the oldest written source actually describing the place in details. Roughly 40 years after the Reformation, a man called Jacob Madsen became bishop of Odense diocese in Denmark. As part of his job he travelled widely around his diocese and in 1589 he visited the holy spring of St. Regisse and described the place in details in his note book based on what he saw himself and on what he was told by the local people. According to him, St. Regisse was a young woman who had been murdered here on this spot by some magnate, and the spring had apparently appeared here after the murder. At the time of Jacob Madsen, this holy spring was still, apparently, an intensely popular site of pilgrimage attracting people who believed that the water of this holy spring had healing powers. It can also be deduced from his 1589 description that he saw the ruins of a medieval chapel building whose demolition therefore must have been begun already before 1589. The last few ruins of the chapel were removed only in 1914/1915 by a local farmer. Had the chapel building itself been made surplus by the Reformation, when this location had stopped being part of the official church, the water and its supposed healing powers were still extremely sought after by pilgrims, at the time of Jacob Madsen. Jacob Madsen describes an extremely active site of pilgrimage. A second description of the site was provided by a local priest, Bendix Hansen, roughly 3 decades later, in 1623. Bendix also gives the impression of an extremely active pilgrimage site with a footpath leading up to it and people leaving crutches and similar here. The holy spring of St. Regisse actually kept its popularity as a site of pilgrimage, amongst people seeking the powers of the healing water, right up until the late 19th C. The chapel itself seems to have been a late medieval brick building probably dating from roughly the 15th C. Inside the chapel an image of St. Regisse could be seen, according to Bendix Hansen, and mass and sermon used to be held here annually (i.e. before the Reformation). By 1589 the place was also still surrounded by some kind of fence, according to Jacob Madsen. This seems to have been a fence of granite boulders whose last remnants apparently still existed by 1915. The fence was probably a leftover part of the late medieval appearance of the site. A lot of big stones were also found here in the 1994 excavation. While there are no preserved medieval sources leaving any information on the chapel building, it is a possibility that there was some kind of connection between the chapel site and the local village church in Frørup. At least, the local Frørup church is very likely to have benefitted from the pilgrimage somehow. As it is still partially preserved, Frørup church is known to have possessed a so-called christ´s tomb in the middle ages. All things considered, such a piece of late medieval inventory seems very far from being standard inventory across the village churches of late medieval Denmark. While it is very common that Danish village churches were expanded during the late middle ages, the church in Frørup seems to have been expanded quite heavily ending up in a size probably unusually large when compared to many other Danish village churches. It is known that pilgrimage to this site was still taking place by 1878, but that it died out soon after that sometime before 1885. Even after this time, it may still have continued for a while, though, on a smaller and less systematic scale and perhaps in a changed form. Overall this corresponds quite well with the general impression that such pilgrimage to the holy springs across Denmark seems to have died out roughly around 1900. By 1945 and 1965 stories of the pilgrimage to the holy spring of St. Regisse could still be told by some.",1400,1885,2000,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-07-01 14:32:11.651 +0200,2023-08-02 11:39:54.175 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1820,"Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification, Campus Fellowship",43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry about the Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification Campus Fellowship, popularly known as
Isokan (Unification). It is a group interested in unifying the various factional bodies of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Church that got divided in 1929.

The Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification (a.k.a. Unification), now known as the Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification (Campus Fellowship) is a Cherubim and Seraphim church based in the institutions of higher learning in Nigeria and overseas. Its emergence was a result of the divisions that have taken place in the mother churches ever since its beginning and growth from 1925 to 1929. With the different factional bodies, what would have become of students in the higher institutions who are willing to continue to worship in the C&S setting and as members of the C&S? Thus, there was a need to have a C&S church that would serve as a church for any member of the C&S from home to join and worship his/her God. It was this that prompted some students at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) to come together and start a C&S church devoid of factions in the C&S in March 1980. 

With penchant for worship in the C&S way and the help of some leaders of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (C&SMC), Ayo Ni O (late Special Apostle Prophet Elijah O. Akinrele, late Special Apostle Prophet (Dr) Gabriel Olubumi Fakeye, Pastor G.O. Baptist, Prophet Fasua and many more), this group of students came together at the Architecture Building (then, the Central Cafeteria) of the then University of Ife. It was this meeting that gave birth to the church, and present at the meeting were: Wale Adekoya, Michael O. Rufai, John Kayode Coker, Elijah Ajao, Kayode Sodipe, Garuba Ishola, and Olu Oduyoye with some other persons. The inauguration of the Church was done in May 1980. These students in their youthful ages came together with a vision to uniting the church which at large had been derided with many divisions. With the differences that are so obvious amidst their mother churches, their coming into school brought about a transformation into the establishment of a unified Cherubim and Seraphim. These students were not looking forward to being affiliated with any of their mother churches. They were not interested in titles, leadership tussles, polygyny, and so on. Instead of titles and leadership struggles, they employed the use of the President for their leader and brother and sister for the members of the church. One prominent thing worthy of note is that this unification group accepts only students of higher institutions as their members. The name of this group at inception was Cherubim and Seraphim Church Student Fellowship, University of Ife.",1980,2019,1082,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,2023-07-05 13:05:08.251 +0200,2023-10-09 18:29:58.760 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1821,Pre-Pottery Neolithic Gre Fılla,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Gre Fılla, covering an area of 0.5 ha and ca.7-8 in height, is located on the eastern bank of the Ambar stream and is in the south of the modern Ambar village near the Kocaköy district of Diyarbakır province. Salvage excavations at Gre Fılla, carried out within the Ambar Dam Project brought out a Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) settlement, located on the northern border of the alluvial plain formed by the tributaries of the Upper Tigris valley. The main settlement period is the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, presenting a sequence dating to 9300–7500 cal. BC. The Pottery Neolithic period is represented only by potsherds; the architecture seems to have been destroyed by the Late Roman and Medieval periods graves. Salvage excavations conducted in two different areas, the north, and the south operations revealed that the settlement layout in the northern operation is marked by three oval subterranean structures, separated by ca. 9–10 m from each other. Each oval structure is surrounded by quadrangular buildings separated by narrow paths connecting them. The grouping of quadrangular structures around each oval structure left the impression of subgroups, each making use of the subterranean structure in the middle of their residential circle. Likewise, in the southern operation were uncovered another oval structure and several quadrangular buildings. Taking into account the radiocarbon dates and the undisturbed stratigraphic position of the oval and quadrangular buildings, it seems clear that both building plan types had been used simultaneously. The oval buildings are ca. 7.5 × 10 m in dimension, each equipped with four pillars constructed of limestone and mud mortar. The walls, renewed multiple times, were not always fully placed on top of one another, causing the appearance of intertwined walls. Several large rooms were furnished with 1–4 stone bases for wooden posts to support the roof. Some buildings have mud plaster on the walls. Preliminary assessment of faunal and micro-floral remains, though they are still under study, shows that the inhabitants of Gre Fılla consumed primarily sheep, goat, cattle, wild boar, deer, rodents, rabbit and birds and lentils, hackberry, grape, etc in their subsistence economy. So far, a few human remains, some of which were furnished with grave goods, were unearthed. Single-burial was practiced and deceased people were interred mostly under the floor or under and/or next to the walls associated with the structures in a flexed position (hocker). There could not be found any special burial facilities at the site.",-9300,-7500,2002,1477,Özlem EKİNBAŞ CAN,2023-07-05 15:16:48.933 +0200,2023-07-05 15:16:48.933 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1829,Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN),43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry about the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN). It is a group interested in unifying the various factional bodies of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Church that got divided in 1929. From a single entity that it was during the period of 1925 and 1929, the C&S church was able to increase in leaps and bounds. However, the division that crept in between the two leaders (Moses Orimolade Tunolase and Christianah Abiodun Emanuel nee Akinsowon on ownership of the church) brought a halt to the once resplendent movement that has caught the attention of many individuals in the country. While some prominent persons who have the interest of the group at heart decided to wade into the situation and bring about a peaceful resolution, unity seems elusive. As people were interested in bringing together different factional bodies, other factions continued to spring up. 
Nevertheless, the much-anticipated unity started gathering momentum in the early 1980s with the establishment of the Unification Council of Cherubim & Seraphim (also referred to hereafter as “the Unification Council” or simply as “the Council”).  The Council set to work and by 1986 a leader acceptable to all the federating churches emerged in Her Most Eminence Captain (Dr.) Christiana Abiodun Emanuel, who was installed as the Supreme Head (Olori). This Unification Council took off with five mother churches that include: the Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim & Seraphim, The Praying Band of the Sacred Society of Cherubim & Seraphim, Cherubim & Seraphim Society, The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Society, and the Holy Order of Cherubim & Seraphim Church Movement, now known as Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church. Over the years, the Unification Council metamorphosed into “the Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria” (also referred to later as “the Unification Church” or simply as “the Church”) which was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission of the country on 9th September 1999 and has continued to build on the foundation laid by the Council.
It must be noted that despite the founding of this Unification Church, many factional bodies are yet to join in this unification drive. Nevertheless, since the establishment of this unification group, the Cherubim and Seraphim Church as a whole now have a single mouthpiece that can voice the concern of the church at the centre. The group had hitherto achieved greater things being together regardless of being like a confederacy.",1986,2019,1082,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,2023-07-06 12:15:25.243 +0200,2023-10-09 18:49:44.180 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1835,"The Cherubim and Seraphim Church of Zion, Ugbonla",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Cherubim and Seraphim Church of Zion was founded on 16th February 1948 in Ugbonla, Ilaje area on the eastern flank of Yorubaland in southwest Nigeria. It is an offshoot of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C & S) Society, a Christian movement which started as a praying group comprising crowds (people) who thronged the home where Abiodun Akinsowon was resident after she had a mysterious encounter. Abiodun had peeped into the chalice of a religious procession and had gone into a trance for days until Moses Tunolase Orimolade was contacted to help restore her to life. This occurred in 1925 in Lagos, Nigeria. As the society began to meet to pray and fellowship, two brothers of Ilaje origin who had visited Lagos and joined the C & S Society and had become very active members of the group. 


The two brothers (Alfred and Timothy Orogbemi) returned to Ilajeland in 1929 and introduced the C & S Society to their homeland. The society grew steadily till it began experiencing some internal crisis at about 1942. Some of her members had accused the church of its acquiescence with the local authority regarding the practice of twin infanticide sanctioned by the latter at the time. The aggrieved members began to pull out of the society as early as 1945 and had predicted that the church will lose its relevance in Ilajeland if it fails to rise to condemn the practice they considered unacceptable. It is widely believed among the antagonists of the practice that had the founder of the C & S Zion Church failed to pull out of the larger society in their homeland and established a reformed version of the church, the C & S Society in Ilajeland, the church would have lost currency with the people.


While the Holy Apostles community, Ayetoro (the first successful theocratic community in Ilajeland) took on a unique description of the interconnectivity between faith and woks and thus had a successful economic and technological campaign, the C & S church of Zion, Ugbonla founded one year after Ayetoro had a spiritual expansionist outlook. The latter expanded its influence and dominance in the area by successfully galvanising the almost fifty other smaller theocratic settlements which sprang up after it. Saint Elisha Lene Ogunfeyimi, the founder of Ugbonla community laid the foundation for several of the doctrinal guidelines which most of the other theocratic communities in Ilajeland subsequently adopted. Ugbonla boasts of hundreds of branches across three continents of the world. The church has branches in most of the coastal states in Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and in the United States and Great Britain.",1948,2023,2005,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-07-06 22:19:42.909 +0200,2023-09-14 11:11:09.318 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1844,"Monastery of Saint John the Theologian, Patmos",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Patmos, the Greek island of the Dodecanese is reputed the place where Saint John the Apostle (also known as Saint John the Theologian) wrote the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse), and according to the tradition, the Fourth Gospel. Following the donation of the island in 1088 to Hosios Christodoulos of Mount Latros, as well as privileges granted by emperor Alexios I Komnenos, a Monastery dedicated to the “beloved disciple” of Christ was founded on the island. 
The Monastery which is surrounded by high defensive walls is located on a mountain peak above the island’s main harbour. Despite the fact that Patmos until then was uninhabited and waterless, the construction of the fortified complex began immediately after the settlement of the monks. The earliest structures of the Monastery are the domed cross-in-square katholikon (main church) and the Refectory, both integrating early-Christian spolia. The Monastery, which became a popular pilgrimage in the 12th century due to the growing fame of Saint Christodoulos’s relics began to flourish during this period. It also became connected to larger metropolitan centres. This is witnessed by the sophistication of the iconographic program and the style of the monumental decoration of the refectory and the chapel dedicated to Leontios, built in ca. 1185. It was also during the same period that the Refectory was vaulted and repainted, and the esonarthex of the katholikon was built. The exonarthex and the tomb chapel of Saint Christodoulos were also probably built during this period. The two-storeyed arcade on the south side was built in 1698.
The cave located approximately halfway between the main port of Patmos and the old settlement (Chora), is the Cave of the Apocalypse (Spilaion tis Apokalypseos in Greek), where according to tradition Saint John dictated the Book of Revelation and his Gospel to Prochoros, his disciple. The cave emerged later also as a focus of pilgrimage. The fresco in the cave depicting John dictating to Prochoros dates from the late 12th century. 
The Monastery possesses rich archives dating back to the 11th century, while it holds an important collection of manuscripts, metalwork objects, liturgical vestments and icons. Apparently the Monastery owned also its own scriptorium.
The historic centre of the island of Patmos, including the old settlement of Chora, the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian and the Cave of the Apocalypse was inscribed on the List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1999.",1088,2023,2009,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-07-09 16:59:22.461 +0200,2023-07-11 06:10:21.536 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1845,Benedictine Order in Denmark,43,Religious Group (v6),"As far as all the different monastic orders who were present in medieval Denmark are concerned, the Benedictine Order is particularly interesting as it seems to have been the very first monastic order to arrive in Denmark. The exact circumstances regarding when, where and how the order first arrived in Denmark fade into history, but it must have happened during the 11th C. The Benedictine monastery for monks in Odense, also serving as the holy chapter of Odense diocese, is known to have been founded by king Erik I Evergood of Denmark (1095-1103) no later than c. the second half of the 1090´s. The only other monastic order potentially present in Denmark around that time, this early on, was the Augustinians. This order arrived no later than during the early 12th C. According to the tradition of Danish medieval annals from the c. 12/13th C., however, it was the christian viking king Cnut the Great (1018-1035) who was the first to bring monks to Denmark. At his time, Danish vikings had conquered England and Cnut thus served not only as king of Denmark, but also as king of England amongst other areas. Obviously, these annals were written only a very long time after events and any actual proof of this is therefore lacking, but there may be arguments in favor of believing in it. Firstly, it would seem to fit in rather well with knowledge of both Cnut´s reign and of his acts as king of England. Secondly, the Benedictine monastery in Odense does not seem to be the first monastery in Denmark, thus the introduction of monks into Denmark must have happened already before the reign of Erik Evergood. Considering the 11th c. Danish kings before Erik, Cnut seems to be a likely candidate. One thing is that Cnut is believed to have been in active in organizing the early Danish diocesial structure and introducing also the concept of monasteries would thus have been a strong act logically attached to this work. Another thing is that his main successor as long-reigning king of Denmark during the 11th C., king Svend II Estridsøn (1047-1074/76), is known to have to been working intensely on not only reorganizing the Danish diocesial structure, but also on liberating the Danish church from the authority of the archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen by getting papal permission to create an independent Danish archbishopric. This scheme did not succeed during his reign already, but question is whether his attempted plan would have been realistic and feasible at all if not even just a single monastery still existed in Denmark to support the diocesial structure and the available religious expertise present within the Danish church. Monasteries formed a very important part of the medieval church and imagining an independent Danish archbishopric without even just a single existing monastery would hardly be a realistic perspective in 11th C. Europe. This is something that Svend Estridsøn, as king and politician, would most likely have known also. Thus it should probably be believed that the first monasteries and monks, as a concept, were introduced into Denmark no later than during the reign of Svend Estridsøn and it is not unlikely that it could have happened already before that. As for Danish kings before Svend Estridsøn who could have done that, potentially, none other than Cnut the Great seems to be an obvious candidate for such an act. Talking about monasteries and monks in Denmark as early as the time of Cnut the Great and Svend Estridsøn, this would most likely have been Benedictine monks. This early on in Denmark, however, talking about any strong and firmly established monastic structure represented in any large numbers is absolutely unrealistic. Whether it was introduced by Cnut the Great or by Svend Estridsøn later on, at that time we are talking about only a single or a few monasteries at some very well-considered locations. Due to lack of sources on the early Danish monastic structure, it remains unknown which exact Benedictine monastery or monasteries that would have been the oldest one(s) in Denmark, but a few candidates can likely be nominated and the oldest Benedictine monastery in Denmark should probably be found amongst these candidates. Discussing the earliest Danish Augustinian convents thus must be a story for another time and this entry will therefore focus on the Benedictines exclusively.  As the abovementioned Danish annals also indicate, the Benedictine monasteries for nuns should probably be ruled out when considering which Danish monastery that possibly was the very first one in the country. Nunneries were generally introduced a little later than friaries in all the other monastic orders who were present in medieval Denmark, and there is no reason to believe that it would have been any different as regards the Benedictines. Also some of the benedictine monasteries for monks should probably be ruled out from such a discussion, as they seem to have been founded only later on. As far as candidates for identifying the very first Danish monastery are concerned, we are thus talking about identifying Danish Benedictine monasteries where signs can be found to make it seem likely that the monastery might perhaps have it roots of foundation during the 11th C. In addition to Odense there are only a few Danish Benedictine monasteries which seem even just potentially that old. Candidate no. 1 is Veng monastery in Jutland. Written sources on its early history say that it was founded and enriched by unspecified Danish kings well before the 1160´s, but sources are otherwise absent. However, the monastery church is still preserved and this building is clearly both old and early. The most recent investigation suggests that it may have been built as early as the 1080´s or perhaps later than that. However, this does not necessarily mean that the monastery was also founded only then. It seems to have been quite common that Danish monasteries used temporary wooden churches sometimes even for decades until the building of a stone church could be financed. So Veng monastery as an institution may actually have been older than the church building, although the exact age of Veng monastery remains hazy. Part of the explanation for this may be that it was closed already during the 12th C. and incorporated into the Cistercian monastery of Øm. Glenstrup monastery, also in Jutland, should probably be mentioned as candidate no. 2. The preserved monastery church seems likely to suggest that it may have been a quite early institution, although how early exactly is unknown as the early history also of this Benedictine monastery remains hazy due to lack of sources. It was later closed during the 15th C. and incorporated into the monastery of the bridgettines in Mariager. Candidate no. 3 must be the monastery of the benedictine monks in Lund in Scania which seems to have roots in the 11th C. as it was most likely founded between c. 1072/75 and 1089. The town of Lund became the site of the Danish archbishopric from the early 12th C. onwards, and the town thus seems to have become increasingly important already during the second half of the 11th C. which is why such an early monastery right here makes great sense. Candidates no. 4 and 5 are the two monasteries in Ringsted and Slagelse, respectively, both placed on Zealand. Both monasteries were apparently founded sometime between 1074 and 1088. The benedictine monastery in Ringsted evolved to become one of the most important monasteries of medieval Denmark. The monastery in Slagelse, however, is unknown to such an extent that is has been doubted whether it actually ever existed at all. There are, however, rather clear signs that it probably did. Its founding is spoken of directly by the Roskilde Chronicle and this piece of information in here is likely to have been based on the early archives of Roskilde diocese. A preserved medieval manuscript from around 1200, or perhaps from c. the first quarter of the 13th C., containing text by Pliny the Elder, also states that the manuscript was written by an otherwise unknown Danish man called Peter of Slagelse - most likely a monk. At that point in time in Denmark writing expertise at such a level would generally have been attached either to the dioceses and their holy chapters, to the royal court or to the monastic world. The manuscript therefore speaks in favor of the institution in Slagelse probably being an early benedictine monastery which was most likely closed no later than c. mid-13th C. Candidates no. 6, 7, and 8 must be the benedictine monasteries at either Slesvig, Seem, or perhaps Randers -all placed in Jutland. These monasteries become candidates as they all seem likely to have originated as double monasteries for both monks and nuns. This type of benedictine double monasteries, however, generally became obsolete after roughly 1100 or the early 1100s after which new ones were not really founded anymore and the existing ones were gradually dissolved - usually by either the monks or the nuns moving away to another newly established monastery instead. By originating as double monasteries these three institutions all suggest themselves as potentially quite early foundations, even despite the scarcity of sources. In Randers the monastery of the benedictine nuns perhaps originated as a double monastery until the monks moved away to Essenbæk monastery in the 12th C. Benedictine double monasteries are known with a far higher degree of certainty, though, from Slesvig and Seem. The monastery in Slesvig seems most likely to be the best candidate as for naming the oldest monastery in Denmark. It seems to have originated sometime during the 11th C. If it was founded either during the reign of Cnut the Great or perhaps a bit later on around 1050, during the early days of Svend Estridsøn, it would have been situated very near to Hedeby. This location would make great sense as for the placing of such a very early monastery since Hedeby was one the most important towns of viking age Denmark and it thus also was an essential location for the Danish kings of that era. Despite the lack of written sources to support it, Cnut the Great having founded a benedictine monastery here could therefore easily be imagined. Another thing potentially speaking in favor of regarding the benedictines of Slesvig as inhabitants of the oldest monastery in Denmark is the fact that the 13th C. annals from Ryd monastery is the main source mentioning Cnut the Great as the very first to bring monks into Denmark. These annals were based on older source material and when the monastery of the benedictine monks in Slesvig was closed during the late 12th C., it ended up being incorporated into a Cistercian institution which soon evolved to become Ryd monastery. Ryd monastery thus was the successor institution of the benedictine friary in Slesvig and memorial traditions stemming from the predecessor institution could thus very well have seeped onwards through time into the successor institution until finally ending up in their written annals. If this assumption is correct it would speak in favor of the benedictine friary in Slesvig having been founded likely during the reign of Cnut the Great as, in all probability, the oldest monastery in Denmark. The benedictine order remained in Denmark until their monasteries were gradually closed after the Reformation. Their glory days, however, were pretty much over from c. the second half the 12th C. onwards after which other monastic orders took over and carried the banner of monastic fashion instead. From then on, a great number of Danish benedictine monasteries were either incorporated into monasteries of other orders or closed entirely and very few new ones were founded.",1018,1536,2010,1345,Svend Clausen,2023-07-10 16:16:16.425 +0200,2023-08-02 11:49:22.641 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1846,Yogasūtra of Patañjali,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Yogasūtra, commonly referred to in the plural as the Yogasūtras is the pre-eminent text for meditative yoga in the past and is interpreted by many practitioners of Modern Postural Yoga (MPY) to be the sources for all later yoga practice.

This text sets out the eight limbs (anga) of yoga, and one of the most important strands of MPY is called Asthanga (8-limbed) after this list  of elements in the yogasutrasyama (abstinences, the don'ts), niyama (observances, prescriptions, preliminaries, the do's), asana (yoga posture, body position, seat), pranayama (breath control, breath exercise ,mantra), pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from the objects of the senses, isolating the essence of mind/soul), dharana (concentration of the mind, focusing on the nature of the mind), dhyana (meditation welling in the mind) and samadhi (absorption into the mind, the universe, the sense powers).  That said, MPY really only focuses on asana practice, and to some degree pranayama, effectively limiting the so-called eight limbs to only one or two.  The majority of the 195 sutras (verses) are about the nature of the should and the physical world, meditation techniques, a single verse on mantra that is also the single verse referring to a god (the Lord of Yoga), preliminary actions and activities, and a wide range of yoga powers (Siddhis) and herbal manipulations (aushadhi).  

This text was composed at the beginning of the common era drawing from earlier writing in the Upanishads and Vedas, considered Hindu, and the epic Mahabharata, containing a wide range of discourse on yoga.  It also draws from varied early Mahayana Buddhist sources.  The Bhagavad Gita, from the Mahabharata, is stated to be the greatest discourse on yoga, but it describes at least eight types of yoga, and only certain sections resemble what is found in the Yogasutras of Patanjali.  The general religious philosophical background should be interpreted according to the ancient philosophical school called Samkhya.  While this text is claimed to be inherently hindu, these days, there are many threads of influence and there are few characteristics of Hinduism today: no Hindu pantheon, no temples, no bhakti.

195 verses or sutra make up the texts.  The sutras are pithy and require quite a bit of interpretation to make meaning from the verses.  Its first statement on yoga states: yogascittavrittinirodha, ""yoga is the cessation of the turnings of the mind"", which has been interpreted and translated in remarkably varied and diverse ways..  The yoga sutras are usually encountered with a commentary that explains the grammar, provides additional arguments, and defines the terms in each verse.  There are many commentaries, but arguably there are 5-10 that are ubiquitous.  One of the first commentaries is by a man named Vyasa (who shares his name with a Vedic seer) though Vyasa could have been Patanjali himself, and this commentary was relatively soon after the yoga sutras were first composed.  The yogasutras together with Vyasa's commentary is titles the Yogasutrabhasya, often just referred to as the Bhasya. Here I am only addressing the 195 verses of the Yogasutra, and I will try to avoid adding too much interpretation from the commentaries, all of which should be studied as unique voice in a tradition of interpreting these important verses.

But what is yoga?  Yoga is a tradition of experiments to perfect the mind and body.  However, the definition of experiments, perfection, mind, and body will determine the those yoga practices and ideas.",-100,300,690,464,Aaron Michael Ullrey,2023-07-10 19:37:27.030 +0200,2023-07-10 21:16:34.063 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1847,Arthaśāstra,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A wide-spanning treatise (sastra) on prosperity or rule (artha).  This text has been labelled non-religious because it is not revealed scripture (sauté) and because it treats ""realpolitick"", economics, statecraft, and war.  That said, the text also describes early practices of yogis and magicians (yogamantravid) who, intriguingly, were often employed as spies.  Throughout the Arthasastra the real world actions were connected also with herbology and magic and portents; in this way there is not a clear distinction between religious and nonreligious.  

The text is supposedly based on a Mauryan emperor, and its start and recensions are found from 200 BCE-200 CE.  This text shows the political world and background that would have informed composition of the epic Mahabharata and Ramayana.  This text sets out a system of go ernment in which various kingdoms interact, leading to a notion that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, so a ruler must activate relationships with the next neighbor kingdom against the immediate kingdoms.  Overall this is a book about the running of a kingdom and maintaining relationships with rival kingdoms, the audience should be considered kings and their counselors.

This text describes the work of mines and trade, extensively explaining a sort of ""ideal"" political world.  That said, the text is more often compared to Machaivelli's The Prince rather Thant Palto's The Republic.  A ruler is to be devisions and employs spies (often yogis), to consult royal magicians and military advisors (purohita), to interpret portents, and to engage magical as will as physical warfare.

Traditionally there are four aims of life, purusharth: sex (kama), business (artha), dharma (religious practice), and moksha (liberation).  Artha here should be considered rule, money, trade, prestige, and economics.  सुखस्य मूलं धर्मः । धर्मस्य मूलं अर्थः । अर्थस्य मूलं राज्यं । राज्यस्य मूलं इन्द्रिय जयः । इन्द्रियाजयस्य मूलं विनयः । विनयस्य मूलं वृद्धोपसेवा॥ ""Dharma is the root of happiness.  Artha is the root of Dharma.  Kingship/Power is the root of Artha.  And kingship/power is rooted in self-governance (indriya), and truly regulated behavior is rooted in self-governance.  Well-regulated behavior is based on serving the the elderly elders (vriddha).

There is an extensive discussion of bureaucracy in the kingdom that predates usual south asian beaurocratic ideas rooted in Persian culture.

Kangle divides his treatments of the Arthasastra into explorations of the state, society and social life, state economy, state administration, law and justice, internal security, defense, relationships with rival kingdoms.   The fifteen books are divided so the first five regard tantra, here meaning internal administration of the state (ganatantra is the modern word for the Indian republic), the next eight deal with āvāpa, here meaning neighboring states, and the last two are miscellaneous, consisting of ""secret practices"" that include a wide range of nasty processes from magic to biowarfare to counter magic against malicious spell craft.  Further esoteric practices are general spellfcraft not just for warfare but for courtly life including erotic materials magical domination, invisible spells.  The final chapter is a brief description of ""sciences"" that are sort of vague principles to be applied to earlier topics, some of these principles are cross referenced to earlier descriptions in the text.",-300,200,2011,464,Aaron Michael Ullrey,2023-07-10 22:43:21.834 +0200,2023-07-12 17:38:54.353 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1848,"Jagannath Temple of Puri, Odisha (Orissa), India",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Jagannath means ""Lord of the World"", from which the British derived the word juggernaut describing an out of control truck, and he is the most prominent deity in Odisha, with his most important temple in the beach-side town of Puri.  Jagganath is worshipped in the form of three (sometimes four) large wooden duties, and his main images are brought out of his temple once a year, placed upon large ornate chariots, worshipped variously, and then the chariots are pulled through the streets so that the deity(deities) might ""vacation"", residing in a nearby temple to Gundicha, a goddess, and this temple is known as his ""summer home"" or his ""garden home"" where Jagannath lives for nine days every year.  This procession of the god is called his rath yatra ""chariot pilgrimage"".  

Jagannath is a sort of trinity formed from the Lord himself, his brother Balabhadra, and his sister Subhadra, sometimes accompanied by a smaller image called Sudarshana.  These roughly correspond to mythical figures associated with Krishna.  That said, scholars have established that this cult likely started with a single Shaiva deities (maybe an Ekapada Bhairava), then that deity became Narasimha (the man-lion) and he was paired with his wife Laksmi, over time this admittedly tantric pair that is widely worshipped in South East Central India was made into a Vaishnava, the Lord of the World, though even the final element, Natha, suggest Shaivism.  Jagannath was then associated with Krishna, Laksmi was turned into Subadra, and a third figure Balabadra was added to create family scene.  The fourth figure Sudarshana may connect to Krishnas weapon.  In this way the local regional god Jagannatha was steadily shifted from a tribal and Shaiva orientation to a wider, even trans local Vaishnava orientation.  Though Bhakta worshippers may argue that Jagannath is Krishna or an incarnation of Vishnu, the people of Orissa see Jagannath as an independent and majestic deity.  I translate a common phrase there, ""We are all safe/prosperous in Jagannath's kingdom"".  Jagannath is seen to pervade the town and the region.

The Rath Yatra is a huge yearly event, setting records each year for pilgrims and spiritual/religious tourists that cause the relatively small city's population to swell, recent years have had over one million (10 lakhs) of visitors.  Notably, the city has  a huge road from the main temple to the Gundicha temple, and this road is the path on which the chariots are pulled.  When the rath yatra is not in session, these wide roads are mostly empty, and most of the rest of the city roads stretch from this main ""road"", which is the size of a small airport.

The Jagannath temple itself is the most prominent building in the town.  The temple complex has extensive structures in addition to the main temple to the deities.  The temple has a twenty foot wall around the complex, and entrance is barred for non-hinds.  The only time non-hinduss can see deities is  the rath yatra.  The temple processes a wide range of worship offerings throughout the day, and the remains from these offerings are distributed as prasad.

The deity Jagannath and his triad are not limited to this main temple but can be found throughout India, especially where folks from Orissa have settled.  Various temples in the United States display small-scale versions of the trinity, and many of them perform a truncated rath yatra around the temple spaces yearly.",1200,2018,673,464,Aaron Michael Ullrey,2023-07-11 17:32:03.500 +0200,2023-07-11 22:11:47.290 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1852,The Communion Letters by Whitley and Anne Strieber,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Whitley Stieber is the world's most famous alien abductee.  In 1987 he published Communion, which was later adapted into a movie, and it was a best seller.  In Communion, Strieber describes his abduction from an upstate New York cabin and his encounters with varied non-human beings in another location, possibly a spaceship, a UFO.  Strieber has been alternately lauded as a brave witness to a magnificent hoaxer, but his entire career was changed, mostly for the worst, by this book, and he has never again received the time of sales and success he enjoyed before publishing Communion.  As a result of the vast sales, movie adaptions, TV and public appearance, Strieber began to receive letters from around the world, but mostly from the United States, in which average folk describe their own encounters with non-human visitors, UFO events, and the incredible overlaps with other paranormal events.......the whole mash of this is now simply referred to as ""The Phenomenon"".  The Communion Letters were published in 1997, though they have gone out of print.  The book is regularly invoked in UFOlogical and experiencer circles.

Strieber's wife Anne began to read the innumerable letters they received.  She began categorizing them.  And she came to the incredible conclusion that the phenomenon has something to do with the dead.  A surprising number of abductees and experiencers also describe encountering spirits of the dead, whom they knew when alive.  The categories and organization of the Communion Letters presents a wide sample of the letters that are quite representative.  There are no facsimiles of the hand written letters, however, in 2020s the physical letters, saved by the Striebers, were donated to the Archives of the Impossible at Rice University. 

The experiencers by and large describe positive encounters.  Those who describe painful or dangerous encounters will also describe repeated experiences that become less distressing.  The letters absolutely show that the experiences are stressful and challenge the worldviews of the experiencers.  Further detailed analysis can be found in John Macks’ Passport to the Cosmos (1999).  The phenomenon is a new and evolving religious movement.

At the archives I have read through many of the letters.....their handwriting is various and diverse, included are a range of artistic depictions of visitors and crafts, and the voices are remarkably fresh and diverse.  It seems unlikely that the letters published in the Communion Letters are a fake or concoctions by the Striebers’, as they have been accused, for I have also seen some of the letters in the book in their physical versions which have been carefully typed up without noticeable changes.  

Chapters are clustered around varied topics and each present roughly twenty letters of varied length: childhood, abduction, encounters, journeys, group encounters, the nine knocks, sexual encounters, and the dead.  The writers are generally protestant Christians, but many of the letters nuance religious viewpoints based on the experiences.  One letter describes an encounter in bed (they are often in bed at night) in which the experiencer asks the visitor if they are angels, and the visitor replies ""yes, but no like you think"".

Recent scholarship accepts the overlap of historical mystic experiences, visions, encounters with deities and saints with the phenomenon.  In fact, “the phenomenon” should not be interpreted as being about material aliens, and many encounters read just like scriptures describing encounters with angels and sky beings.  Another interesting problem is the general weirdness and surreal elements of the encounters, but these parallels descriptions of mystic events throughout history.  The phenomenon is a contemporary encounter with the sacred that harnesses our modern condition with the universal encounters with the ethereal.  Following Anne Taves, the paranormal is the building block of religious experiences and religious innovations, and we are seeing not only a mass and diffuse UFO religion about these encounters but also specific UFO religions or UFO cults.

Therefore, The Communion Letters should be viewed as a report on religious experiences.  Also, the text can be seen as a sort of bible for experiencers that use these letters to interpret their experiences.  Furthermore, this landmark publication has shaped later discourse about UFOs in media, fiction, and the news.


Streiter eases toward religious interpretation, but he is not completely explicit in his language.  He states that the visitors come from somewhere and come to those people that the say represent a brightness, and they come to create experiences.  Those experiences are undeniably stressful.  Some are sexual, but according to the letters, most are not.  In fact, the phenomenon and its related experiences consistently cause the experiencers to see themselves in a new way; the experiences are transformative.  So much of this tracks with the world history of mysticism.",1987,1997,2012,464,Aaron Michael Ullrey,2023-07-12 00:25:59.367 +0200,2023-08-25 18:05:24.891 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1855,Atra-Hasīs,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Epic of Atra-Hasīs is an Old Babylonian poem that narrates the story of the man who survived the Flood. The best-preserved edition of the text known by the ancient Mesopotamians as enūma ilū awēlum (“When the Gods Were Man”) is dated to the reign of Ammi-Ṣaduqa of Babylon (c. 1702-1682 BCE), as evidenced by the colophon, which also preserves the name of the scribe responsible for the edition, Kasaq-Aya (or Nūr-Aya). 
Divided into three tablets, each with eight columns of about fifty-five lines, the composition recounts two different stories, the first of which refers to the deities and the creation of humanity to free them from the burden of work, the second to the near-destruction of the human race by the Flood. Despite divine’s intentions, the creation of the human being led to its uncontrolled reproduction and the consequent noise that disturbed the celestial sphere. The head of the pantheon, god Enlil, thus decided to convene a “war council” and after sending several afflictions to decrease the number of humans, he finally decided to send the Flood to wipe out humanity. Nevertheless, using his powers, god Enki instructed an “extraordinary wise” man (meaning of the name Atra-Hasīs in Akkadian) to build a vessel and save humankind from destruction. As a consequence of his actions, Atra-Hasīs was granted immortality, and the deities took a series of measures in order to prevent overpopulation.
Besides the Old Babylonian tablets from Sippar, other Middle and Late Babylonian fragments of the composition were exhumed at Babylon, Nippur, Ugarit, and Sippar. Plus, a Late Assyrian edition was recovered from Ashurbanipal’s (c. 668-627 BCE) library in Nineveh. 
Furthermore, although Atra-Hasīs is the best-known poetic text related to the Flood, additional testimonies of the same story have been found in ancient Mesopotamia. In Sumerian written evidence from roughly the same period as the earlier copies of Atra-Hasīs, the Deluge hero bears the name Ziusudra (i.e. the one who lived a “life of long days”). Accordingly, in the Flood story preserved on tablet XI of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the survivor of the Flood is known as Uta-napištim, meaning “the one who found life”.",-1700,-600,1631,1470,Maria de Fátima Rosa,2023-07-13 17:27:27.453 +0200,2023-07-21 13:23:57.554 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1858,Christianity in Alexandria: From Origen to Athanasius,43,Religious Group (v6),"The tradition of the Orthodox Church attributes the foundation of the Church of Alexandria to Mark, the author of the Gospel. Christianity, however, probably entered Alexandria through its large Jewish community. Clear evidence of an organized Alexandrian church appears around 180 CE, although its origins must be much earlier, with a bishop and twelve presbyters. Public preaching was hardly possible where Christianity was not a legal religion, and a key to Christian expansion lay in its teachers, resembling those of a philosophical school. The Catechetical school of Alexandria not only prepared enquirers for baptism, but also presented Christianity in terms of the Greek intellectual tradition. Successive leaders of the school were Pantaenus, a converted Stoic philosopher, Clement, also a converted philosopher, of Athenian origin, and Origen, born of Christian parents around 185, who studied under Ammonius Saccas. 
In Alexandria, during the period under investigation, Christianity became quite different in the Catechetical School of the city. Clement saw philosophy as part of a divine educational process to prepare humanity for Christianity and the Christian life as a school of perfection. He accepted the Apostolic traditions, but he wished to show that they possessed a far deeper meaning than they could possibly have possessed among the immediate followers of Christ. Clement was convinced that this new religion, Christianity, if properly understood, was worthy of being accepted by the most enlightened minds. He claimed the most perfect freedom of interpretation and speculation. By applying the same allegorical interpretation which Philo had used in interpreting the Old Testament, to the New, Clement convinced himself and managed to convince others that there was no opposition between philosophy and religion. What Clement had most at heart was not the letter but the spirit, not the historical events, but their deeper meaning in universal history. Origen was the most prodigious scholar of early Christianity. He introduced new forms of learned activity such as textual criticism and systematic theology, extending others such as the biblical commentary, and engaging with the whole range of Greek thought and science. Like Clement he drew on the Platonism already used by the Alexandrian Jewish scholar Philo to present biblical teaching, and, like Philo, used allegorical exegesis of the Old Testament, maintaining the link between Christianity and Israel.
Up to 313, Alexandrian Christianity suffered periodic violence, sometimes severe, from the Roman state. However, with the toleration of Christianity in 313, the first major theological controversy arose. The Alexandrian presbyter Arius posited a theory of the divine “sonship” which could be interpreted as making Jesus Christ a sort of demigod. Denounced by his bishop, Alexander, Arius found support elsewhere in the Greek world. The creed of the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) established the position generally regarded as orthodox, which was elaborated by the Alexandrian theologian and future bishop Athanasius (295-373). Both sides could claim to be drawing on Origen’s legacy. Alexandrian theology continued to focus on the full divinity of Christ, and on the union of the divine and human in Christ, an emphasis later visible when a majority in the Egyptian church adopted a Monophysite form of theology.",185,373,2015,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-07-15 17:25:54.881 +0200,2023-07-29 10:07:58.537 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1867,Kuumbi Cave,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Kuumbi Cave is a karst limestone cavern on the southeast coast of the island of Unguja (Zanzibar). It is sacred to the local community as a spirit (""shetani"") is considered to inhabit the site. Like all caves in Zanzibar with a freshwater source, Kuumbi Cave has a spirit associated with it. The spirit is often associated with pythons and is venerated by the local community.

The landscape around Kuumbi Cave is sacred as well. The cave is located in an  East African Coastal Forest, an ecosystem which has disappeared from most of the island except around sacred caves and in national parks. The forest around Kuumbi Cave has been preserved because of religious strictures against cutting wood there.

The local mganga (healer) conducts ceremonies at Kuumbi and other sacred caves. These rituals are secret for the most part and are conducted privately by the mganga, but what is known is that cloth and incense are used and offerings of food and drink are made to the spirit. There is also a tradition of tying strips of cloth to a wooden framework within the cave as offerings to the shetani. This latter practice is performed by lay visitors to the cave (i.e. not mganga), especially by students praying for good scores on their exams.

The sacred practices associated with caves like Kuumbi are considered part of the intangible heritage of Zanzibar, but they are increasingly under threat from the tourist industry which seeks to monetize the caves by showing them to tourists and allowing them to swim in their sacred waters. Purchasers of caves often bar mgangas and others from performing rituals in the caves.

Archaeologists have excavated Kuumbi Cave since the early 2000s, and have discovered evidence of human occupation of the cave dating to at least as far back at 17,000 years ago. However, the date of the origin of the sacred nature of the cave remains uncertain. The cave was occupied by hunter gatherers until the 20th century, when the cave was abandoned in favor of the nearby settlements of Jambiani and Makunduchi. 

There are stories associated with the most recent occupation of the cave by hunter gatherers. The first says that the cave was used by two lovers for their tryst. The water in the cave was discovered by accident when, post-coitus, the woman threw a stone to the back of the cave and heard a splash. The other story says that the cave was discovered by hunters when an antelope they were chasing with their dogs ran into the cave, which was at the time hidden behind vegetation. Archaeological evidence suggests that the hunter gatherers of Kuumbi were exploiting a broad range of fauna, including those no longer present on the island. 

While no longer the site of a living population, the cave remains sacred to people near and far.",1900,2023,2016,1375,Akshay Sarathi,2023-07-16 21:35:19.708 +0200,2023-08-23 17:32:42.891 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1868,Yuan Dao bian,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The ""Yuan Dao bian"" 原道辨 (Dispute over the ""Origin of the Way"") is a short essay composed by Song Emperor Xiaozong (r. 1162–1189) in 1178 or 1179. It challenges Han Yu's 韓愈 (768–824) ""Yuan Dao"" (Origin of the Way), an authoritative Confucian text at that time, and disagrees with Han's claim that Confucianism is incompatible with and superior to Daoism and Buddhism. Alternatively, the ""Yuan Dao bian"" argues that the Three Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism derive from one origin but become compartmentalized due to their different functions. Xiaozong summarizes the capacities of the Three Teachings in one statement ""Cultivate the mind with Buddhism, nourish the body with Daoism, and govern the world with Confucianism"" 以佛修心以道養生以儒治世. The ""Yuan Dao bian"" resulted from Xiaozong's intellectual interest in Linji 臨濟 Chan Buddhism. In the second half of the twelfth century, Linji masters, especially Dahui Zonggao 大慧宗杲 (1089–1163), propagated among political elites the idea that the Three Teachings derived from one origin. Xiaozong incorporated this view into his essay and thus approved the Buddhist way of explaining the relationship among the Three Teachings. However, Xiaozong went further to argue that none of the concepts in the Three Teachings could completely represent the ultimate Dao because they were names that sages were forced to use when they established their teachings. In this regard, Xiaozong viewed the Dao as an abstract and universal truth that any language would fail to explain, and the Three Teachings as imperfect but necessary instruments of the Dao. Committed Confucian literati reacted strongly to the ""Yuan Dao bian."" Soon after Xiaozong wrote the essay, Shi Hao 史浩 (1106–1194), then Court Lecturer, advised the emperor to moderate his wording and show respect to the renowned Confucian Han Yu. In 1188, Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200), then leader of the Daoxue (Learning of the Way) Confucian fellowship, complained to Xiaozong that the essay ranked Confucianism the lowest and argued that his Daoxue Confucian program would be sufficient for the emperor to manage the mind, the body, and the world. There are two extant versions of the ""Yuan Dao bian,"" one preserved in Shi Hao's collected works and the other in the Linji Buddhist monk Zhongwen Xiaoying's 仲溫曉瑩 (c. 1120–?) Yunwo jitan 雲臥紀譚 (Records and Discussions from Reclining on Clouds). The two versions are mostly the same except for the endings. The ending in Shi's version criticizes Han Yu for overemphasizing differences among the Three Teachings. The ending in Xiaoying's version implies that Xiaozong is a sage who can homogenize (tong 同) the Three Teachings. The Buddhist ending circulated under Xiaozong's reign demonstrates that Xiaozong attempted to create his own religion, in which he was both the political and the religious leader. The ""Yuan Dao bian"" had significant impacts on later discussions about the Three Teachings and was among the predecessors of the notion of ""Uniting the Three Teachings into One"" (Sanjiao heyi 三教合一).",1178,1179,1840,1473,Jiangnan Li,2023-07-18 01:03:01.306 +0200,2023-07-25 09:20:09.108 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1869,IFA RELIGIOUS GROUP IN ILE- IFE,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ife is indeed a place of great cultural and religious significance among the Yoruba people in Nigeria. It holds a unique position in Yoruba history and traditions. Ife has a relatively small population of approximately 49,000 people. The Ooni of Ife, often regarded as the spiritual leader of all Yoruba people, is a figure of immense importance. The Ooni wields significant influence over both the historical and contemporary affairs of the Yoruba people. This leadership role is not just symbolic but carries practical importance in various aspects of Yoruba culture and traditions. Ife is deeply rooted in Yoruba religious traditions. The Yoruba people practice a form of traditional religion that involves the worship of various deities (orisha) and ancestral spirits. These deities play a vital role in Yoruba religious practices. Some of the prominent deities with strong connections to Ife include Oduduwa, Obatala, Yemonja, Aje, Ogun, and Ifa. Orunmila, the head of the Ifa cult, is particularly revered for his special gift of spiritual wisdom and knowledge, as well as for initiating Ifa divination, which is a central aspect of  Ife religious practices. Agriculture, particularly farming, is a crucial economic activity in Ife. The  Ife people  rely on farming for sustenance, trade, and medicinal purposes. Agriculture not only provides food but also serves as a source of traditional medicine, underlining its importance in the community's survival and well-being. The history of Ife is primarily passed down through oral traditions. While it may not be documented in written texts like religious scriptures, these oral histories are valuable sources of information about the city's cultural and historical significance. Oral traditions are a common way of preserving history and cultural knowledge among many African societies. The two notable kings in the history of Ife are Adesoji Aderemi and Okunade Sijuwade. They made significant contributions to the development of Ife.  Adesoji Aderemi, as the first indigenous governor of Western Nigeria, focused on promoting indigenous religion and cultural practices. Okunade Sijuwade continued to support social and religious activities in Ife, gaining international attention and recognition. Ife's rich cultural heritage, religious traditions, and historical importance make it a unique and vital city within Nigeria and the broader Yoruba culture. The Ifa group and the worship of Yoruba deities are integral components of the city's cultural and religious tapestry, reflecting the deep-rooted traditions and spirituality of the  Ife people. This entry will therefore look at the religious tradition of the Ifa group of ife  people.",1930,2015,2017,1460,olusegun oladosu,2023-07-18 15:52:40.382 +0200,2023-10-29 18:28:11.309 +0100,Personal Expertise
1871,Inana's descent to the nether world,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"""Inana's descent to the nether world” is a Sumerian literary composition focused on describing this goddess' plan to conquer the realm of the dead, ruled by her divine sister, Ereškigal, as well as the results of such attack.
To reconstruct these 412 lines of composition, modern scholars have used more than fifty cuneiform fragments and tablets, from different space-temporal contexts. Though most of the surviving copies, identified at Ur and Nippur, are dated to the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE, the origins of this story appear rooted in the preceding millennium. 
The composition can be divided into five main sections: a) Inana’s decision and preparations for the journey and the consequent arrival at the first gate of  the Netherworld (lines 1-73); b) the goddess' interaction with Neti, the guardian of the Netherworld, and her subsequent passage through its seven gates (lines 74-163); c) the confrontation between Inana and Ereškigal and her captivity (lines 164-172); d) the process for rescuing Inana and the attempts to find her a substitute (lines 173-367); e) the imprisonment of Dumuzi, Inana’s traditional divine lover, and the ultimate decision of having his sister, Geštinanna, taking turns with him in the Netherworld as Inana’s substitutes. Sladek (1974:51) identified how this last section integrated an original independent story, focused on Dumuzi’s death and known traditionally as “Dumuzi’s Dream”, which appears in circa seventy tablets.
This composition has a profound literary richness, dealing with several different themes, such as the limits and rules of cosmic domains; limits to divine powers; conceptions on death and funerary practices; and of course, the nature and roles of goddess Inana.
Despite the deep parallelisms with the storyline of the Akkadian composition known as “Ištar's Descent to the Netherworld”, a closer look allows to observe a certain autonomy between both texts, which is visible in the goals, tone, and literary mechanisms of each one. For instance, it should be stressed how the Sumerian composition is more focused on Inana's actions and individual consequences, while the Akkadian text boosts this ""personal"" dimension into a cosmic one. In fact, by describing how Ištar's imprisonment impacted the fertility on both heavenly and earthly domains, the tone of the Akkadian text is much more intense (Katz 2003:256-258; Almeida 2015: 268-270). Accordingly, each introductory section expresses a thematic shift, which is deepened as the events are unfolded in the following segments.",-1900,-1600,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,2023-07-21 12:29:55.536 +0200,2024-03-28 19:23:22.257 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1872,"The Holy Apostles Community, Ayetoro",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Holy Apostles Community, Ayetoro was founded in January 1947. The community came into existence after an irreconcilable difference broke between the Holy Apostles and the traditional institution in Ilajeland. The former had strongly opposed and publicly condemned the traditional practice of twin infanticide sanctioned by the latter in their homeland at the time. Prior to these confrontations, members of the Ayetoro community had identified as followers of the Cherubim and Seraphim Society which was introduced to Ilajeland in 1929. They had accused the leadership of the Cherubim and Seraphim in Ilajeland of acquiescence with the traditional practice and warned that the society would lose its relevance if it failed to speak up against the practice. Several acts of civil disobedience were reported against the prophets and members of the group which would later adopt the name: Holy Apostles.
 

Some of them were fined by the local authority while others served jail terms over charges preferred against them by the traditional institution which they contended with. But these punitive measures were not able to break their ranks until they organised themselves and began to migrate to uninhabited islands and swamps which belonged to families of notable personalities among them. Their first attempt at establishing a theocratic community was made in 1945. The primary aim of the group was to organise themselves and establish a new community which would be free from the influence and control of the local authority in their homeland. This attempt failed owing to the report made against the Holy Apostles by the traditional institution they opposed. Upon the receipt of the report, the District Officer at the Okitipupa Divisional Office of the Colonial Administration came down to the newly founded community to investigate the report. A member of the community attempted to harm the District Officer who brought the full weight of the law on the leaders of the newly founded community. When he and others arrested with him were released from custody, he refused to return to the community. This left a leadership gap which had to be filled. There were fears of attacks and mass arrests from the authorities. This informed the new leader’s consultations with the members on the need to relocate to a new site. They therefore migrated to Ayetoro in January 1947. 


In 1948, the Oba (monarch) of Ayetoro introduced communalism to the community. All members relinquished ownership of their personal belongings to the community and a new wave of development was witnessed. Within a decade, Ayetoro had become the first community to have public electricity in the Old Ondo Area. Besides, the community had built a functional technical workshop and college which trained marine engineers and other categories of technicians. They built a primary school and the first secondary school in Ilajeland. They invested heavily in transportation business by building boats which aided the movement of persons, goods and services along the waterways between Lagos in the west and Cameroon in the east. The community built fishing trawlers which launched into the ocean, harvesting varieties of fish which the community sold in markets locally and in Lagos. They built modern houses and constructed solid walkways on stilts. This development aided movement across the entire community and supported the Oba’s car to tour the community. It was a novel invention in Ilajeland. The community’s economic and technological advancement was rapid and well sustained that it soon began to attract the attention of the government and global development bodies. By 1970, Ayetoro abolished communalism and it soon began to witness decay to its economic assets. Today, the only visible traces of the once prosperous community are the relics of the assets it once deployed for economic and technological development. Over the years, Ayetoro has gone through some stages in her spiritual journey. In the past, especially at some point during the period of its massive economic and technological drive it played down on religion. It has again witnessed a revival of its spiritual fervour. The continuous existence of the community is threatened owing to the massive ocean surge which has permanently swept more than half of its original landmass under the Atlantic Ocean.",1947,2023,2063,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-07-22 18:30:39.906 +0200,2023-09-14 11:18:38.039 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1874,"Church of St. John, Trachiniakos",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of St. John in the village of Trachiniakos (just west of Kandanos in the southwest corner of Crete) is a single nave construction with a barrel-vaulted interior and a saddle roof exterior. Dated by a partially preserved dedicatory inscription to 1328-29, the church is located on the left side of a narrow road leading to the vibrant olive groves surrounding the village. 
The church is divided into two bays by a transverse arch with two niches along both the north and south walls. A modern wooden iconostasis divides the sanctuary from the nave. Richly decorated and well preserved, the wall paintings have been ascribed to the work of two painters, one in the style of the Cretan painter Ioannis Pagomenos. 
The half dome of the sanctuary includes the image of the Virgin Platytera above the image of two co-officiating bishops, St. Basil and St. John Chrysostom. The triumphal arch includes the image of the Hospitality of Abraham above the Annunciation. Below both the Angel Gabriel and the virgin are the deacon saints St. Stephen and St. Romanus the Melodist. Bishop saints, including the image of Leo of Catania, line both the northern and southern walls of the sanctuary.
In the nave, the barrel vault is decorated with scenes from the Christological cycle including images of the Baptism of Christ, the Raising of Lazarus and the Helkomenos. The archway, decorated with the prophets David, Daniel, Solomon and Isaiah, is set out from the barrel vault and divides the eastern and western niches on either side. 
The titular saint, St. John the Evangelist, is painted in the eastern niche along the northern wall. Facing towards the altar holding a book, he is framed by a decorative archway. Above him, two medallions bearing representations of a young saint and an angel are likely connected to the symbology of the saint. The western niche on the northern wall includes three military saints, St. Theodore, St. George and St. Dimitrios, all on horseback below the blessing hands of the Archangel Raphael. All three spear dragons at the bottom of the scene. To the west of the niche is the image of the monastic saint St. Onouphrius and next to him the image of St. John the Hermit. 
Likewise, the eastern niche on the southern wall holds a large image of the Archangel Michael wings outstretched. He is flanked to his left by St. Mamas. Above them, three medallions with red and green backgrounds hold the images of an eagle, a lion and an ox representing the three symbols of the evangelists, an unusual addition to Cretan churches of this period. The western niche includes the large image of Saints Constantine and Helena flanked by St. Procopius. They are blessed from above by St. Sophia. Between the eastern and western niche is the image of St. Nikitas portrayed in military garb. West of the niche are the images of two female saints: St. Kyriaki and St. Paraskevi. 
The western wall, albeit damaged, includes the image of the Crucifixion above the dedicatory inscription. The dedicatory inscription states that the church was built in the year 6837 (1328-29) at the expense of three families from the village. The doorway is flanked by four female saints, St. Barbara and St. Marina on the left and two unnamed female saints on the right.",1329,2023,2020,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-07-26 00:09:43.141 +0200,2023-07-26 00:09:43.141 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1880,The Tophet of Carthage,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The tophet was an infant cremation sanctuary at the Punic city of Carthage dedicated to the worship of Ba’al Hammon and his consort Tinnit. The sanctuary was located on the southeast periphery of Carthage and shows signs of continuous use from the city’s foundation in the 8th century BCE to destruction in 146 BCE. The tophet of Carthage belonged to a network of distinct sanctuaries located in towns of the Phoenician diaspora across the central Mediterranean and North Africa. These sanctuaries were distinguished from other contemporary religious spaces by their open-air layouts, location on the peripheries of urban settlements, and assemblage of altars, votive stelae, and cremation urns containing a mix of burnt animal and infant human bones. The sanctuary at Carthage was by far the largest among its contemporaries, with thousands of stelae recovered from the site and an estimated 20,000 urns deposited between 400 - 200 BCE alone. Though the sanctuary’s architectural layout remains a mystery, the site’s six centuries of continuous use suggest its sacred importance for Carthaginians.

Since its discovery in 1921, many scholars have identified the sanctuary with the rites of Carthaginian child sacrifice described by Graeco-Roman authors (Diodorus Siculus XX.14.5-7; Plutarch, De superst. 13.C-D). The moniker “tophet” was originally assigned to the site in reference to the biblical Hebrew name (תֹּוֹפֶת , Tōp̄eṯ) for a “high place” in the valley of Ben-Hinnom where children were made to “pass through fire” (Jeremiah 7:31-2; II Kings 23.10). There is, however, no clear connection between the sanctuary and practices in the Phoenician Levant and some scholars argue that the tales of infant sacrifice are nothing more than anti-Punic polemic describing a simple child necropolis. Nevertheless, others continue to support the possibility of infant sacrifice at the site on the basis of iconographic, osteological, and epigraphic evidence.

Regardless of the reality of sacrifice at the site, the tophet of Carthage remained an influential sacred space after the city’s destruction in 146 BCE. From the 2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE, several “tophet-like” sanctuaries were built in North African towns under Roman rule and dedicated to the worship of Saturn and Juno Caelestis, the Roman deities associated with Punic Ba’al Hammon and Tinnit. These Roman period tophets were modeled on the sanctuary at Carthage and imitated its urn deposits, stelae, and votive inscriptions, but simultaneously adapted to local traditions and elements of Roman religious practice. Many of these tophets were eventually replaced with temples of Saturn, which followed conventions of Roman temple architecture while maintaining the sacred functions of their sites. Even the site of the tophet at Carthage itself may have been restored as a temple to Saturn and Juno Caelestis, though the Roman period archaeologically of the site is still a matter of debate.",-800,-146,2021,1496,Christopher Saladin,2023-07-27 18:27:22.491 +0200,2023-08-01 22:54:20.253 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1882,The Life of Severus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The “Life of Severus” written by Zacharias Scholasticus (or rhetor, or Zacharias bishop of Mytilene) is a work of significant importance for understanding the cultural and spiritual influences, the history of the Monophysite movement during the fifth and sixth centuries, but also of the student environment of Alexandria and Beirut towards the end of the fifth century. Severus is considered as one of the most important Greek theologians of the sixth century and as the main authority on Christology for the Syrian Orthodox tradition. He was born in Sozopolis, in Pisidia, around 459, probably from a pagan family. He begun his studies in Alexandria and then he went to study law at the Law school of Beirut, where he was converted to Christianity, perhaps under the influence of his biographer. He was baptised in 488 at the shrine of Saint Leontius in Tripoli. He became a monk and resided in a monastery near Gaza -a stronghold of Monophysites. When Flavian II was deposed from the patriarchal see of Antioch in 512, Severus was elected as his successor. However, with the death of the emperor Anastasius in 518 and because of the pro-Chalcedonian ecclesiastical policy that Anastasius’s successor, Justin I, adopted, Severus was forced to leave Antioch. He went to Egypt where he spent the rest of his life until his death, in February of 538. In 536 Justin I had his writings, originally written in Greek, condemned. Therefore, most of them survive only in Syriac translations (theological treatises refuting either Chalcedonian polemic or the more extreme anti-Chalcedonians, an extensive polemical work against Julian of Halicarnassus, as well as a small proportion of his vast correspondence). The hundred-page biography of the Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch was prepared sometime after Severus’s accession to the patriarchal throne of Antioch in November 512. It focuses on Severus’s career up to his enthronement, without dealing with the events after his accession. Zacharias’s intention is to defend his close friend and fellow student against rumors that claimed that Severus was a devout pagan during his student years in Alexandria, while he participated and offered sacrifices while studying in Beirut. The “Life” consists of four sections: it begins with a short dialogue between Zacharias and an anonymous person, where the author of the text becomes aware of the slanders against Severus. Next, Zacharias focuses on the early years of Severus’s life, his family background and his rhetorical training in Alexandria, describing the experiences of Severus as a member of a group of Alexandrian “philoponoi”, that is, Christian zealots students like Zacharias, who had close ties to the monophysite monastic community of “Enaton”, near Alexandria. Apart from the facts, however, that describe Severus’s life, what is also quite significant with the text is the fact that it provides us with first-hand information about the student life in Alexandria and Beirut and the conflicts between pagans and Christians and the anti-pagan policy of Emperor Zeno. Zacharias interposes the case of Paralius, a pagan student who was converted to Christianity. Bacause Paralius accused his teacher, Horapollo the Younger, and his circle of sorcery and witchcraft, he was beaten up by his fellow students. Because of that, a series of anti-pagan riots broke out in Alexandria, guided by the Patriarch Peter III Mongus, which led to the looting of the sanctuary of Isis in Menouthis and the burning of pagan cult objects. Shortly after, Emperor Zeno sent delegates to Alexandria to investigate whether the pagan teachers practiced pagan rituals. The result was the ill-treatment and expulsion of prominent pagan (mostly neoplatonic) teachers. After Paralius’s incident, Zacharias takes his readers to Beirut, where he describes Severus’s legal studies. There, Severus participates in a group of zealot Christian students in close contact with monophysite monastic centers in Palestine. Severus provides religious instruction to his fellow students, while he fights paganism in the student community of the city, organizing raids. The final section of the text emphasizes on Severus’s decision to abandon his legal career and retire to a monastery near the town of Maiuma in Gaza.",512,518,2048,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-07-29 15:40:43.481 +0200,2023-09-01 20:52:23.120 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1883,"""Ammonius, On the Creation of the World"" by Zacharias Scholasticus",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"“Ammonius, on the eternity of the world” is a dialogue written by Zacharias Scholasticus (or rhetor, or Zacharias bishop of Mytilene), a native of Gaza who lived between c. 465-536, was a fierce partisan of Monophysitism but ended up as an Orthodox bishop of Mytilene. Zacharias’s dialogue is important, as it provides a vivid and detailed picture of the student environment in 5th century Alexandria, its philosophical schools and the lively debate between pagans and Christians during that period. Nevertheless, the date that Zacharias composed his dialogue remains unknown, since we lack both internal and external testimonies that can provide us with some relatively reliable indications in this regard. It seems, however, that the dialogue “Ammonius” is a work of its author’s maturity: here, Zacharias does not deviate from official Orthodoxy, does not indulge in doctrinal compromises, nor does he allow himself to be misled by heretical tendencies. All this suggests that the dialogue was written after Zacharias had definitively renounced the monophysitical positions of his youth. “Ammonius” in fact records the conversation between two persons identified as ""A"" and ""B"". It begins with a short prologue, the only narrative part written in the first person, where the narrator is identified speaker “A”. While the dialogue between “A” and “B” is not framed by an audience or a third person, the lectures with Ammonius and the iatrosophist Gessius take place in front of an audience, whose reactions are meticulously recorded. The dialogue opens with the unexpected meeting of a Christian (speaker “A”, evidently Zecharias himself) and a disciple of the philosopher Ammonius (speaker “B”, presumably a Christian, who is said to be leaning towards paganism) in Beirut, where the latter has moved from Alexandria to study law. Speaker ""A"" takes the opportunity of the meeting to ask about the philosopher Ammonius, but his mocking and accusatory tone prompts ""B"" to question his interlocutor’s hostility towards the philosopher. This prompts speaker ""A"" to refer to four discourses: three with the philosopher Ammonius himself in Alexandria and one, in the same city, with the iatrosophist Gessius.
The first discourse between the Christian and Ammonius is intense and soon the conversation shifts and takes on more of a confrontation between Christianity and pagan philosophical ideas. Both interlocutors refer to authoritative authors of their tradition, including Plato and Porphyry, while Christian's extensive argumentation ends with the Apostle Paul and Solomon. Ammonius acknowledges the Christian's victory at certain points, and the narrative closes by recording the audience's preference for Christian positions. The second discourse takes place the next day and is instigated by Gessius, one of Ammonius's best students. The scenery however is different: the discussion is taking place at the Museum of Alexandria, ""where poets, orators, and grammarians are wont to display their skill."" Plato is often cited and considered authoritative by both parties. The Christian speaker, who is frequently using passages from “Timaeus” to foster his arguments, argues that the Holy Scripture, St. Basil the Great, the Stoics, and Plato himself agree that the universe will perish. Although Gessius initially appears bewildered and dazzled by the Christian arguments, as the conversation progresses, he recognizes their authority, even if there is no clear admission on his part. The third discourse takes place during Ammonius's lecture on Aristotelian ethics. The debate is intense. Ammonius is struck by the Christian arguments. The final discourse between the Christian and Ammonius, significantly shorter than the previous ones, is motivated by the philosopher, who questions the Christian teaching about the Holy Trinity. Ammonius, however, is soon convinced by the response he receives, causing a joyful reaction to the audience. He then blushes, falls silent and avoids any further conversation. After the four discourses, the discussion between “A” and “B” continues, as the latter is still unconvinced. Here, speaker “A” develops an extensive argument using passages from the Scriptures, from the works of Clement of Alexandria, St. Basil the Great, and St. Gregory of Nazianzus.

The three monks had built a small church on the spot where they had found a miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary hanging on a tree, during the period of the reign of emperor Michael IV (1034-1041). During this period Constantine Monomachos was exiled on the island of Lesbos. The three monks who had a divine revelation travelled from Chios to Lesbos in order to announce him that he would soon become emperor. Constantine promised them that in that case, he would built a Monastery on the spot where the icon was found. In 1042 Constantine Monomachos was proclaimed emperor and as promised he built the main church of the Monastery, bringing skilled artisans and an architect from the capital of the empire, Constantinople. He furthermore conferred abundant privileges and lands secured by imperial documents. 
The main church of the Monastery is a small square below a tall segmented dome on an octagonal drum. It also possesses an outer and an inner narthex, as well as a low bema, all of them forming distinct parts of the main structure. In the 16th century, probably around 1512, a new bell tower replaced the original one. In the 19th century in the katholikon were opened windows in order to bring more light to the space. The church suffered great destruction during the Massacre of Chios’ population of 1822 and the earthquake of 1881, which has led to the reconstruction of the dome, large parts of the superstructure and the east, north and south arches.
Between 1045 and 1055 the church was decorated with mosaics of high quality. In the esonarthex are depicted scenes from the Life of Christ (Raising of Lazarus, Entry into Jerusalem, Foot-washing, Betrayal), Virgin Mary and Martyrs (Evgenios, Afxentios, Efstratios, Sergios, Theodoros Stratilatis, Bacchos, Orestis and Mardarios) in the blind dome of the esonarthex. In the main part of the church are depicted: Cherubims and Seraphims, and two of the four Evangelists (John and Mark) in the pendentives of the dome; the orant Virgin (semi-dome of the apse), Archangels Michael (prothesis) and Gabriel (diakonikon) in the bema; Great Feasts (Baptism, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Deposition, Descent into Hades/Anastasis) in the conchs of the dome. It is believed that king Salomon depicted in the scene of the Anastasis is a portrait of emperor Constantine Monomachos. The mosaic decoration of Nea Moni is one of the three ensembles of the middle byzantine period, still preserved in Greece, together with Hosios Loukas in Boeotia and the Monastery of Daphni in Attica. The mosaics of the katholikon of Nea Moni were partly destroyed by the earthquake of 1881. 
The south and the north apses, as well as the domes of the exonarthex were later decorated with two different layers of frescoes that were uncovered, during the restoration of the monument. The earlier of them, the Palaeologan layer, dates to the 13th century. The second dates to the 17th century. The floors of all the parts of the church were paved with opus sectile. 
The defensive tower, which was likely used as a library space, the cistern and the refectory date all to the 11th century. Outside the walls of the Monastery are still preserved the funerary chapel dedicated to Saint Loukas –considered also an 11th-century monument–, parts of the aqueduct, as well as various other buildings such as cells, workshops, warehouses etc.
Nea Moni was inscribed on the List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1990.",1042,2023,2023,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-07-29 19:01:50.669 +0200,2023-08-01 22:45:20.535 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1888,Communion By Whitley Strieber,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The groundbreaking and essential work on ""alien"" abduction by Whitley Strieber.  The 1987 best seller was the first major publication by a UFO abductee, though Stieber is careful to state that he does not know who or what the visitors actually are.  He does not explicitly call them aliens.  He remarks in the book and elsewhere that the visitors, in some way, are us.  The book is labelled and marketed as a true story.  If the story of better and barney hill's abduction was the foundation of the abduction narratiive genre, then Communion would be the most important subsequent event.

The plot of the book outlines the events of one-fateful night at Strieber's cabin in upstate New York in 1985.  The author and his family, also several house guests, had gone to be early.  Streiber is awakened and finds himself transported to another location, that may be a space ship.  He encounters several small and squat creatures that he later calls cobalts.  Also, he interacts withe a mantid creature, insect-like and female.  A curious detail is that he also sees a representation or a ghost revenant of an acquaintance long dead.

The creatures perform several ""experiments"" on him, communicating with him telepathically, asking him to stop screaming.  At the culmination of the event, he is prober rectally which also results in ejaculation.

Streiber awakes the next day with few memories, only flashes of the events.  He sees a doctor who notes he has rectal trauma.  As time passes Streiber beings writing a short story called ""Pain"", and the memories begin to return to him.  He contacts Bud Hopkins, a UFO researcher and hypnotist.  After undergoing hypnosis, Streiber is able to fully recall the events.  

The author outlines various paranormal events around the cabin, such as phantom alarms going off, seeing orbs, and other odd events.  He even goes out to the woods looking for the visitors again.

This book documents his initial contact with visitors, but Streiber goes on to write many more books about the visitors.  He eventually posits that the visitors are ""messing with"" humans to provoke stress responses that will advance evolution.  Later books develop a whole history and quasi theology about the visitors.  

The book was wide spread, and one could argue that all abduction narratives from its publication forward are in conversation or even reaction to this true story.  Streiber had thousands upon thousands of people write to him with their own contact experiences,; he and his wife edited and published these as the Communion Letters.

Streiter is also a practitioner of tarot and gurjieff-style meditation, both of which he describes using in later books to continue his contacts with the visitors.  he has outlined the connection of the visitors to the dead and other supernatural events.  In later works he describes meeting a humanoid visitor late at night who reveals a complex message about human life, the state of the planet, the the fate of mankind.  In 2023 he published his most systematic, and theological, description of the visitors in a book called Them.  Prior to that, Contact is a book the reveals the ongoing results of his communion, including revelations about an implant in his brain-eye by which he can communicate with the visitors and draw upon vast troves of wisdom.

The book is a perfect representation of the religious lives of not particularly, traditionally religious people.",1987,1987,1131,464,Aaron Michael Ullrey,2023-08-01 05:21:56.984 +0200,2023-08-08 20:42:26.407 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1896,Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Passport to Magonia: From Folklore to Flying Saucers is Jacques Vallee's seminal text written in 1969, preceding the UFOlogical craze emerging in the 1980s.  The book is referenced continually in academic scholarship on UFO, but among experiencers and UFOlogists, amateur and professional, the book has considerable authority, some treating it as if holy writ.  The word magonia in the title refers to an aerial realm in the clouds from which dangerous sailors in flying ships have emerged.  Magonia is a cloud realm from French medieval literature.  Vallee choses this word carefully, for he argues that UFOs are not in fact extraterrestrial but are in fact multi-dimensional, that they are in fact not from another planet but another dimension and that other dimension is grasped from this one and this planet.  The UFO experiencers and sightings represent a blending of these dimensions, and this dimensional overlap is the source of the paranormal experience.  The paranormal is just as real as anything else; it is not supernatural per se, the paranormal is just different from agreed upon reality.

Jacques Vallée (b. 1939) is a French computer scientist and engineer in addition to being an astronomer and UFOlogist.  He was a pioneer in the early Internet, and his has connected his engineering career with an entrepreneurial one. He is also an award winning novelist. Vallee worked in the US governments Project Blue Book, studying UFOs from military data, in which he was utterly convinced about the reality of these aerial UFOs, though he heartily disagreed with the notion that they are hard, material objects from another planet.

Vallee's main question is when ""the phenomenon""—a word signifying aerial sightings, abductions, and encounters with visitors—first started.  While skeptics argue that the sightings and lore are hoaxes and are manufactured by the press or that the phenomenon the product of psychological operations by the US or other governments.  Vallee dug through archives and reports ranging through time, and he reproduces summaries of his archive finding to present a century of UFO landings (1968:190-359) in 169 pages.  

These summaries prove the case that aerial encounters and landings are described around the world and have been documented around the world long before the window of post-WWII sightings.    The reports come from a full range of subjects, including electrical workers, judges, military officers, and even Aliester Crowley, the19- 20th century occultist.  

These reports vary from air ships (sounding somewhat like blimps) that regularly ""drop anchor"" and are helmed and occupied by strange but humanoid figures, to cigar-shaped things in the sky., to encounters with frogmen and extraterrestrial gnomes and dwarves, to strange explosions, to abdiuction, to classic flying saucers and wheels in the sky.  Patterns emerge in his report.  Vallee argues that these strange incidents can be documented throughout history and represent eruptions of something that we cannot conceive but have represented through time as faeries, air ship, and, now, flying saucers.  

All these are glimpses to another world existing at the same time as ours but occasionally overlapping to create the phenomenon, rejecting the hypothesis the the phenomenon is extraterrestrial in origin.  He argues that UFOs are less material or materialized objects as they are windows to another world, and that other world might also include humans. He writes on page 162 about four aspects of the phenomenon.  Jeffrey Kripal summarizes these ideas:""(1) the behavior of a superior intelligence, whether from the starts or from some other dimension of this plane, would not necessary appear sensible to our own cognitive and sensory capacities; (2) that the puzzle of time and, I assume, the possibility of time-travel, renders  intergalactic or multiple-earth scenarios more, not less, likely; and (3) the subject of  UFOs as a whole suggests ""a myth that could be utilized to serve political or sociological purposes."" (Kripal 2010:167). Vallee never lets loose that this all may be trickery, but that trickery could be by an alien group from another planet or by humans in the future revealing themselves now or that there is an alternate dimension existing right now and spilling into the world.

It is important to note that Vallee makes use of the hard sciences equally with his study of folk lore.  His inspiration is the archival work by Charles Fort depicted in his Book of the Damned (1919) in which Fort records a huge body of paranormal events recorded in news media.  

Considering that space travel has only recently become a technological possibility, these folk elements would not have been conceived as space ships, for the idea of a space ship does not exist.  Rather, Vallee searches through folklore to posit the phenomenon there unde many names, under so many masks of which the aliens from space are only the most recent version.

Vallee starts his preface with a manifesto statement regarding the purpose of the book, which is to inspire folk to see the supernatural as real and to not conflate it with hostile or occult interpretations.  ""This book is an attempt to build a bridge-a tenuous and fragile one-between a fancy and a myth.  It is not a scientific book.  It could be called a philosophical book, if there were a philosophy of nonfacts.  It is not a documentary, unless the dreams of children at play and the cries of women burned alive can be documented.  Yet many lives have changed (security, unnoticeably sometimes, and, indeed, many innocents have been burned alive because of the fancy.  The book is a tribute to all the people who dared preserve a dream?""",1969,1969,2036,464,Aaron Michael Ullrey,2023-08-01 05:45:03.393 +0200,2023-08-25 23:38:37.333 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1897,"The Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe was established on January 2, 1951 by a group predominantly made up of Ilaje men and women who lived or hailed from the Etikan and Aheri axis of Ilajeland. They had previously subscribed to the Cherubim and Seraphim Society which made its way into Ilajeland in 1929 and had continued to pursue their spiritual enlightenment with the Cherubim and Seraphim Church, Ugbonla from February 16, 1948 when that movement became distinct from the erstwhile Cherubim and Seraphim movement in Ilajeland. Worshippers at Ugbonla who travelled from Aheri and Etikan area of Ilajeland often had tortuous journeys to the community, They had to travel in dugout canoes for hours and at times in the rain. Apostle Theophilus Erejuwa Mafo, an associate of Saint Elisha Lene Ogunfeyimi then took it upon himself to establish another Zion community in the fringes of Etikan and Aheri. He moved to an uninhabited land (Zion Pepe) off his natal settlement of Ipepe to begin a new Zion which began to serve the spiritual enlightenment desire of C & S members in that area of Ilajeland. 


The church founded by Saint Mafo took up a hybrid name collapsing the nomenclature of the Episcopal church in his natal settlement with the C & S movement he was introducing there. Thus he tagged the church the Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe. The structure, operational guidelines, doctrines, beliefs and practices of the church are like those held by the C & S Zion, Ugbonla. However, the clerical order and titles of religious specialists in the community differ from those used in Ugbonla. As a theocratic settlement, the community holds religious meetings twice daily in the only religious house built and permitted within its borders. The religious specialists in the community daily bring the congregation inspiring sermons, songs in the spiritually charged atmosphere. The community’s annual conventions and anniversaries are moments of spiritual rejuvenation and revival. 


Compared to other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, Zion Pepe seems to have enjoyed more stable succession processes to the throne. Of the six Obas (monarchs) who have reigned in the community, only once was there some dispute in the process leading to the selection of the successor. The community also appears to be liberal when scouting for the a new Oba. They have brought prophets who were domiciled in branches of the church to lead the community while passing over some other powerful and eligible prophets in the headquarters. Zion Pepe continues to enjoy a stable spiritual atmosphere as it has also made considerable gains in their social and economic aspirations.",1951,2023,2040,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-08-02 16:11:58.067 +0200,2023-09-14 11:21:43.768 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1898,Shurpu Incantation Series,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Shurpu, the Akkadian word for “burning,” denotes a ritual series where an incantation-priest systematically manipulated and burned objects (e.g., an onion, date clusters, bed matting, goat hair, grain flour, etc.) that signified the patient’s physical ailments and their causes. The goal of the ritual was to sympathetically remove whatever was afflicting the patient. Thus, for example, the first action the text prescribes is to peel and burn an onion, thereby “peeling” the patient’s pain and sickness from them and “burning” it off. 

While the magical manipulation and burning of objects corresponding to the patient’s afflictions is arguably the climax of the (nearly completely preserved) canonical Shurpu series found in Assurbanipal’s library, this text—our primary source of knowledge for the ritual—is much more complex. Consisting of 9 tablets, tablets V-VI contain the incantations for the patient’s purification via ritual burning and presents these instructions as originating from the god Marduk after he took note of the afflicted patient and asked his father Ea, the god of wisdom, about the proper course of treatment. Tablet VI ends with two incantations wishing for the ritual to placate the gods and petitioning them to judge calmly and not out of anger. 

The source of affliction in the Shurpu series is primarily understood as retribution for some wrong the patient had committed, even if the patient did not know exactly what it was. Thus, tablet II constitutes the most comprehensive surviving Mesopotamian sin list, its length owing to the hope that the patient’s error could be found therein and remediated by being named and ritually removed by the incantation-priest. Tablet II ends with a petition to an impressive array of deities to eliminate the patient’s sin and its consequences. Tablet III petitions the god of magic, Asalluḫi, to free the patient from curses arising from a lengthy list of possibly unfulfilled oaths, curses cast on the patient by others, or harm done by numinous power invoked during oath-taking. Tablet IV further petitions Marduk, the great punisher and protector, along with a litany of other deities, to free the patient from guilt and curse—whatever might have caused the affliction—and invokes many other deities to assist in the process. Tablet VII repeats Marduk’s interaction with Ea in tablet V-VI, but this time Ea gives abbreviated instructions to purify the patient by wiping them down with flour, having the patient spit on it (presumably to transfer guilt and its consequences), reciting an incantation over it, and leaving the mixture in the floodplain so that the gods may eliminate the impurities. Tablet VIII again invokes a litany of deities, foremost Marduk, to free the patient from guilt and curse, but also mentions witchcraft, and refers to a ritual where the patient is washed and purified with water, special stones, and special plants. Tablet IX contains 13 incantations to stimulate the efficacy of different plants and water sources used in the ritual. Tablet I has not been confidently identified. All copies (most are fragmentary) of the Shurpu Series come from Neo-Assyrian period archives, although it is likely that the work was first composed, as were many works of enduring value, in Kassite Babylonia (c. 1300). 

Several factors mitigate against our ability to reconstruct the precise practice of the Shurpu ritual from the ancient Shurpu composition, such as differences among the tablets of Shurpu regarding the means of purification and cause of misfortune; the seeming accumulation of incantations regarding or prayers to various deities—a tendency that can be modestly confirmed by the existence of a few disjointed passages appearing in other ancient works; and the existence of a tablet from Assur that attests to a somewhat different Shurpu ritual in terms of order, content, and length. It is best, then, to see the canonical Nineveh text as a scholarly semi-anthology with an unknown, but presumably complex, relationship to actual practice.",-1300,-610,2025,1424,Ryan Replogle,2023-08-02 21:41:45.908 +0200,2023-11-28 23:49:31.931 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1902,Dodona,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Dodona in Epirus was reputedly the oldest oracle in ancient Greece. The oracle and its sanctuary were dedicated to Zeus Naios, whose local consort was Dione Naia. References to the oracle go back to the Homeric epics, from which we hear of the Selloi (or Helloi), the prophets who were said to sleep in the sanctuary with unwashed feet (Il. 16.233-35), or of the sacred oak that spoke oracles with the voice of Zeus (Od. 14.327-28 = 19.296-97). In later periods, sources refer to oracular responses being derived from the sound of the wind passing through the leaves of the sacred oak or from the movement of the doves sitting in the tree (Hdt. 2.55). Homer's barefoot Selloi also largely disappear from the historical record, being replaced by the middle of the fifth century BCE by three priestesses known as Peleiades, that is, ""Doves"" (Hdt. 2.55; Strabo 7.329; Paus. 10.12.10). The oracle typically gave responses to individuals in a private capacity, though it was occasionally consulted officially by states. The standard practice involved the petitioner writing their question on a lead tablet, which received a ""yes"" or ""no"" response from the oracle. The popularity of Dodona waxed and waned in antiquity. Though the sanctuary was extremely ancient (archaeological evidence confirms that the site was occupied from the Early Helladic Period, with a sanctuary in use from probably the thirteenth century BCE), the remoteness of Dodona led to the oracle being eclipsed by Delphi in historical times. During the reign of Pyrrhus in the early third century BCE, Dodona became the religious center of Epirus and Macedonia; the Naia Festival, probably celebrated every four years, was established at this time. The site was sacked by the Aetolians in 219 BCE and later suffered after the Roman destruction of Epirus in 167 BCE; though the sanctuary was restored and remained in use in some capacity until the fourth century CE, it never recovered its former importance.",-1200,392,2031,841,Avi Kapach,2023-08-03 15:29:20.966 +0200,2023-08-15 20:03:47.301 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1908,"Buddhist Traders in the Chinese Quarter in Hakata, Japan",43,Religious Group (v6),"The ""Chinese Quarter"" in Hakata, Japan, was a residential area that existed around 1100 - 1300 near Hakata Bay. The Chinese Quarter was home to hundreds of households, most of whom were Chinese merchants. Those merchants, although they took permanent residence in Hakata, traveled between China and Japan frequently. The majority of the merchants were probably from the southeast coast of China, where many prestigious Buddhist monasteries were located. Due to certain regulations issued by the Japanese government, Chinese merchants were not allowed to take long residence in Japan until the twelfth century, when Dazaifu, the Kyushu Headquarters, loosened its control of foreign visitors. The retreat of Dazaifu became an opportunity for the Chinese merchants to lay down roots in Japan. 
Many of the merchants were devoted Buddhist laymen. They frequently visited monasteries in both China and Japan and thus became crucial links between the continent and the archipelago. They donated to Buddhist monasteries in both China and Japan. The Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo, China, has preserved three bricks that recorded the merchants from the ""Chinese Quarter"" (Tang fang 唐房) in Hakata made donations to pave a pilgrim road in Ningbo. The merchants also formed a close relationship with monks by providing transportation for the monks to cross the sea and serving as their messengers. Certain merchants even earned a position in Buddhist records. The Buddhist traders in the Chinese Quarter played an important role in spreading Zen Buddhism from China to Japan. 
Some wealthy merchants even helped to build the earliest Zen monasteries in Japan, right in the Chinese Quarter. Xie Guoming 謝國明 is a representative figure. He was originally from Hangzhou, China, and lived in the Chinese Quarter and married a Japanese woman. He built a Zen monastery, Jōtenji, in the Chinese Quarter and invited a famous monk, Enni Ben'en, to be the founding abbot. Enni had studied at the prestigious Jingshan monastery in Hangzhou, and the collaboration among Buddhist traders and Buddhist masters further consolidated the Buddhist and commercial connections between Kyushu and southeast China.
The Buddhist traders in the Chinese Quarter also adopted religious practices unique to Japan. For example, archaeological evidence shows that Chinese merchants built sutra mounds in the Hakata area, a practice to prepare for the coming of the Final Dharma, which was popular only in Japan.",1100,1300,2035,1479,Yiwen Li,2023-08-09 08:47:21.919 +0200,2023-08-25 06:52:24.491 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1918,Contemporary Neo-Confucianism 當代新儒家,43,Religious Group (v6),"‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ is a philosophical system of thought or a philosophical school that develops its ideas based on a re-interpretation of traditional Confucianism, in order to make Confucianism more relevant to the needs of the modern world. Mainly developed by some thinkers who escaped from the mainland China to Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1949, ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ began to be influential in the academia in Hong Kong and Taiwan since the late 1950s, and finally affected Confucian studies in mainland China since the 1980s. The term ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ is, in fact, firstly suggested and promoted by the scholars in mainland China at that time. Theoretically, the group of ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ could include any scholars who share the same ideal of re-interpretating Confucianism in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, but the term practically refers to those who develop their thoughts in Hong Kong and Taiwan, as the re-interpretation of traditional Confucianism varies hugely between the scholars in these two places and the mainland. In general, ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ in Hong Kong and Taiwan regards Confucianism as the mainstream intellectual tradition in the Chinese society, and any modernization of China and the Chinese society needs to consider the pros and cons of this tradition. It is based on Confucianism that the Chinese people developed their model of modernization while it is also the same intellectual tradition that it may hinder Chinese society from progressing. Under such considerations, several important issues are to be handled: the relationship between Confucianism and democracy as well as science; the relationship between Confucianism and Western philosophy; and the relationship between Confucianism and other traditional Chinese thought such as Buddhism and Taoism. In general, ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ considers that Confucianism could not only co-exist with other Chinese traditions, democracy, science and Western philosophy, but even improve the quality of them. On the one hand, ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ seems progressive as it does not put Confucianism into a contradictory position with such modern values as democracy and science. On the other hand, however, it is considered conservative as it seems to hold a position that, in a sense, Confucianism is more important than the values mentioned above. ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ in Hong Kong and Taiwan involves some important figures, such as Xiong Shili (熊十力, 1885 – 1968), Carsun Chang (張君勱, 1887 – 1969), Liang Shuming (梁漱溟, 1893 – 1988), Ch'ien Mu (錢穆, 1895 – 1990), Thomé H. Fang (方東美, 1899 – 1977), Xu Fuguan (徐復觀, 1904 – 1982), Tang Junyi (唐君毅, 1909 – 1978) and Mou Zongsan (牟宗三, 1909 – 1995). However, as the approaches employed to re-interpret Confucianism differ among them, their conclusions towards the relationships between Confucianism and the issues mentioned above are also various. To a large extent, the term ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ simplifies the complexities of the thoughts of these thinkers, and the rationale behind using the term is in doubt in some ways. To make the situation more complicated, some scholars in Confucianism from the present mainland China, Jiang Qing (蔣慶，1953 – present) for example, challenge the usage of the term, claiming that mainland China has her own perspective of re-interpreting traditional Confucianism and this perspective is different from those in Hong Kong and Taiwan. To the scholars from the mainland, Confucianism is the essence of Chinese culture and it is not correct to think of its relationship with those issues coming from the West, such as democracy and science. This kind of interpretation of Confucianism is considered highly conservative though it is rather popular in the academia of mainland China. Due to the diversity of interpretation, the term ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ has never had a rigid definition. Despite its popularity, ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’ is mainly a target of discussion in academia rather than a religious or philosophical group with influence in society.",1950,2023,2052,1471,King Pong Chiu,2023-08-11 06:05:54.711 +0200,2023-09-02 00:54:15.739 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1919,Acropolis of Monte Polizzo,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Iron Age settlement of Monte Polizzo (713 m asl) sits upon an interconnected group of ridges in western Sicily. The settlement was plausibly founded by Elymian people at the end of the eighth century BCE and reached its peak of population after a century and a half when it underwent a massive reorganization with the creation of terraces and the building of new structures. The site is approximately 11.8 ha in size, and consists of a ceremonial acropolis surrounded by clusters of houses and other structures. The acropolis housed sacred buildings: a large circular temple (turned into a rectangular one roughly twenty-five years after its construction) dedicated to a local goddess, and other smaller sacella.",-800,-500,2038,927,Kate Minniti,2023-08-13 22:52:44.545 +0200,2024-02-13 16:31:56.468 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1921,Zhouxun 周訓,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zhouxun or Instructions of the Zhou is a late Warring States text, which, alongside several other manuscripts, was donated to Peking University in 2009 and published in the third volume of the Peking University collection in 2015. The provenance of the collection and the circumstances of its discovery remain unknown. Hence, the texts comprised in it are often categorized as “looted”. The obtained copy of the Zhouxun was, most likely, produced in the early first century BCE, so, unlike some other “looted” manuscripts, it is not a contemporary forgery. The Beida Zhouxun has no counterpart in the received literature. But there is a mention of an eponymous text in 14 chapters in the Daoist section of the Hanshu bibliography. Intriguingly, the recovered manuscript contains exactly the same number of chapters. It is plausible to assume that the Beida manuscript and the Zhouxun listed in the Hanshu represent versions of the same text. Firstly, it is unlikely that two different texts with the same title and scope existed during roughly the same period of time, and, secondly, some ideas promoted in the Beida Zhouxun can, indeed, be associated with Daoist lore (even though its overall philosophical outlook is rather “eclectic”). The extant version is structured around the alleged encounters between Lord Zhaowen of Zhou 周昭文公 and Prince Gong 共大子. The characters refer to two members of Zhou aristocracy, who, mentioned in several pre-imperial and early Han works, lived in the second half of the 4th century BCE. However, the Zhouxun is unique in depicting them together, namely, as a father and his heir. According to the text, Prince Gong attended the court of his father, situated in the capital of the East Zhou, Chengzhou 成周, on the first day of each month (including the intercalary month) as well as on the day after the La-Festival of an unspecified year. Over the course of these fourteen audiences, the ruler is shown to personally admonish the prince to become “worthy” (xian 賢) lest he be replaced by a more suitable sibling. After all, the entire history of early China, as recounted by Lord Zhaowen, demonstrates that enduring political success can be achieved only when succession in a lineage is determined solely by the sons’ abilities. Consequently, the Zhouxun promotes a model of power transfer, which combines meritocratic and hereditary elements. It appears to react to contemporaneous discussions about the correct principles of succession and to reach a compromise between two antagonistic positions. This standpoint effectively liberates the father-son relationship from the constraints of ritual, which normally stipulates the heirs’ claims to succession. At the same time, the creation of the Zhouxun may have been motivated by concrete political events. In particular, its rejection of primogeniture appears to resonate with the fact that King Zhuangxiang of Qin, who sealed the Zhou’s demise in 249 BCE, was a son by a concubine. Against this background, the Zhouxun’s peculiar historical vision might be viewed as an attempt to legitimise the Qin’s replacement of the Zhou and to praise its leadership (Fech 2023, 71-72 and 204). This context of creation could also explain the Zhouxun’s close parallels with the Lüshi chunqiu, a work compiled under the auspices of Lü Buwei, who was the driving force behind the installation of King Zhuangxiang.",-340,-240,2041,1505,Andrej Fech,2023-08-15 19:31:14.783 +0200,2023-08-23 10:00:54.851 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1924,The Deuteronomistic History,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The so-called “Deuteronomistic History” is a scholarly category that groups the books of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings for their similar terminology and theological orientation. Martin Noth is often credited with the “discovery” of the Deuteronomistic History, although connections between the various books had been noted by scholars long before Noth’s own synthesis (See the works of Wellhausen, de Wette, and Ewald). Noth defined the Deuteronomistic History as a history of the nations of Israel/Judah which articulated the theological reasons for Israel’s fall in 722BCE and Judah’s exile in 586BCE. The Judean scribe(s) behind this history maintain that God allowed – perhaps even orchestrated – the fall of Israel and Judah because the kings and the people neglected the terms of the covenant set forth in the book of Deuteronomy. However, scholars like Frank Moore Cross also found more positive themes expressed throughout the “history” such as God’s promise to always uphold the Davidic monarchy and the permanence of God’s presence in the temple in Jerusalem. Other themes that appear frequently throughout the “history” include warnings against idolatry, the importance of centralizing worship (at the Jerusalem temple), and the complicated nature of kingship. Along with these broad themes, the books within the “history” share certain terms and phraseology such as “going after other gods,” “the place the LORD will cause his name to dwell,” “walk in the ways of the LORD,” “keep the commandments/statues/testimonies/judgements of the LORD,” “doing good/evil in the eyes of the LORD,” and “for the sake of my servant David.” (See Weinfeld Appendix A for full list). Overall, the Deuteronomistic History appears to project a Judean perspective which favors the temple in Jerusalem, the Davidic monarchy, and the laws/ covenantal terms in the book of Deuteronomy. However, when analyzing these key phrases, terms, and theological perspectives, it is important to note that no book within the Deuteronomistic history is composed solely of Deuteronomistic themes/phrases, meaning the books themselves remain quite distinct. Moreover, each book employs these themes/phrases in different ways and in different quantities. For example, Deuteronomistic language appears heavily in texts that describe key moments in the history of Israel/Judah. These include the fall of the Northern Kingdom (2 Kings 17), the construction of the Jerusalem temple (1 Kings 8), the establishment of the Davidic monarchy (1 Samuel 12/2 Samuel 7), the reign of Josiah and the discovery of the “Law” (2 Kings 22), and the fall of Judah (2 Kings 23-25). The books of Judges and Joshua by contrast, contain very little Deuteronomistic phrases/themes, and the language that does appear occurs only in transition points or in speeches (see portions of Judges 1-2, 6, 10, 19-21, and Joshua 23). Thus, it is important to remember that the Deuteronomistic History is merely a scholarly category used to describe the phenomena of shared terms, phrases, and themes across different texts in the Hebrew Bible. There remain large divisions within the field regarding the scope, dating, and even existence of the Deuteronomistic History as a unified scribal enterprise. Please see the bibliography for theories concerning dating the Deuteronomistic History and theories concerning its history of composition and redaction.",-700,-300,1404,1380,Morganne Ottobre,2023-08-15 21:20:53.150 +0200,2023-08-15 21:20:53.150 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1939,"Panagia Parigoritissa, Arta",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of Panagia Parigoritissa (meaning Virgin Mary of Consolation) at the centre of the city of Arta, Epirus, is dedicated to the Annunciation. It was constructed around the end of the 13th century by the despot of Epirus Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, his wife Anna Palaiologina and their son Thomas, as indicated by the inscription on the western wall (Κομνηνοδούκας δεσπότης Νι[κηφ]όρος Αννα βασίλ[ισσ]α κομνη[οδούκαινα] Κομνηνόβλαστος δ[εσπότης Θ]ωμάς μέγας Κομνην[οί Ελ]λάδος α[υτάνακτες] ή Κομνην[ών κ]λάδος α[γγελωνύμων]). The church was formerly the katholikon (main church) of a Monastery, of which currently the Refectory and the monks’ or nuns’ cells are still preserved.
The three-storey katholikon was built following an original model, not encountered elsewhere, in particular the way the dome is supported, resting on eight pilasters that support three rows of columns. The whole space under the dome is therefore remaining undisturbed. The church’s ground floor has an octagonal plan, while the first floor is of the cross-in-square type. It possesses two chapels (north and south) dedicated to the Taxiarchs (Archangels) and Saint John the Baptist, which communicate with the narthex. In the east the church ends in five apses. The church has a square, block-like exterior. On its horizontal roofline appear five domes and a lantern.
The interior is decorated with brickwork, carved elements, blind arcades, in some cases polychrome. The base of the dome is also adorned with sculptural decoration, carved by craftsmen from the West, possibly Italy. The main dome features mosaic depictions of the Pantocrator, the Prophets, cherubim and seraphim that are contemporary with the monument. They were most probably executed by two different teams of craftsmen, believed to have come from either the byzantine capital, Constantinople, or, Thessaloniki. The wall-paintings in the sanctuary are the work of monk Ananias and date from 1558. Those in the nave were probably executed in the late 17th or early 18th century, while the paintings in the narthex are even later. The church originally had marble revetment, up to the level of the surrounding galleries, a few fragments of which are still remaining above the main entrance on the west side. The built iconostasis replaced the original one made of marble, of which only some pieces are still preserved. 
The church of Parigoritissa was built on the site of an earlier, smaller church, parts of which are visible on the north side of the nave. Outside the south west corner of the church are still preserved the ruins of a smaller, also earlier church, possibly of the 12th century. The cross-in-square church with three apses at the east, was likely used as funeral chapel, after Parigoritissa (the katholikon) was built. The Monastery is mentioned for the first time as a convent for nuns in a sigillium (decree) of 1578 by Patriarch Ieremias II.
To the south-east of the katholikon is found a rectangular, barrel-vaulted building, which was the Refectory of the Monastery. It currently houses an exhibition of sculptures from the early Christian period to the 14th century that originate from byzantine monuments in Arta and its vicinity.",1290,2023,2043,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-08-20 21:46:34.553 +0200,2023-08-22 08:14:00.606 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1940,"The Holy Apostles Community, Ori-Oke Iwamimo",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Holy Apostles Community, Ori-Oke Iwamimo was originally called ''The Maran Apostles community.'' It was known by this nomenclature for a little over two decades until it changed to its current name in 1972. Unlike the other dominant theocratic communities in Ilajeland which were started on virgin lands, Ori-Oke Iwamimo had been established by the father of Prophet Wilson Etan Ikudehinbo, the first leader of this theocratic community. Ikudehinbu was a former member of the Ayetoro theocratic community. He left Ayetoro due to some irreconcilable differences between himself and the monarch of Ayetoro in late 1950. By this time, the idea of theocratic settlements was becoming fashionable in Ilajeland due to the initial successes recorded by Ayetoro and Ugbonla. Ikudehinbu was therefore allowed to settle in Ori-Oke iwamimo and to propagate his faith in the manner he deemed fit. By 1951, the community became a theocratic settlement and was led by Ikudehinbu until August 2002 when he passed on. His son, Prophet Alebiosu has led the community since 2004. This was after the fierce leadership tussle which engulfed the community after Ikudehinbu’s demise had been apprehended. 

Ori-Oke Iwamimo community has been quite vibrant in their faith. Their mode of worship is like that found in other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, especially that of Ayetoro. However, they have also developed and maintained other distinct practices which stand them apart from their peers in the Ilaje littoral. Significant among their distinct practices maintained during the lifetime of the first Oba (monarch) is the special annual worship which held at the seashore beside the community church. During the performance of this ritual, the Oba invoked the sea. It is believed in the community that by some uncommon powers he causes the wave to rise and flood parts of the settlement. The Oba stands with his back to the sea while the congregation faces him. As the ritual gets under way, a big bowl is placed on a table in the glare of the people. When the water floods the arena, some of it is retained in the bowl. Special interventions are reported when the water leaps on the congregation. Before the ritual is ended, the water trapped in the bowl is sprinkled on the congregants. It is widely held in the community that the water sprinkled on participants is efficacious in bringing protection, good luck, healing and other favours to the congregants. 

Ori-Oke Iwamimo joins Ayetoro, Ugbonla and Zion Pepe to complete the list of the four most prosperous theocratic communities in Ilajeland. By a series of deliberate actions, the community lobbied the government of the Western State of Nigeria in the late 1960s and early 1970s to request the dredging of the canal which connects it and other villages to the Alape river. This was after it had previously conducted a manual dredging of the same canal with some successes. Ori-Oke Iwamimo remains the only theocratic community among the four most prominent in Ilajeland which has not adopted the use of prayer garments.",1950,2023,2044,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-08-20 22:24:54.659 +0200,2023-09-14 11:25:29.948 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1941,Tang Junyi 唐君毅,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Tang Junyi (唐君毅，1909 – 1978) was one of the most influential thinkers in modern Chinese society, especially in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Widely considered a member of ‘Contemporary Neo-Confucianism’, Tang employed Buddhist ideas, Huayan thought in particular, to develop his philosophical system, which tried to harmonize different valuable thoughts so that they could co-exist without conflict. Within this harmonization, one could, on the one hand, choose his or her faith, while on the other hand, would not reject others’. Tang clearly stated that he believed in Confucianism, an intellectual tradition which pays attention to the existence of consciousness or benevolence, as he considered the thought most relevant to his own moral experience. There were some examples that Tang stressed throughout his writings: while once seeing the land split due to drought in his childhood, he worried that the earth would soon end; while watching a movie about Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙，1866 – 1925), the founder of the Republic of China, he wondered, compared with the whole universe, how little a human being was but how great a human being could achieve; while separating from his parents, he genuinely felt sadness. As Tang said, all of his philosophical thought derived from such moral experience and, therefore, his thought could be understood as his explanation of the existence of consciousness, how it worked and what would be achieved if it was fully utilized. Tang’s complete works were initially published in Taiwan in 1991, and a revised edition was released in mainland China in 2016. Despite Tang’s obscure writing style, many of his works are considered modern classics in the field of Chinese philosophy. The Experience of Life 人生之體驗, for example, suggests different moral experiences a human may face in his or her life, in which Tang reflected on the moral ability a human could have and the function of such ability. The Formation of Moral Self 道德自我之建立, tries to explain the existence of the moral ability from a philosophical perspective, claiming that moral ability is not only an experience felt by individual persons but a universal faculty that is owned by all people. The Reconstruction of Humanistic Spirit 人文精神之重建 mentions Tang’s ultimate ideal, which is to make the world full of humanistic values by means of fully utilizing the moral abilities of all persons. The Existence of Life and Horizons of Mind 生命存在與心靈境界, his last and probably most important work, explains that the real humanistic value is exactly not to reject any valuable thoughts and how moral ability helps harmonize different values so that a humanistic world could be achieved. As Tang always emphasized the importance of self-transformation and his works tend to encourage and inspire others to transform, some scholars considered that the nature of Tang’s thought is like a kind of religion, though his faith is not in an external god, but in the internal goodness of humanity.",1930,2023,2052,1471,King Pong Chiu,2023-08-22 02:27:54.894 +0200,2023-09-07 20:01:59.951 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1942,Gre Virike: Early Bronze Age Cultic Installations,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Gre Virike is located on the east bank of the Euphrates River, about 10 km north of the Turkey-Syria border. Rescue excavations at Gre Virike were undertaken within the Salvage Project of the Archaeological Heritage of the Ilısu and Carchemish Dam Reservoirs in Turkey. Excavations at the site were conducted by Prof. Dr. A. Tuba Ökse under the auspices of the Şanlıurfa Museum. The center was built on a gravel terrace ca. 10 km north of the ancient city of Carchemish. The high temple terraces that arose in Mesopotamia during the 4th millennium BC were built on natural hills or mounds in Northern Mesopotamia due to the rugged terrain.
On some of the terraces dating to the 3rd millennium BC, monumental chamber tomb complexes were built overtop of temple architecture and open-air ritual spaces. The high terrace built on Gre Virike is represented by water, incense, and sacrifices in the first half of the 3rd millennium BC, and by monumental burial complexes in the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. In the Middle Euphrates basin, both high terraces and monumental tombs exist together.
The fact that these ritual areas, which are seen in the Middle Euphrates basin and established at intervals of 18-20 km on average, are at such distances that people living in the surrounding rural settlements can return to their destination within the same day, suggests that these areas may have been built for rural settlements. When the dimensions of the labor and materials used in the construction of the terraces are calculated, the existence of an influential political structure in the region emerges in this period. It is understood that the rich people belonging to the kingdom at Ebla, which dominated the region west of the Euphrates River, may have ruled these rural areas and that the monumental chamber tombs belonging to these people were built in these ritual areas.

1947,Temple of the Storm-God in Aleppo,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This entry gives an overview of the architecture, history and importance of the temple of the Storm-God in Aleppo, Syria (see chronological table). The temple together with the city is first attested textually and archaeologically in the middle of the 3rd mill. BCE. At this time the Storm-God of Aleppo seems to be venerated in the bigger region of northern Syria already. In the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000–1600) the temple was in the capital of the powerful kingdom of Yamḫad, promoting the importance of the Storm-God, the head of the pantheon of Ḫalab and one of the highest in Syria. Even after the fall of this dynasty, his importance did not decline. First Mittani ruled over Aleppo but was then defeated by the Hittites, who established a secundogeniture in the city. The temple was renovated and the Storm-God had already been adopted into the Hittite pantheon and venerated. This prompted the continuing importance of the temple, the growing prominence of the Storm-God of Aleppo and the spread of his cult and its iconography. By this time the Storm-God of Aleppo was venerated from Ugarit to Nuzi and up to Ḫattuša, showcasing the importance of this local deity. In the Iron Age the information is more scarce, but we know of a king Taita renovating the temple in the 11th cent. BCE. The temple stayed the cultic centre in northern Syria throughout the 1st mill. BCE.
Since all of the textual attestations of the temple and its daily life have been found in other cities, most things about the cult, the festivals and the rituals remain in the dark. Aleppo is one of the oldest cities that are permanently occupied and therefore excavations are very limited. The discovery of archives in Aleppo would contribute a lot to the history of the temple and the city. Only the rich decoration and ground plan of the temple remain today. The importance of the temple is secured by many letters, religious texts and offering lists from Syria, Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia naming the local Storm-God of Aleppo. Due to his widespread importance and veneration the Storm-God can be called by different names, depending on the cultural background: Hadda, Addu, Teššub, Tarḫunta, Baʻal and Hadad. His unique iconography sets him apart from other Storm-God depictions.",-2500,-500,2053,1346,Albert Dietz,2023-09-04 10:55:12.195 +0200,2023-09-07 20:26:30.809 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1948,The Serapeum of Alexandria,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Serapeum of Alexandria, which contained the Temple of Serapis, was Alexandria's most important sanctuary and one of the most famous pagan sanctuaries of antiquity. It was also the center of a cult that spread widely across the Mediterranean in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Ptolemy III Euergetes (reigned 246-222 BCE) built the temple dedicated to Serapis, the patron deity of Alexandria and the Ptolemaic kingdom. The site is located on a rocky plateau, overlooking land and sea. By all detailed accounts, the Serapeum was the largest and most magnificent of all temples in Alexandria. The Serapeum was part of a larger complex. The temple was inside a large precinct, surrounded by a portico lined with rooms. The precinct suffered a major ﬁre in 181 CE. It was rebuilt and substantially enlarged. The Serapeum was destroyed in 391 CE during the disputes between pagans and Christians. After the destruction, a church was built for St. John the Baptist, known as Angelium. However, the church fell to ruins around 600 CE, restored by Pope Isaac of Alexandria (681-684 CE), and finally destroyed in the 10th century. In the 20th century, a Muslim cemetery, Bāb Sidra, was located at the site.",-246,391,2054,1322,Athanasios Koutoupas,2023-09-05 17:26:12.509 +0200,2023-09-05 17:35:38.683 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1952,Daodejing 道德經,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Daodejing 道德經 (“Classic of the Way and Virtue”) is the title, fixed toward the end of the second century CE, attributed to a roughly 5000-character book, divided into 81 chapters, and recognized, together with the Zhuangzi 莊子, as the fundamental text for the philosophical tradition called “Daoism” (Daojia 道家) – as well as for the later religious movement called “religious Daoism” (Daojiao 道教). The text is also known by the name of its traditionally credited author, Laozi 老子 (the Old Master) or by the title Wuqianwen 五千文 (“Classic of the Five Thousands Characters”). The historicity of its author has long been a matter of scholarly discussion: the first biographical notes on his figure, mostly inconsistent with each other, date back to the 1st century BCE and are found within Sima Qian 司馬遷 (c. 145–86 BCE) historiographical work, the Shiji 史記. To date, most scholars believe that Laozi represents a legendary figure whose historicization was the result of an attempt to legitimize philosophical and meditative practices associated with Daoism, and that the text is a collection of passages put together by different editors and compilers rather than the work of a single hand.
Both transmitted and unearthed versions of this text have come down to us and are characterized by varying degrees of variation: in the total number of characters, the division into chapters, the division into the two sections of Daojing 道經 (“Classic of the Way”, chapters 1-37) and Dejing 德經 (“Classic of the Virtue”, chapters 38-81) and the sequence of the two sections, lexical variations, etc.
Of the versions transmitted by tradition, the main ones are known by the name of the commentary to which they are attached. To name the most credited, among almost a thousand commentaries known to date, a version transmitted together with the commentary written by the Sanguo 三國 period (220 to 280 AD) philosopher Wang Bi 王弼 (226-249 AD), called the Wang Bi version; the Heshang Gong 河上公 version, which enjoyed enormous authority, but whose dating is uncertain (hypotheses range from the 2nd century BCE to the 4th century CE); the Yan Zun 巖尊 (59-24 BCE) version, which only includes the Dejing section of the text (the Daojing section apparently went lost between 1200 and 1445).
As for the earliest reference to the Laozi, the earliest commentator on the text of which we are aware is the philosopher and intellectual Han Feizi (280-233 B.C.): two chapters of his work, entitled Jie Lao 解老 (“Commentary on the Laozi”) and Yu Lao 喻老 (“Explanation of the Laozi”), comment on several chapters of the Laozi. The quoted passages are very close, though not identical to those found in the textus receptus.

As for the unearthed sources, there have been several archaeological finds that have unearthed fragments and texts related to the Laozian textual tradition, including passages engraved on stone or jade and manuscripts on silk and bamboo. The most significant findings include manuscript versions found in Dunhuang 敦煌, Mawangdui 馬王堆 and Guodian 郭店. The so-called Xiang’er 想爾 edition of the Laozi, accompanied by the Xiang’er commentary to the text, has been recovered from the Buddhist grottoes of Dunhuang (Gansu) at the beginning of the twentieth century and only includes the Daojing section.
The two archaeological discoveries at the Mawangdui site in 1973 and the Guodian site in 1993 contributed greatly to the understanding of the textual history of the Daodejing. 
In fact, two silk scrolls containing two almost complete copies of the Daodejing were unearthed at the Mawangdui site (Changsha, Hunan) in a tomb dated to 168 BCE, together with various philosophical and medical works. These texts, referred to as Text A (甲) and Text B (乙), distinguished by a few lexical differences, reverse the traditional order of the book's sections, having the Dejing section first and the Daojing section next.
Regarding the find at the Guodian site (Jingmen, Hubei), in Tomb No. 1, dated around 300 BCE, these are three bamboo scrolls distinguished by different handwriting and bamboo strips, comprising a total of around one third of the transmitted Daodejing (about 1750 characters), with variations from the transmitted text in the lexicon, division of chapters, and the absence of the division into the Daojing and Dejing sections. Moreover, of the three scrolls, the so-called scroll C has identical bamboo strip length, binding marks and handwriting from another text, titled Taiyi sheng shui 太一生水 – possibly originally bound together with Guodian Laozi C. The division into several scrolls of material closely related to the textual tradition of the Daodejing, together with the presence of another manuscript linked to one of the three scrolls, contributed to the understanding of what might have been the perception of the Daodejing as a unitary text in the third century BCE. Conceivably, the Daodejing did not stabilize as a unified text until the second century BCE, and even in the early imperial period it seems plausible that several different editions were circulating rather than one standard or official edition. 
As for the content of the work, the various chapters or stanzas (zhang 章) are heterogeneous in themes and vary in length. These contain maxims and aphorisms, written in partially rhymed prose. The traditional division into the two sections of Daojing and Dejing probably originates from the very fact that the first chapter of the Daojing section focuses on the concept of Dao 道 (Way), while the first chapter of the Dejing section focuses on the concept of De 德 (Virtue).  
In addition to the Dao as a cosmic, ineffable principle, not expressible through language, which governs the mechanisms of the cosmos, and the De, as a potency or virtue derived from the Dao itself, the Daodejing deals with several other issues: the concept of wuwei 無為 (avoidance of action), the opposition between being (you 有) and non-being (wuyou 無有), the cosmogonic process that brings about the emergence of the ten thousand things, the simplicity that recalls the uncarved wood (pu 樸), the sage person (shengren 聖人) that avoids action and is reluctant to war, the unity with the Dao, that is the ultimate achievement of the sage, as well as an anti-Confucian stance, which is most evident in the textus receptus but significantly less explicit in the manuscript version found in Guodian.",-300,2023,1272,1195,Francesca Puglia,2023-09-06 12:02:46.220 +0200,2023-09-08 21:50:00.273 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1957,Wadi Sarga Monastery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Wadi Sarga is located in Middle Egypt on the west bank of the Nile, c. 25km south of modern Asyut. Greek and Coptic texts dating from the 6th to 8th centuries suggest that the site was the location of a Monastery of Apa Thomas. Excavations were carried out between 1913 and 1914, but the results were never published in full due to the beginning of the First World War. The monastic settlement was developed in and around the existing pharaonic gallery quarries cut into the slopes of Wadi Sarga. The galleries were transformed into living quarters, while in a long gallery a ‘Church cave’ (or ‘Rock Church’) with an extensive painted program was created. The iconographic programme included haloed figures, busts of haloed saints, a depiction of John the Baptist and Zacharias and the Holy Spirit ‘descending like a dove’. The scene of the Communion of the apostles has been represented on the half-dome of the apse. Other habitation sectors were constructed on the steep slopes of the ‘gabal’. They were mainly mud-brick buildings, some supported by dry-stone construction foundations. A long, rectangular building (50m) has been described by Campbell Thompson as a ‘stabl’ or ‘caravansserie’, and was probably a place for the pack animals. At the mouth of the wadi, in and around the so-called vallum, was an apparently contemporary cemetery (Cemetery 1), with mud-brick lined grave-cuts containing badly preserved human remains. The archaeological and the textual evidence indicate that this was a flourishing and wealthy community that was involved in economic activities. The monks were in contact with the neighbouring monastic sites of Bawit and Deir el-Bala’izah. Unfortunately, nowadays Wadi Sarga is inaccessible because it has been converted into a military zone.",500,800,983,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2023-09-10 01:33:42.321 +0200,2023-09-10 17:14:52.037 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1958,The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe is a Pentecostal church. Pentecostalism has taken the world by storm and the Apostolic Faith Mission is among churches representing this movement. It is said to be the mother of Pentecostalism in Zimbabwe. Essentially, the church traces its history back to the Azusa experience in America which is believed gave birth to Pentecostalism. An American evangelist by the name John Graham Lake came to South Africa and started the Apostolic Faith Mission South Africa (AFMSA). Zimbabwean mine workers who were working in South Africa got attracted to this form of Christianity and then brought Pentecostalism to Zimbabwe. The Apostolic Faith Mission South Africa then sent some people to be in charge as the church grew. Paul Kruger is amongst the leaders who came from South Africa who played a great role in the establishment of the Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe. The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe was under the administration of AFMSA for a number of years. The leadership was predominantly white during that time. When the leadership was finally handed over to the black Zimbabweans the church has had 4 presidents who were all male. Amongst the first converts were Chiumbu, Masembe, Mutemererwa, Kupara, Mugodhi, Mashavave and the Gwanzura brothers, John, Petros, Enoch and Ezekiel. These also played a big role in planting assemblies throughout the country and are highly regarded in the church even though they are all late. This church is heavily influenced by the patriarchal ideology such that the leadership is predominantly male. Male dominance is highly promoted both in church and at home. Men make decisions and women have to follow and obey. Men can be members of different church boards even if they are not pastors. Female pastors have never held the position of overseer or President (title for the top leader). The church was established in 1915 in Zimbabwe and women constitute the greatest number in terms of membership. Women are said to constitute 60% of the membership whilst men and children constitute the other 40%.The belief in the Holy spirit is central in the church and every member is expected to speak in tongues as evidence of being filled by the Holy spirit. When it was first established the church was characterized by healing and prophecy. This is one of the reason the church took long to be registered because the colonial government was skeptical of the practice of prophecy and miracle working. Amongst the prominent prophets in the early years were women. However as the years have gone by, prophecy and healing have become less practiced.",1915,2018,2058,1437,TERENCE MUPANGWA,2023-09-11 13:18:32.812 +0200,2024-03-22 11:36:37.110 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1959,Papyrus London 121 (PGM VII),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Papyrus London 121 contains the most extensive ritual collection among the corpus of the ancient Greek magical papyri known to us today. Within this corpus it is commonly referred to as ""PGM VII"" in modern scholarship. ""PGM"" is the abbreviation for ""Papyri Graecae Magicae"". 

The scroll measures about 2.33 meters in length and 33 cm in hight and it is inscribed on both sides with over 1.000 lines in Greek. 

Papyrus London 121 comprises a total of 67 complete ritual instructions accompanied by information about the best times for their performance, a prayer to Selêne, and three incomplete instructions. In addition, PGM VII contains an extensive dice-based Homer oracle providing 216 answers related to the number that is cast with three six-sided dice, as well as various non-magical recipes and even pranks. 

While the so-called ""Grand papyrus magique"" (PGM IV, P. Suppl. grec 574, Bibliothèque nationale de France) comprises over 3.200 lines and is often referred to as the most extensive ancient Greek magical papyrus, PGM VII contains more individual ritual instructions, which is often overlooked.

These ritual instructions in PGM VII are focused on three main areas: divination, love, and healing. They are supplemented by victory, protective amulets, and binding spells for various purposes. 

The dating of the papyrus is debated. The text was possibly created by more than one scribe and the potentially different hands are the reason that, until recently, the main hand was dated to the third century while the second hand was dated to the early fourth century. This interpretation has been disputed with recent publications arguing for a dating to the fourth century for the entire papyrus based on improved palaeographical insights. 

The findspot of PGM VII is unknown. It was purchased in Egypt in 1888 by the orientalist Wallis Budge for the British Museum together with several other Greek magical papyri. One of these papyri was inscribed with an account on one side prior to be re-used as a ritual manual (PGM XIa). This account is dated to July 336 AD and derives from Hermonthis, modern Armant, which is located approximately 20 km south of Thebes in Egypt. Because PGM VII was purchased together with this papyrus one theory is that it might also derive from Hermonthis. But this theory needs to be treated critically since we don't have detailed information about the purchase of the papyri nor about their origin, and it might just as well be that various papyri from different find spots were sold together.

Today the papyrus is kept in the British Library in London with the inventory number ""Papyrus London 121"".",250,350,2059,1392,Kirsten Dzwiza,2023-09-11 14:20:07.634 +0200,2023-10-08 12:01:06.578 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1960,The laura in Kom el-Ahmar/ Deir al Qarabin,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Kom el-Ahmar is a site of Middle Egypt, located on the eastern bank of the Nile, 3 km south of the village of Sharuna. It is situated on the border between the present day expansion of the agricultural area and the desert. This site was initially known for its Pharaonic and Ptolemaic antiquities: the necropolis with rock-cut tombs and the remains of a temple built by Ptolemies I and II. According to the literary sources, the site was the capital of the eighteenth Upper Egyptian nome. Its name, hw.t-nsw, is documented until the Ptolemaic period, but after that time no relevant textual evidence is preserved and the Coptic name of the locality is unknown. 
In Late Roman/ Byzantine times, a monastic settlement organised as a laura was developed in the desert. The hermits occupied the abandoned Pharaonic rock-cut tombs and constructed new cells at the terraces in front of them. The existing tombs underwent the necessary adjustments so as to function as habitations, workshops, storage rooms, or stables. So far twenty of the tomb-cells have been recorded. The economic and religious centre of the laura was located at the place called Deir el-Qarabin. The northern part of this site includes a large, square, refuge tower and an area with cooking and storage premises, a loom, and traces of wine production. The southern part is occupied by a religious compound including a square burial area flanked by a small chapel to the north and a church to the south. Most probably this was not the cemetery of the monastic community, since there were buried at least thirty individuals, men, women and children. A naturally mummified body was discovered in a somewhat undisturbed tomb, and a C14 analysis of the bones provided a date range between 380 and 560 AD (95.4% probability). The laura also included north of the great concentration of hermitages: i) at c. 0.5km the large, somewhat remote hermitage of el-Ghalida with a monastic cemetery, consisting of at least thirty male burials, and ii) at c. 3km, in a remote location, the hermitage of Deir Abu-Kalba.
900m west of Deir el-Qarabin, a funerary basilica surrounded by a vast cemetery has been unearthed. This complex is situated on a site previously occupied by a Ptolemaic cemetery. Only the foundations of the basilica remain and they include many reused limestone blocks that were extracted from the destroyed Ptolemaic temple. Two building phases have been identified. The earlier building was a three-aisled basilica with a western return aisle, a narthex, a portico, and a rectangular, tripartite sanctuary. In the east, a rectangular annex was added. In the west, at the southern corner of the narthex, there was a staircase towards the roof. In its final state, the naos was divided into five aisles. According to numismatic evidence, the first church was founded during the latter quarter of the fourth century or at the beginning of the fifth century. The second church was a three-aisled basilica, not considerably larger than the first. It was probably erected in the second half of the sixth century. Remodelling during this phase included the demolition of the eastern annex and the western portico. A crypt under the sanctuary, accessible by a staircase, was actually a single chambered tomb, over which the initial church building was constructed. This was probably the tomb of a saint, originally a local hermit. 
Based on the archaeological and numismatic evidence, the entire settlement at Kom el-Ahmar/Sharuna was probably abandoned in the seventh or eighth century, not as a result of intentional destruction or plundering.",375,700,2060,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2023-09-11 19:54:12.841 +0200,2023-09-15 00:45:49.079 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1961,"Grace Covenant Centre, Ado-Ekiti",43,Religious Group (v6),"Grace Covenant Centre, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria grew out of a Christian fellowship membered by some Christian staff of the then Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti (OSUA) and other categories of civil servants who were resident in the town in the 1990s. The group initially held their meetings at the defunct Ajitadidun premises in the Adebayo area of the town before building their permanent site near their former meeting place. Before organizing this fellowship, the leader of the group, Pastor Felix Aderibigbe had successfully started and groomed the first Pentecostal Christian student fellowship in OSUA in 1984. Grace Covenant Centre was therefore the second Christian group organized by the visionary Christian leader who had previously been engaged in Christian fellowship leadership during his days as a student at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. 

Being one of the first Pentecostal fellowships in the town, Grace Covenant Centre soon began to attract young, educated and upwardly mobile Christian professionals, businessmen and women and civil servants in Ado-Ekiti. The church which is known for building disciples of Jesus Christ has grown from its Adebayo assembly to open at least three other branches in Ado-Ekiti township. Besides, it has grown through its evangelistic outreach arm to set up a few other branches in other towns in Ekiti State. It also has a branch each in neighbouring Ondo and Ogun States. Being a church made up of academicians, technocrats and top executives in public and private sector, many of its branches are located near university campuses or membered by members of the academic community. It has also organised campus fellowships in universities and other tertiary institutions in Ado-Ekiti and other towns. The fellowship has grown to become one of the most popular Pentecostal movements in the city of Ado-Ekiti. 

The church organises several special programmes and annual conventions. It holds a summer prayer school in June of every year. In this programme, members are taught the principles of strategic prayers and exposed to certain underlying issues that must be addressed by Christians to be victorious in all their endeavours. At some point each year (mostly in February), it celebrates a jubilee crusade. This is a time for proclaiming liberty to those oppressed by sin, Satan and the world’s system. It celebrates its annual convention (Glory Conference) in the last full week of October. Members from the branches are encouraged to attend the annual convention which is usually power-packed. The church has built relationships with other Christian ministries and their leaders across the country. Leaders of such church ministries are often invited by the church to speak at their special programmes. As a faith community, the church emphasises love, fellowship and building strong horizontal and vertical relationships among members and with God through their Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ.",1990,2023,2064,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-09-12 13:53:27.561 +0200,2023-09-15 17:53:11.705 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1962,Huayan School 華嚴宗,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Huayan School is one of the most important Chinese Buddhist schools in historical China, which mainly prevailed in the medieval period, especially from the 7th to the 9th century. The School is developed from Huayanjing 華嚴經 (Skt. Avataṃsaka Sūtra; Eng. Garland Sūtra), or more precise, the interpretation of Huayanjing from some Chinese monks, and its appearance began in the time of Fazang 法藏 (643–712). In principle, Huayan patriarchs considered their philosophical systems ‘yuan’ 圓, a term, which, to a large extent, implies perfection and finality. From their perspectives, further theoretical development in Buddhism was considered unnecessary, if not impossible, though, in practice, the patriarchs stressed that the achievement of such a perfect and final status needed the help from other Buddhist schools or theories. In this sense, the ‘yuan’ teaching as Huayan School suggested is always all-inclusive. The traditional lineage of the Huayan patriarchs is as below: Dushun 杜順 (557–640), Zhiyan 智儼 (602–668), Fazang, Chengguan 澄觀 (738–839) and Zongmi 宗密 (780–841), and after that the School began to decline. According to Xu gaoseng zhuan 續高僧傳 (Continuation of Biographies of Eminent Monks), Dushun was a Chan master with supernatural power and his relationship with Huayanjing is largely unknown. Interestingly, Zhiyan claimed that his own understanding of Huayanjing was learned from Dushun, which provides the only hint about the potential relationship between Dushun and the Sūtra. In fact, Zhiyan once learned from the masters of the Nan Dilun 南地論宗 and Shelun Schools 攝論宗, the early schools of Consciousness-Only (Skt. Yogācāra; Chi. Weishi 唯識) in China. As Fazang noted, Zhiyan derived his profound understanding of Huayanjing from these masters, which implies a close relationship between Huayan thought and that of Consciousness-Only, though the relationship is observed competitive rather than cooperative. Fazang was called the third patriarch of the Huayan School, but he is actually the real founder of it, as the School began to gain its political and intellectual importance during his time. Fazang once explained his thought to Empress Wu 武后 (624–705) face-to-face around the year 700 and the speech is recorded in Jin shizi zhang 金師子章 (Treatise on the Golden Lion), a short passage which is regarded as a summary of the Huayan thought. After the death of Fazang, however, his disciple Huiyuan 慧苑 (673–743) amended the former’s ideas of doctrinal classification, arguing that certain elements, ‘sudden teaching’ in particular, should be removed from the doctrinal classification theory. This suggestion of Huiyuan was severely criticized by Chengguan, who was later considered the fourth patriarch of the School, and it is from Chengguan that the ideas of Huayan are finalized. The main characteristic of the Huayan thought is its emphasis on non-obstruction and even interpenetration between and among various phenomena. In short, as the Huayan patriarchs argues, the relationship among phenomena as seen from a Buddha perspective is always harmonious and under such harmonization any conflicts among phenomena can be avoided so that different phenomena can eventually co-exist. The key concepts of the Huayan thought, the Dharmadhātu of the non-obstruction of events 事事無礙法界, the Ten Mysterious Gates 十玄門 and the Harmony of Six Characters 六相圓融 for examples, are, to various extents, to explain the rationale behind such harmonization of phenomena. As a matter of fact, Zongmi, the fifth patriarch of the School, used Huayan thought to harmonize Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, and this act of harmonization hugely influenced the development of these different intellectual traditions in later China since the 10th century. Despite the significance of the Huayan School, the ‘Huichang Persecution’ 會昌法難, a political movement led by Emperor Wu of Tang 唐武宗 (814–846) in 845, which tried to destroy Buddhism fundamentally, accelerated the fall of the School. Since then, the Huayan School becomes a target of scholarly study rather than a religious group with real influence in society. Although individual monks in Republican China in the early 20th century tried to promote Huayan thought and revive the School, the outcome was in doubt. The situation that the School, if there is any, faces today, is no different from its predecessors in the past thousand years. More effort is definitely needed if development of the School is to be made.",670,845,809,1471,King Pong Chiu,2023-09-13 04:38:30.812 +0200,2023-09-22 00:19:15.736 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1963,"The Church of St. Anne, Anisaraki, Selino, Crete",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of St. Anne, located on the outskirts of the village of Anisaraki, is roughly 4km from the large village of Kandanos in the Selino province of southwestern Crete. Dated by inscription to 8 August 6965 (1457), the church is a single nave chapel with a barrel-vaulted interior and a saddle roof exterior. An original and painted stone iconostasis with a single archway opening divides the sanctuary from the nave. It includes, to the east, the images of two bishop saints facing the altar, and, to the west, the images of St. Anne holding the Virgin and Christ Pantocrator.
	The sanctuary apse shows the Virgin Platytera, hands outstretched around the image of the Christ child. Below the Virgin, four bishop saints, including St. Cyril of Alexandria and St. Polycarpus, are presented in roundels above the standing images of four co-officiating bishops. The triumphal arch, albeit damaged, includes the scene of the Hospitality of Abraham and the Annunciation. The deacon saints Stephen and Romanus the Melodist flank the altar. The north and south walls of the sanctuary include the images of St. Eleutherius and St. Anthony respectively. 
The nave is divided into two parts by a transverse arch. The barrel vault is decorated with scenes from the life of the Virgin and St. Anne. These include, for the life of the Virgin, the Virgin blessed by priests and the presentation of the Virgin in the temple, and for the life of St. Anne, the prayer of St. Anne, the meeting of Joachim and Anne, and Joachim in the wilderness. 
The niches of the northern wall include, to the east, the Archangel Michael flanked on either side of the niche by St. Anastasia and a male saint. The western niche of the north wall includes the mounted figure of St. George with the small figure of the boy from Mytilene who, according to one of St. George’s posthumous miracles, St. George rescued from captivity. The healing saints Cosmas and Panteleimon, each holding the instruments of their trade, flank St. George on either side of the niche. Between these two niches is a large image of St. Anne feeding the Virgin. 
	Similarly, the niches of the southern wall include, to the east, the standing figures of St. Demetrios and St. Procopius. They are framed on either side of the niche by St. Paraskevi and St. Thecla. The western niche shows three portraits of the donors of the church presenting a representation of the church to Christ. This includes the priest Ioannis, his wife, and the donor Vasilios. Christ can be seen in the upper portion of the niche reaching out his hands in blessing. The niche is flanked on either side by St. Marina and St. Kyriaki. Additional donor portraits can be seen on the westernmost part of both the north and south walls and flanking the entrance to the church on the west wall below the image of the Crucifixion. This includes the donors Michael, on the southern wall, Vasilios on the northern wall, George and his wife to the left of the entrance and Michael and his wife to the right of the entrance. Both couples on the western wall offer representations of the church to Christ. 
	As indicated by the donor portraits, the partially preserved dedicatory inscription notes that the church was built and painted by George, son of Petros, and his wife, Michael, son of Petros, and his wife, and the priest Ioannis and his wife.

1965,"Church of St. Pelagia, Ano Viannos, Heraklion, Crete",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Located in the village of Ano Viannos, south of the capital city of Heraklion, the Church of St. Pelagia is a single nave chapel with a pointed barrel vault interior and saddle roof exterior. The church is whitewashed except for the stone frame decorating the entrance on the southern wall. A framed pointed-arch niche, also whitewashed, rises above the lintel with traces of painting still visible where the stone meets the whitewash. The door frame and niche are undecorated. A transverse arch divides the interior of the church into two bays while a short modern banister divides the sanctuary from the nave. 
	In the sanctuary, although badly damaged by smoke and moisture, the half dome of the apse includes the image of the Virgin Platytera. She is flanked by two angels and extends her hands on either side of the roundel holding an image of the Christ child. The triumphal arch includes the scene of the Hospitality of Abraham in the upper register, the Annunciation on either side and, on the lower register, the images of the deacon St. Stephen on the left and an unidentifiable saint on the right. Behind the altar, four co-officiating bishops flank the Melismos. The Ascension is painted in the vault above the sanctuary. Below the Ascension, on the northern wall, is the image of the Pentecost, while opposite, on the southern wall, is the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple. The lower register of the northern wall of the sanctuary includes the image of the Sacrifice of Abraham (just above the prothesis niche and east of a small window) while the south wall bears the image of an unidentifiable bishop saint next to St. Constantine.
	The barrel vault of the nave, to the east of the transverse arch, has scenes from the Christological cycle including the Anastasis, the Raising of Lazarus, Christ appearing to the two Marys and the Incredulity of Thomas. Additional scenes from the life of Christ as well as the life of St. Pelagia of Jerusalem decorate the barrel vault to the west of the transverse arch. These include, from the life of Christ, images of the Nativity, the Massacre of the Innocents and the Last Supper. From the life of St. Pelagia we have three scenes: St. Pelagia with two figures, St. Pelagia giving her belongings to the poor, and the deacon James visiting Pelagia in her cell. The transverse arch is decorated with the Ten saints of Crete.
	The gallery of saints along the northern wall (to the west of the modern iconostasis) includes the images of St. Mamas, St. Anthony and, unusually, St. Bartholomew holding his skin over his left shoulder. Above the image of St. Bartholomew, who stands directly below the transverse arch, is the image of a cross-legged male figure playing a lute (possibly connected to the life of St. Pelagia). Next to St. Bartholomew are three military saints on horseback. Likewise, the saints on the southern wall include (to the east of the entrance) an unidentifiable female saint, a bishop saint. To the right of the entrance is a large image of St. Christopher carrying the Christ child. 
	The southern wall is decorated with the Crucifixion above and Hell below. Hell includes several frames of individual sinners and compartments of Communal Punishments spread across two registers. The individual sinners are well preserved and are presented in ochre against a white background. Each of the figures has a snake wrapped around them but the inscriptions are, for the most part lost. Of the ones that can be positively identified are: the (livestock) thief, the man who cheats the scales, the cheating tailor, the male and female fornicator, possibly the notary who falsified documents, the usurer, the fortune teller, the female slanderer, the witch and the woman who rejects babies. 
	The dedicatory inscription for the church is located on the upper part of the portal. It notes that the church was built and decorated by Nikole(tos) Maris, his wife Sophia and their children, Kostas Maris, his wife and children, and their mother Eudokia on 1 October 6869 (1360). 
	The church of St. Pelagia is known for its incorporation of several western iconographic elements into the decoration of the church. This includes the image of St. Bartholomew, flayed and carrying his skin (according to the western tradition of his martyrdom), the image of St. Christopher holding the Christ child on his shoulder and the inclusion of the Centurion on horseback and Mary fainting in the scene of the Crucifixion.",1360,2023,2066,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-09-14 23:49:41.542 +0200,2023-09-14 23:49:41.542 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1966,Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O,43,Religious Group (v6),"Aladura is the word for “praying people”. The Aladura churches are independent African churches or African Instituted Churches (AICs) that emphasize prayer and healing. The Aladura Churches reflects the indigenization of Christianity through the use of African symbols, traditional healing modalities, and worship styles. The Aladura Churches offer solutions to existential problems plaguing humans unlike earlier churches whose emphasis is just the afterlife. The Christ Apostolic Church, the Cherubim and Seraphim, the Church of the Lord, and the Celestial Church of Christ have emerged as the significant arms of the Aladura movement.
The Cherubim and Seraphim Church, one of the Aladura churches, was co-founded by Moses Orimolade and Christiana Abiodun Emmanuel in 1925 through the Praying Band, which was then known as Egbe Aladura. Though a praying group in the first two years of its existence, the church was finally named in 1927.
There were different divisions that ravaged the church after the early years of its existence. Many divisions have taken place among the fold of the Cherubim and Seraphim after its first division in 1929 because of the unresolved differences that ensued between the founders. Even though there were many attempts made at uniting the various divided sections of the church, these attempts failed and had brought about many other factions instead. The church has disintegrated into so many factions, which are also having branches of their own. Also, these factions have their own ways of practices and mode of worship that are peculiar to them.
There are many independent brands of the church in and around Nigeria. This crisis situation of the church led to the forming of a body that is intended to reconcile the various factions and to have one unified Cherubim & Seraphim Church. Thus, the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN) was born. The C&SUCN was founded as the body that intends to bring many of the factional bodies of the Cherubim and Society (C&S) together. It was formed in 1972. 
The C&SUCN took off with five (5) mother churches that include: Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim & Seraphim; The Praying Band of the Sacred Society of Cherubim & Seraphim; Cherubim & Seraphim Society; The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Society; and the Holy Order of Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church. The name of the section of the C&S Church, Holy Order of the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, was changed to Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church Worldwide Ayo Ni O.
Today, the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O has 1750 branches, 105 districts, and 35 model church/parishes. The Most Senior Special Apostle Prophet Dr. Abiodun Adewale Abidoye JP was appointed as the Acting Spiritual Father and Chairman of Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church Worldwide Ayo Ni O. The Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O is one of the five streams of churches under the umbrella all the Cherubim & Seraphim churches. 
And the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O, is a significant section of the Cherubim and Seraphim movement which has its tentacles all over the world. The ecclesial practices and theology of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Worldwide Ayo Ni O have the same beliefs and practices in all its branches. Each city especially in Southwest Nigeria has a number of branches of this church. For instance, there are are six (6) identified and well-known branches of the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, Ayo Ni O in Ibadan alone. The church is administered by leaders who operate mostly in the prophetic office. Visions, trances and other forms of divine communication between the divine and humans are encouraged among the membership of the church. This is because the practice encourages members of the church to live with confidence that they have fore knowledge of future events and so they do not live in fear of the unknown.",1972,2023,2075,1509,Samuel Okanlawon,2023-09-15 02:33:24.326 +0200,2024-04-06 15:03:06.361 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1967,The Hermitage of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"On the southern side of the so-called Third Valley (also known as the Valley of the Last Mentuhotep), high on the slopes of an unnamed hill, behind Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, an unfinished mortuary complex of Amenemhat Sehetepibre is located. It includes two tombs, TT 1151 and TT 1152, which were occupied by two Christian hermits, in the last decades of the fifth century. The tombs were used by subsequent generations of monks, until their eventual abandonment in the eighth century. 
It is demonstrated that Tomb TT 1152 was prepared for one of the court officials of the Middle Kingdom in Thebes and it is dated to the end of the Eleventh or the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty. Whereas it was never finished, certain parts of its interior, such as the entrance corridor and the cult chapel were completed. It was repetitively used for sepulchral purposes between the Second Intermediate Period and the beginning of the Late Period. In front of the entrance to the tomb there was an open courtyard, which would have been normally surrounded by a mud-brick wall; however, this wall was never built. In the centre of the rock facade there was the entrance to the tomb leading to a long rock-cut corridor with a square chamber at the end – the funerary cult chapel. In the floor of this chamber, there was an entrance to a deep shaft. Usually, at the bottom of this shaft, there was another corridor leading to the burial chamber. In TT 1152, the burial chamber was never hewn, as work stopped during the preparation of the corridor. 
The monks who occupied the tomb made certain adjustments. They added benches and a ‘bed’, and they decorated the rock walls with crosses, two figures of equestrian saints, Christ and inscriptions using red and yellow colours. At a later stage, in the courtyard in front of the tomb, domestic and industrial facilities as well as an almost 6-metres high mud-brick defensive tower/ keep were constructed. Access to the tower was possible through an upper-floor chamber that was reached using a ladder from the outside.  Thus, it appears that the area outside the hermitage served economic purposes (e.g. craft activities, storage of raw materials for production, preparation of meals). The character of the front part of the interior was rather sacral (place of prayer), but it was also a reception area. The hermitage was probably occupied by two monks, a master and his disciple, who manufactured textiles, baskets and leather artefacts. 
TT 1151 is located 40m north of TT 1152. There, the alterations performed by the monks included plastering of the rock walls and floor covering. In the entrance of the corridor a pavement running 14m was laid. Most of it was a hard lime mortar and some sections at the back were of tamped clay. Just inside the entrance, the floor was composed of small limestone slabs imitating gray-white marble, decorated with a large cross whose outlines were marked with regular pieces of red-brick tiles. The mud plaster coating of the walls was decorated with elaborate geometric motifs, intersecting circles, crosses and inscriptions. Two low masonry benches, separated by a low mud-brick wall, were attached to the eastern wall of the corridor. TT 1151 was used as a place for prayer and worship instead of habitation.
Three manuscripts were retrieved from the rubbish dump. These are very important and rare finds. Two of these manuscripts were books written on papyrus and bound in leather, the covers blind-tooled and decorated. One contained the Canons of Pseudo-Basil and is provisionally dated to the seventh/ eighth century. It is the only full text of these canons in the Coptic language (Sahidic dialect). The cover of the second codex is decorated with a red-painted Chi-Ro sign inside a circle and a guilloche. This book was an Enkomion of St Pisenthios, bishop of Keft (Koptos), who lived in AD 568–632. The third book was a series of 51 loose parchment cards placed among two wooden boards pasted with thin leather. One card bears a text in Greek that is dated to the eighth century. Two others, presumed to be palimpsests, contained passages from chapters 35 and 36 of the apocryphal Acts of St. Peter recounting the martyrdom of the saint. The remaining 48 cards contained some of the final chapters of the Old Testament Book of Isaiah.",480,750,2068,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2023-09-16 16:49:10.925 +0200,2023-09-17 03:55:38.180 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1968,"Church of St. Mamas, Palaiochora, Selino, Crete",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Located a short distance inland from where the Pelekaniotikos River meets the sea just west of Palaiochora, the Church of St. Mamas is a barrel-vaulted structure with a saddle roof exterior. Restored in the 1980s, only the northern wall is original. The church is divided into two bays by a transverse arch. A large modern iconostasis divides the sanctuary from the nave however remnants of the original stone iconostasis can still be seen. 
	In the sanctuary the northern half of the image of Christ Pantocrator is preserved in the half dome of the apse with a partially preserved halo below, likely one of the co-officiating bishops. The triumphal arch includes the image of the Mandylion in the upper register, the Archangel Gabriel from the Annunciation below, and the deacon St. Stephen in the lowest register. The Ascension can still be seen on the northern half of the barrel vault of the sanctuary next to the image of St. Melchizedek. The only remaining full figure on the transverse arch is the standing figure of Aaron who holds a flowering rod in his right hand and a vessel (in the form of the ark of Noah), a horn (typically an attribute of Samuel), and a censer in his left hand. 
	The nave includes only the lower part of the Baptism of Christ and the Transfiguration in the upper register. In the register below are three scenes of the life of St. Mamas. These scenes include an image of St. Mamas praying, St. Mamas at the gates of Caesarea, and the Death of St. Mamas. The lower register includes an image of the enthroned Virgin. She holds the Christ child on her lap and is flanked by two angels. To the west of the Virgin is the image of St. Kyriaki. 
The dedicatory inscription, framed in ochre and barely legible today, is preserved to the west of St. Kyriaki above a decorative band. Based on the photographs of Giuseppe Gerola, the inscription notes that the church was built and decorated by the priest Georgios Saklos (?) and his wife and children, Photinos Abramis and his wife and children, and Georgios Abramis and his wife in 6864 (1355-56). Gerola also notes that the Abramo name can be associated with a Venetian family who settled on the island in 1211.",1355,2023,2069,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2023-09-16 19:19:09.998 +0200,2023-09-16 19:19:09.998 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1969,"Christ Apostolic Church, Ori-Oke Aanun [sic] (Mountain of Mercy), Ojoo, Ibadan, Oyo State",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Prayer Mountains, also known as Ori-Oke (in Yoruba parlance), are centres of spiritual pilgrimage and within the praxis of Nigerian Christian lexicon, are synonymous with the enactment of a sacred space on a mountaintop characterized by various prayer regimes, rituals, exorcism and religious practices, aimed at eliciting the help of the divine to alleviate the existential challenges of devotees who visit these Prayer Mountains from different walks of life, are of the different sexes, and belong to different strata of socio-economic status. The prominent Ori-Oke (Prayer Mountains) of the South Western part of Nigeria are largely concentrated in the Oyo and Osun States of Nigeria.
This entry examines one of the prominent Ori-Oke (Prayer Mountains) in Ibadan, Oyo State, which is the Christ Apostolic Church, Ori-Oke Aanun [sic] located in Ojoo area in Ibadan. The Yoruba word 'Aanu', being the correct spelling of word 'Aanun' as it is being used by the proprietors of the prayer mountain connotes mercy. It therefore suggests that the prayer mountain is a place where people obtain mercy and find solutions to their existential problems. It is one of the prominent Ori-Oke that are largely visited by people who desire solutions to their life crisis and those of their loved ones in Ibadan. Judging by the volume of human traffic that throng these prayer mountains and by the responses of people during a pilot survey in knowing the mostly accessed prayer mountains in the Southwest of Nigeria.  The prominent Prayer Mountains in Ibadan are Ori-Oke Aanun, Ibadan; Ori-Oke Automatic, Ibadan; and Ori-Oke Olorunkole, Ibadan. 
The Ori-Oke Aanun (Mountain of Mercy), Ojoo, Ibadan was founded by Prophet Moses Aladeolu through God's leading. He was led by God's voice to a thick forest after many days of prayer and fasting and through prophetic utterances from his first host in Ibadan. He was a successful contractor to the Oyo State government but was compelled by God to find the unexplored mountain that has become a succour for many seeking divine intervention to their many existential problems. And today, the unexplored forest has become a community thriving with different spiritual, social and economic activities.
People have given various reasons for visiting Prayer Mountains. Some of these include spiritual restoration, soul purification, re-awakening, revivals and healings. Incidentally, some are of the opinion that some problems may not be solved until a visit or more to the mountain is carried out. Some churches or prayer grounds who have no affinity with a prayer mountain might have named their place of gathering Ori-Oke because the term Ori-Oke is synonymous with a place for miracles. However, prayer sites with mountain topography are predominantly found in the South West which many attest to the mountains providing a secluded and serene environment for spiritual exercise. 
Many of those who visit the Prayer Mountains have often given their premise for attaching significance to the Prayer Mountains because Jesus Christ, during his earthly ministry, often visited or retreated to a mountaintop location to commune with God and even taught the crowd of people there at some instances with miracles being recorded. On the other hand too, some have visited some Prayer Mountains for the wrong reasons and became victims of fake prophets. Each Prayer Mountain has its own peculiarity. Hence, this entry looks at the appealing characteristics of Ori-Oke Aanun especially within the context of the prominent Prayer Mountains in Ibadan, Oyo State.",1900,2023,2070,1509,Samuel Okanlawon,2023-09-16 22:19:53.151 +0200,2024-04-03 08:52:28.050 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1970,The Monastery of Saint Phoibammon in the Rock/ Phoibammon I,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Deep in the mountainous desert between the village of Jeme in Western Thebes and the pagarchy capital Hermonthis, lies the monastic settlement that the local inscriptions call the ‘Laura’ or ‘Topos’ of Apa Phoibammon. The place is situated eight kilometres from the Nile and 10 kilometers south of the northern Topos of Apa Phoibammon, on the terraces of Deir el- Bahari, and the Holy Topos of Apa Epiphanius. The monks chose not to settle in the Pharaonic tombs of the necropolis of Western Thebes, but they erected a cluster of buildings at the end of a narrow wadi with an abrupt cliff face, about twenty-five meters high, creating a natural semicircular amphitheater for the settlement.
It is probable that this monastery was built from the beginning on an empty spot and that the unearthed ruins correspond to its initial plan. On the south side, the settlement was enclosed by a group of buildings. A gatehouse in the southeast served as the central entrance to the community. A church (or oratory) was located to the west, after entering the complex. It was paved with stones and housed the barrel vault tomb of a monk, identified as the superior of the community. The walls were plastered with lime and show signs of red dipinti and simple figural paintings. The monastery was equipped with seven circular bread ovens ranging between 0.50 and 1.20 m high. Provisions were stored in food in three silos on the northeast side.
It has been argued that the term ‘laura’ that refers to the small monastery of Phoibammon does not actually designate a conglomerate of autonomous hermitages. Bachatly who excavated the site considered that it was founded as part of the Pachomian federation. Despite the fact that this view has been contested, recent discussions have concluded that a cenobitic community was most likely installed there, while the term ‘laura’ was probably introduced by someone from Palestine or Syria. 
Based on ceramic evidence, the settlement was inhabited in the fourth century. It was at least partially abandoned by the end of the sixth or the beginning of the seventh century, probably due to rockfalls from the mountain that the buildings were attached. However, such a catastrophic event remains just a hypothesis. It is known that Patriarch Damian asked Abraham who used to be the oikonomos of the monastery to move in a less isolated place. As a result of this request, Abraham founded the cenobitic Monastery of Saint Phoibammon (Phoibammon II) in the ruins of the Hatshepsut temple in Deir el-Bahari.",350,600,2071,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2023-09-17 22:23:18.027 +0200,2023-09-17 23:49:55.590 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1971,The Homeric Hymn to Demeter,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Homeric Hymn to Demeter is one of 33 surviving ancient Greek hymns traditionally attributed to Homer (though modern scholars no longer believe that any of the Hymns were composed by the composer or composers of the Iliad and the Odyssey). The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (sequentially the second of the Homeric Hymns) is 495 lines long, making it one of the longest Homeric Hymns. The Hymn to Demeter uses a language and style that is particularly close to that found in the Homeric and Hesiodic epics, so it is usually argued that the Hymn was composed not long after these epics, perhaps between the late seventh century and the middle of the sixth century BCE. The Hymn describes the abduction of Demeter's daughter Penelope by Hades, the ruler of the underworld, and Demeter's subsequent attempt to retrieve her daughter. The Hymn also presents a mythical account for the origins of the Mysteries of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis.",-600,-550,588,841,Avi Kapach,2023-09-20 14:28:40.388 +0200,2023-09-22 14:50:03.912 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1972,Shepherding Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Shepherding Movement, aka Christian Growth Movement, was a sub movement within the larger Charismatic Movement during the 1970s and 1980s. It was founded by a group of US pastors dubbed the “Fort Lauderdale Five:” Don Basham, Bob Mumford, Derek Prince, Charles Simpson, and Ern Baxter. Believing that current churches and pastors were losing sight of the value of discipleship and were caving to worldly practices and cultures, the movement emphasized personal accountability and mentorship where adherents would submit themselves to a “shepherd.” Leaders in the movement required participants to attend additional life group meetings, usually in someone’s home, and to have shepherds, leaders, and elders approve all life decisions, including but not limited to: marriage, where to live, taking a new job or leaving a current job, or going to the doctor if ill. 
As the Shepherding Movement expanded throughout the United States, networks of communities began to emerge in the shape of a pyramid structure. The networks would meet locally in cell churches. Shepherds would have multiple disciples under them, and those shepherds would be under the authority of shepherds above them. These relationships became known as “covenant relationships” and the disciple was required to submit in all areas of life and tithe directly to the shepherd who would move the money up the authoritative structure. 
Leaders in the Pentecostal and Charismatic communities began to scrutinize the Shepherding Movement as the movement continued to grow and gain influence. Concerns about tithing to shepherds and the rigid structures of submission and of the covenant relationships were articulated by various pastors throughout the nation. Nationally recognized leaders such as Pat Robertson, Kathryn Khulman, and Demos Shakarian denounced the movement and distanced themselves from the founding leaders. 
By the 1980s, the movement began to fracture as the unity of the leaders disintegrated. Derek Prince and Bob Mumford publicly disassociated from the movement. In 1983, Derek Prince stated that the movement was an error. Bob Mumford publicly asked for forgiveness for his role in the movement in 1989. The movement waned during the 1990s and into the early 2000s as more adherents left the movement citing abuses from leadership. Due to the breakup of the founding leaders, there is little information as to how many adherents remain.",1970,2000,1131,762,Nathan Womack,2023-09-20 23:56:06.385 +0200,2023-10-06 00:52:06.713 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1973,The Homeric Hymn to Apollo,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Homeric Hymn to Apollo (Homeric Hymn 3) is one of 33 ancient Greek hymns that were traditionally attributed to Homer, the semi-legendary composer of the Iliad and Odyssey. Today, scholars no longer believe that the Homeric Hymns were composed by the composer or composers of the Iliad and Odysseus, though the hymns do have important stylistic, narrative, and thematic affinities with the epics, by which they were probably partly inspired. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo one of the longer Homeric Hymns. Many scholars have argued that this hymn was originally two separate hymns, namely, a hymn to Delian Apollo that describes the origins and birth of the god on the island of Delos,  and a hymn to Pythian Apollo describing how the god took charge of the oracle at Delphi. Others, however, have argued that the hymn was a unified composition. The archaic language of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, particularly the first part of the hymn (the hymn to ""Delian Apollo"") has led scholars to argue for an early date of composition, perhaps as early as the middle of the seventh century BCE; the second part of the hymn (the hymn to ""Pythian Apollo""), may have been composed later, in the early sixth century BCE. Walter Burkert has made the argument that the two parts of the hymn were first brought together in 523/22 BCE for a festival that the tyrant Polycrates of Samos celebrated on Delos (in accordance with instructions from an oracle, the festival would have honored both Delian and Pythian Apollo, and would have thus been an appropriate occasion for the unification of the two hymns if they were indeed originally separate).",-655,-522,588,841,Avi Kapach,2023-09-21 15:29:26.189 +0200,2023-09-21 15:29:26.189 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1974,"Chapel of Grace, Ile-Ife",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Chapel of Grace, Ile-Ife started as a fellowship of Christian staff of the University of Ife Teaching Hospital now The Chapel of Grace, Ile-Ife started as a fellowship of Christian staff of the University of Ife Teaching Hospital now Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife. A group of the members of staff of the Teaching Hospital who began to meet to share their Christian faith and conviction decided to organise themselves into a fellowship in the late 1980s. In the early days of the fellowship, they got the leave of the hospital management to meet at a suitable venue within the engineering yard of the Ife hospital unit. From this venue they moved to their permanent site about fifty meters from the second gate of the Ife hospital unit of the hospital.

The church is led by a church council comprising of the senior pastor, other pastors, members of the deaconate, leaders of the various arms of the church as well as other eminent members of the Christian community in Ile-Ife. The council meets annually or when it becomes necessary to take important decisions for the progress of the church. Next to the church council is the pastoral board which meets more regularly to plan the activities of the church and provide leadership for the members. There are several activity groups within the church which members are encouraged to join to achieve the set goals for which the ministry was started.

Membership of the church comprises mainly of the working population of the hospital. The nature of the hospital is such that many of the staff undertake various training programmes to specialise in their desired field of medical and health practice. Many of these individuals worship at the Chapel of Grace during their training and relocate to other towns and cities to settle and practice as professionals. The church has had a highly mobile population over the years. Although several staff settle in permanent jobs in the hospital and continue in the church. They are joined by others who work outside the hospital community but are delighted to identify with the church. The church’s most celebrated annual programme is the ‘‘Power in the Word Conference’’. It is a programme where the word of God (the bible) is dissected and taught passionately. 

Other annual programmes which the church holds include Choir Anniversary, Blissful Home Seminar, a carol at Christmas and special programmes for children, youths, men and women respectively. Aside the annual programmes, the church meets every Sunday for the Sunday worship service and on Wednesday (weekly programme for bible exposition/teaching and prayers). The church holds a prayer vigil on the last Friday of the month as well as a prayer meeting before the commencement of work every Monday morning.

1975,Monastery of Panagia (Virgin) Soumela,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Imperial, Patriarchal and Stauropegial Monastery of Panagia Soumela (meaning “of black (mountain)"" in Greek) is located on the western slopes of Mount Melas, in the Maçka district of Trebizond province in modern Turkey. The tradition places its foundation to the 4th century and attributes its establishment to two Athenian monks, Barnabas and Sophronios, who supposedly discovered in a cave an icon of the Virgin, said to have been painted by Saint Luke.
During its long history, the Monastery was destroyed and restored several times. During the 6th century, it was restored and enlarged by the Byzantine general Belissarius at the behest of emperor Justinian. It reached its current form in the 13th century, but it prospered during the reign of Alexios III Komnenos (1349‑1390) who has restored the Monastery between 1360 and 1365 and endowed it with hereditary lands and dependents, listed in the chrysobull issued in 1364. Moreover, he exempted the Monastery from all taxes (except for one biannual tax), while it restored to it the paroikoi (serfs), illegally taken from it. During the reigns of subsequent princes and rulers, Soumela gained further wealth from imperial grants. After the conquest of Trebizond by Sultan Mehmed II in 1461, the Monastery was granted his protection and given rights and privileges, which were subsequently renewed. 
Following the exchange of Greek and Turkish population (treaty of Lausanne) in 1923, Soumela Monastery was abandoned. In 1930 its wooden parts were destroyed by fire and in the following years other parts were damaged and pillaged. Some of its relics and treasures were transferred to the homonymous new Monastery founded in 1930 on Mount Vermion near Naousa, in Macedonia, Greece. The Monastery is currently a museum open to visitors. On the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos (15 August) in 2010, Orthodox divine liturgy by the Oecumenical Patriarch was allowed to take place at the Monastery.
The main grotto church (katholikon) is surrounded by nine chapels. In the 1970s another frescoed chapel was discovered to the north of the monastic complex. Its frescoes were dated to the 12th century. The frescoes of the katholikon date from the 12th to the 18th century. The oldest frescoes of the entire monastic complex of Soumela are the two medallions with the Virgin and Christ on the north side and a depiction of Archangel Gabriel on the south side of the ceiling of the main grotto church. The iconographic programme contains as well portraits of the Trapezuntine emperors Alexios III and Emmanuel III Komnenos (east part of the south wall), most probably painted in the very beginning of the 15th century. Most of the frescoes that decorate the monastic complex date after 1461 and they belong to four different phases (i. 16th century; ii. 1710; iii. 1732; 18th century). Only the following four out of the nine chapels have painted decoration: i. chapel to the east of the main church; ii. chapel partially carved into the rock, behind the newer structure; iii. chapel above the main church; and, iv. chapel to the east of the destroyed bell tower.
The Monastery of Panagia Soumela was submitted as a possible UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 and is currently listed on the Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.",375,2023,2073,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-09-23 16:00:00.386 +0200,2023-09-28 14:56:06.293 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1976,Who is not assisted by the religious scholar(The Jurist) (Man La Yahdhuruhu al-Faqih) من لا يحضره الفقيه,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This Book is included in the four major books of the traditions of Shi'ite Islam. Despite the fact that many

1978,"The Dharmalakshana Buddhist Institute 佛教法相學會, Hong Kong",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Dharmalakshana Buddhist Institute is a Hong Kong Buddhist organization chiefly found by the famous Buddhist layman and scholar Lo Shi-hin 羅時憲 (1914 – 1993) in 1965. The aims of the Institute are to promote Yogācāra thought, a section of Mahāyāna Buddhism that it emphasizes the importance of philosophical argument in the process of reaching Buddhahood, and to improve the quality of the Buddhism in Chinese society through the learning of Yogācāra thought. There was, in fact, a unique background of the foundation of the Institute. Since the early 20th century, the Buddhism in China, the thoughts of Pure Land 淨土and Chan 禪 in particular, was severely criticized as superstitious, conservative and passive, as related thoughts were believed to ignore such society-relevant issues as poverty and inequality, but only paid attention to the obtainment of a quiet and pure mind. As a result, the Buddhist in China in that time was considered ignorant to the world and it made the future of the Buddhism there pessimistic. In order to prevent the Buddhism in China from further deteriorating, individual Buddhist figures such as Taixu 太虛 (1890 – 1947) and Ouyang Jian 歐陽漸(1871 – 1943) tried to promote the thought of Yogācāra, as the thought is regarded as highly scientific, argumentative and even earthly, and through the learning of it, the situation of the Buddhism in China could be eventually improved. As the political conditions got worse since 1930s, however, the suggestion of Taixu and Ouyang Jian failed, and it is widely held that the movement of promoting Yogācāra thought in China came to an end in the late 1940s. Beyond all expectations, Lo Shi-hin, a disciple of Taixu and an admirer of Ouyang Jian, left mainland China and arrived Hong Kong in 1949, and recommended Yogācāra thought in the British colony. From 1954 to 1965, Lo Shi-hin taught Ch'eng Wei-Shih Lun 成唯識論, the Yogācāra classic translated and edited by Xuanzang 玄奘 (602 – 664) and Kuījī 窺基 (632 – 682), in a local Buddhist society, and the teaching became a landmark of a continuation of the wills of Taixu and Ouyang Jian. After the completion of the teaching, Lo Shi-hin, together with other 13 disciples including Wei Tat (韋達), Lee Yun Sang (李潤生) and Huo Tao Hui (霍韜晦), founded the Dharmalakshana Buddhist Institute, aiming to promote Yogācāra thought in a more systematic way. Since then, the Institute, on the one hand, keeps teaching the Yogācāra thought especially those as inherited by Xuanzang, while, on the other hand, helps improve the arguments of such traditional Chinese Buddhist thoughts as Pure Land, Tiantai 天台, Huayan 華嚴 and Chan. The Dharmalakshana Buddhist Institute is probably the only Buddhist organization in Chinese society who actively promotes the thought of Yogācāra now, and most of the Yogācāra works from the line of Xuanzang have been discussed by the members of the Institute. Many of their interpretations have also been published. To a large extent, the movement of promoting Yogācāra thought as happened in the early Republican China has not ended but is ongoing in Hong Kong. This important intellectual movement is certainly worth our further attention.",1965,2023,2077,1471,King Pong Chiu,2023-09-26 11:23:31.749 +0200,2023-10-03 21:46:39.826 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Though the Hymn to Hermes, like the other Homeric Hymns, has important stylistic, narrative, and thematic similarities to the Iliad and Odyssey, modern scholars do not believe that these poems were composed by the composer or composers of the Iliad and Odyssey. The Homeric Hymn to Hermes narrates the first three days of the life of Hermes, the Greek god associated with messengers, travel, and thieves. In the hymn, the young Hermes invents the lyre, steals the cattle of his brother Apollo, and finally receives a ""crash course"" in divination. Music and song are important themes throughout, and humor is used very prominently.

1980,Cultic Practice at Khirbet Qeiyafa,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Khirbet Qeiyafa (ancient name unknown) is a fortified site overlooking the Elah Valley in hilly Shephelah region of the modern State of Israel. The site’s main period of occupation was at the very beginning of the local Iron Age IIA, placed with the aid of radiocarbon dates c. 1020-980 BCE. There is some evidence for earlier occupation in the Middle Bronze Age and also limited occupation during the Hellenistic and Byzantine periods. On the basis of its geographical location, the site was most likely affiliated with the tribe of Judah and an early Israelite kingdom based on the highlands to the east, guarding one route that could be used by the Philistines to invade. N.B., the political history and archaeology of this period is extensively debated, and a social or political affiliation of the site is likewise a complex issue.
The site’s Iron Age IIA occupants appear to have rapidly abandoned the site and left much of what they had there behind, hence the site’s material culture and extensively preserved. This includes spaces and objects that have been associated by the excavators with cultic activities, hence the site’s relevance to research on religion in the southern Levant during the Iron Age.
The primary loci of cultic activities were three separate spaces spread throughout the site that appear to have been used (exclusively or not) for cult, interpreted as such by the excavators on the basis of fixed and portable finds. Room G of Building C3 contained a stone bench, the opening of a drain apparently for liquids, a limestone basin, two stone-built installations of unclear purpose, two standing stones and a nearby flat stone interpreted as an offering table, a worked basalt altar of portable size, and a libation vessel with two rounded cups set on a tall base. In Courtyard E of Building C10 contained a basin above a drain, half of a basalt altar and fragments of a fenestrated ceramic stand. The adjacent Room F contained a unique type of cup-and-saucer vessel (much larger than any other excavated example from any site), while the adjacent Room G contained a bench and drain, a square stone platform (not fully preserved) and portable models, one stone and one ceramic, that appear to show the entrance of a temple. Fragments of both another ceramic model and a large cup-and-saucer vessel were found in other rooms of this building. Room A of Building D100 contained another twin-cup libation vessel, and one standing stone, as well as another possible standing stone, were found in adjacent rooms. A standing stone and bronze cup may also indicate a cultic space in the plaza of the site’s southern gate complex. Other objects found throughout the site’s Iron Age occupation, including an anthropomorphic figurine head, zoomorphic vessels, and chalices could be related to cultic activity.",-1020,-980,2091,1467,Zachary Thomas,2023-10-02 07:14:43.166 +0200,2023-10-07 01:07:17.624 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

1982,Guodian Laozi 郭店老子,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Guodian Laozi 郭店老子 is the name given to three manuscripts inked on bamboo found during the 1993 archaeological excavation at Tomb No. 1 of the Guodian 郭店 Tombs near Jingmen 荊門, Hubei Province 湖北. These three manuscripts and the others (18 in total) found in the same tomb have been dated around the final phase of the Warring States period (453-222 BCE), approximately around 300 BCE.
These three manuscripts, labeled as Manuscript A (jia 甲), B (yi 乙), and C (bing丙), constitute the very first edition found to date of material pertaining to the textual tradition of the Daodejing 道德經 (“Classic of the Way and Virtue”), predating by more than a century the two silk manuscripts (Boshuben 帛書本) found at Mawangdui 馬王堆 in 1973.
The Laozi scrolls, along with the Ziyi 緇衣 and the Wuxing 五行, represent the only manuscripts related to already known texts found within the tomb: all other manuscripts were unknown until their discovery at Guodian.
The three scrolls are distinguished by different handwriting and bamboo strips, and in total they comprise around one third of the transmitted Daodejing (about 1750 characters), presenting variations from the transmitted text in the lexicon, in the division into chapters, and furthermore they lack the canonical division into the Daojing 道經 (Classic of the Way) and Dejing 德經 (Classic of the Virtue) sections. Furthermore, the three scrolls vary greatly in length from one another. Laozi A is inked on 39 bamboo strips (32.3 cm in length), B is inked on 18 strips (30.6 cm), and C is inked on 14 strips (26.5 cm). It also needs to be noted that scroll C has identical bamboo strip length, binding marks, and handwriting from another text, that the editors of the Guodian Chumu Zhujian 郭店楚墓竹簡 (The Bamboo Manuscripts from the Chu Tomb at Guodian) entitled Taiyi sheng shui 太一生水: originally, the two texts were possibly bound together. The three bundles present only one duplication among them: in fact, the second half of received chapter 64 occurs both in bundle A and bundle C, despite presenting major variations in the two occurrences. The repetition of this passage in two scrolls, together with the division into three different scrolls of material closely related to the textual tradition of the Daodejing, and the possible coexistence of another manuscript (the Taiyi sheng shui) within the same scroll with Laozi C, suggest the possibility that, at the time of their burial around the end of the 4th century BCE, the three bundles were not perceived as forming one coherent text.
Content-wise, with the only exception of the 14 bamboo strips that constitute the Taiyi sheng shui, all the material inked on the three scrolls can be traced to the transmitted Daodejing, with variations both in word choice and in the order of the passages. Most of the word variations are orthographic or homophonic, yet there are few instances in which the variations lead to significant change in meaning. Above all, in Laozi A, passage 1, which corresponds to the received chapter 19: the so-called Confucian virtues (sheng 聖, sagacity; zhi 智, knowledge; ren 仁, benevolence; yi 義, propriety) are not criticized as in its received counterpart. 
The questions whether these scrolls represented an older or original edition of the Laozi, or a selection from a larger corpus of textual material, or even separate texts not yet perceived as a coherent whole is still open to debate. But certainly, the Guodian archaeological find has predated to 300 BCE the existence of at least the philosophical core of the Daodejing. 
The themes covered within the three scrolls seem to overlap, so it seems unlikely that the three separate scrolls represent selections made from a single text based on a thematic choice. One example among all, the theme of non-action (either wuwei 無為 or wangwei 亡為 on bamboo) is present and central in all three scrolls. In particular, the person of the shengren 聖人 in the Guodian Laozi is throughout connected to the principle of non-action: the adherence to this principle appears as a crucial requirement for a person to be considered wise. The shengren is described as a person characterized by the lack of desires and by the attitude of avoiding purposeful action: in the bamboo text, not only wangwei appears eight times, but every occurrence of the word shengren is connoted by sentences with negative structure, that is, through the use of wu 無, wang 亡 or bu 不, that invoke wuwei.",-350,-300,1175,1195,Francesca Puglia,2023-10-05 18:59:19.810 +0200,2023-10-12 11:05:13.128 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1983,Early Byzantine Asceticism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Holy men (θεῖος ἀνήρ, also called men, servants, friends or devotees of God) emerged in the East as early as Late Antiquity and the Early Byzantine period. These were individuals that were thought to have been specifically chosen by God so as to spread his word and make him and his intentions present and evident to their contemporaries. In order to come closer to him and gain virtue and purity, holy men abandoned their previous life and practiced repentance and self-mortification through prayer and ascetic labour. 

As they needed to be undistracted to achieve this intimacy with God, holy men withdrew in isolation and lived in social disengagement. This explains their emergence mostly in Syria, due to the area’s geography and climate. In the Syrian desert, as opposed to that of Egypt, these ascetics had the chance to dissociate themselves from the rest of the world and, at the same time, to survive in a relatively “friendly” environment, where they could more easily find adequate sources such as water and roots, even if they had to constantly be on the move. Consequently, they were able to completely cut themselves off from civilisation, while in the harsher landscape of Egypt they would have to carry with them, and then replicate, the well-known practices and habits of the nearby villages, making the contrast between the two worlds (that in a settled land and that in isolation) less apparent. So holy men left their cities, donated their possessions (which sometimes were many as some of them came from relatively wealthy families) to the poor, cut all ties with, and obligations towards, society, and started a new life without the support of family or friends. In addition, having reached a point where they did not have the same needs as other, “ordinary”, people even on a physical level, they also managed to live in the open or sometimes in natural shelters in the desert and other barren or abandoned places, fasting or eating only raw vegetables and roots, and, for long periods, staying sleepless and often with no clothes except for a simple shirt. Following this way of life was of course not always easy, and they had to strive in order to complete their mission. During their isolation, they spent their time praying, trying to support themselves by the work of their hands, exercising their body and trying to control the elements of nature as well as their own bodies and passions through hard training (askesis), mortification and voluntary suffering, which can be seen as imitating the passion of Christ, in an attempt to rise above their human existence. It should be noted, however, that holy men did not consider the body itself to be evil, and what they tried to overcome and work against were the human weaknesses. Finally, although not usually mentioned in our sources, the lives of some of them must have been seriously threatened and even lost while practicing asceticism. A substitute death, such as living in a grave-like enclosed space, nonetheless, was a sign of holiness and the ultimate proof that the holy man was now something more than an “ordinary” person and had moved beyond the normal human condition.   

Although holy men started their askesis by contemplating in isolation, the crowd played a significant part in their lives. Many people would follow them, become their disciples and often form groups or even structured communities with permanent facilities around them, while others would travel long distances to visit them as pilgrims and ask for their help. Ascetics themselves also paid visits to each other and sometimes to nearby villages or cities where they offered their help and, if necessary, they could get a few supplies in exchange for simple repairs. Furthermore, some of them were often asked by the official church to take on positions in the church hierarchy, which they seldom did and only temporarily. Holy men were always ready to participate in the daily life of common people and the social elite in order to protect and integrate that life. However, it was not uncommon for people to be suspicious of them and accuse them of fraud, sorcery and other serious crimes (e.g. murder), even of woes that the community would face in periods of crisis, and holy men had to try to allay them.

The crowd was an essential element in holy men’s lives for an additional reason. Despite their initial withdrawal from the society, after achieving sanctity they had to display signs of it, and the people were the audience they needed in order to exhibit their supernatural powers, as well as those who watched them closely, since they in fact expected to see the evidence that would prove the ascetics’ holiness. Moreover, since holy men sometimes depended on patrons and their gifts and donations, they had to perform miracles for their sake when they were asked to do so. Hagiographers used to place much emphasis on specific incidents from their protagonists’ lives in order to show their powers, such as blessing and cursing, praying or successfully interceding on behalf of their fellow citizens or even strangers who would ask for their help, and the power of prophecy. The most common sign, however, was that of healing, as holy men were thought to possess the ability to cure a variety of illnesses, both mental and physical. Most of the times they would pray for the sick person or visit them and cure them by touching them, while on other occasions they could send them one of their objects, which had acquired its owner’s supernatural powers. Furthermore, as many such stories were based on that of Christ from the Gospels, occasionally holy men were presented as bringing a dead person back to life. The relation between the two can also be seen in the second most often proof of the ascetics’ holiness, the conflict with devil. Holy men constantly had to deal with demons who stood in their way, and often had to heal people who had been possessed by such creatures by performing exorcisms. Their victory over these powers was certain, as they “represented” God, who had given them the ability to handle situations like that. The same is true for encounters with devil himself, who wanted to tempt holy men, distract them from their duties and prevent them from following an ascetic lifestyle. Usually he would do so by reminding them of their previous life they had left behind and all the sacrifices they had made, but the holy men were strong enough to resist him and, eventually, defeat him. 

Lastly, one should briefly also mention the role holy men played in society. The Syrian villages where they first emerged were, at the time, experiencing a decomposition of certain social institutions and a crisis of leadership, and were thus in need of a figure of authority. Therefore, for their inhabitants, holy men assumed the role of powerful rural patrons who would assist them in various aspects of their lives, both in everyday problems and in periods of crisis, while, at the same time, they were more accessible to them than actual patrons. As strangers who were not in any way related to the locals, they also played the role of objective mediators in rural life and sometimes even that of advisors, who reconciled and counselled villagers. Being at the centre of a prayer community as their spiritual fathers, they also offered petitions to God on their behalf, and these people, taking the holy men’s ascetic lifestyle into account, were assured that the latter were close to God and he would therefore hear their prayers. Of course holy men were also considered to be representatives of God, and were thus famous amongst people both in the countryside and in the cities, where they often acquired wealthy patrons themselves. These officials, members of the court or the army and even emperors, assisted and supported them in any way possible and contributed to the rise of their reputation, in exchange for the ascetics’ spiritual guidance and intercession with God. This relationship, as well as the one between holy men and the church authority, was not usually sought after by holy men themselves, who did not accept any offices. However, they gradually moved closer to the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and therefore they also started moving to Constantinople. Finally, it seems that sometimes holy men could work against authorities, namely the emperors, if the latter were usurpers or heretics, in which case the ascetics were regarded as a symbol of opposition to any kind of heresy. In any case, by overcoming their human existence and reaching the apogee of Christian morality, they soon became well-known and an essential part of everyday life in the Byzantine Empire.",400,600,2092,1383,PHOEBE GEORGIADI,2023-10-05 21:35:22.632 +0200,2023-10-11 21:10:59.474 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1984,Monastery of Panagia (Virgin) Chozoviotissa,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastery of Panagia (Virgin) Chozoviotissa on the south of Amorgos sits on the side of a cliff overlooking the Aegean Sea, 2 km away from the Chora, the main settlement of the island. It operates as a male Monastery and officially celebrates the feast of the Entrance of the Virgin Mary to the Temple (Eisodia tis Theotokou in Greek) on November 21.
The Monastery’s name comes from the corruption of “Hozivitissa” or “Kozivitissa”, which in turn is a corruption of the toponym “Hozeva” or “Koziva” in the Holy Land (present day Wadi Qilt, Jericho, Palestine), where important Orthodox Monasteries have existed since the early Christian period. According to local/oral tradition, the icon of Panagia Chozoviotissa arrived during the period of Iconoclasm by the sea at the bay of saint Anna, located near the place where the Monastery was built. The correlation of the oral tradition with the information provided by the Byzantine chroniclers, mainly Theophanes, historical events, as well as later written evidence handed down by manuscripts and the Patriarchal sigillia of the Monastery, allow to date the initial building core to the second half of the 9th century, so in the years that have followed the discovery of the icon of the Virgin. The emperor Alexios I Komnenos has restored the Monastery in 1088, which was also conferred the right of stauropegion, i.e. to be self‑governed and independent from local ecclesiastical hierarchy. During the Venetian occupation of the island (1296-1537) significant changes and expansions were made to the initial building. The Monastery continued to prosper during the Ottoman period (1537-1824). Throughout its long history it was granted lands on the islands of Crete, Leros, Naxos, Paros, Astypalaia, Ios as well as hermitages in Keros, Nikouria, and Grambussa.
The complex which has eight floors is 40m long, while its width does not exceed 5m. The floors are connected by narrow stone staircases, built or carved into the rock. The labyrinthic interior of the structure is characterized by the many arches (byzantine, gothic etc.) and frames built by different materials. The cells of the monks, the refectory, the kitchen, the warehouses, the cisterns, the wells etc. were carved into the rock. In the small vaulted church (katholikon) of the Monastery can be found the two icons of the Virgin Chozoviotissa, and the chisel of the builder through which he was indicated the place where the Virgin wanted the Monastery to be constructed. Another important relic related to the history of the Monastery is the silver hexapterygon (ceremonial fan used in Eastern Christian worship) which has an inscription indicating that the Monastery was restored by emperor Alexios I Komnenos.
The space behind the entrance of the Monastery currently houses an exhibition of relics and artefacts such as liturgical vessels, reliquaries, inscriptions, manuscripts, liturgical vestments, icons, wooden carvings and Early modern books.",850,2023,2093,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-10-07 12:07:23.838 +0200,2023-11-01 17:05:37.386 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1985,Christianity in Antioch. From the Apostolic Era to the Islamic conquest,43,Religious Group (v6),"Antioch has been one of the great centers of Christianity since the times of the New Testament. The origins of Christianity in the city dates from the time of the Apostles. Antioch is mentioned in the Book of Acts (11:26), as the city that the followers of Christ were first ironically referred to as “Christians”. In the Book of Acts, which offers an account of the first years of the Church, Antioch is the second most frequently mentioned city. One of the original seven deacons, Nicholas, was a convert from Antioch and perhaps the first Christian from that city (Acts 6:5). During the persecution which led to the death of St Stephen the First Martyr, members of the fledgling Christian community in Jerusalem fled to Antioch for refuge. According to the tradition of the Church, the See of Antioch was founded by St Peter in 34 CE (mentioned in the Book of Acts, 2:26). Peter was either followed or joined by the Apostles Paul and Barnabas, who preached there to both gentiles and Jews, who seem to have been numerous in the city. It was in Antioch that one of the first conflicts within the newly-founded Church developed between Peter and Paul, regarding the necessity of circumcision for male gentile converts to Christianity. The resolution of this conflict, at the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem in 48-50 CE, determined the direction of the Antiochian mission to the gentiles. It was from Antioch, after all, that Paul and Barnabas departed for their first and their second missionary journeys, in 48 CE from Antioch to Cyprus, Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe; and in 51 CE from Antioch to Cilicia, Lycaonia, Galatia, Troas, Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth. After spending almost seven years in Antioch, St Peter left for Rome. He was succeeded by Euodius, one of the 72 disciples of Christ, who is thus counted in early episcopal lists as the first successor to the Antiochian Throne of Peter. The See of Antioch produced several important personalities, such as St Ignatius of Antioch, the second successor to Peter, a victorious martyr during the reign of Emperor Trajan and an invaluable historical source for the structure of Church life. His Epistles, written en route to his martyrdom in Rome, bear abundant testimony to the nature of the early hierarchical structure of the Church and to general Church order. In addition to Ignatius, mention must be made of the works of Theophilus (169-182 CE), the sixth successor to Peter, who defended Christian doctrine in his writings against heretics and pagans. At the beginning of the fifth century the Patriarchate of Antioch held ecclesiastical hegemony over a large area including Cyprus, Syria, Palestine, Arabia and Mesopotamia. Though still under some Antiochian influence, the Churches of Georgia and Persia were granted ecclesiastical independence by their Mother Church of Antioch. Antioch could not, however, long hold on to this prestigious position and would lose much to the doctrinal conflicts which either originated there or had as their authors men from the Patriarchate of Antioch. In the fifth century the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius, originated from Antioch, was condemned at the Council of Ephesus (431) for his heretical teachings. Despite this condemnation, many Christians in Persia and the East refused to accept it and broke from Orthodoxy by establishing the Nestorian or Assyrian Church. Furthermore, and during the same century, the Monophysite heresy, whose leading opponent was Saint Cyril of Alexandria, gained a foothold in Syria from where many of its leading and most respected proponents came. The monophysite heresy was condemned at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. However, as in the case of Nestorianism, many Christians including a number of Antiochians refused to accept this condemnation. The subsequent establishment of a Monophysite hierarchy (Jacobite) in the sixth century weakened the See of Antioch. At this same time the geographical extent of the Patriarchate was reduced by decisions of the Ecumenical Councils. In 431 the Church of Cyprus was granted independence from Antioch, and in 451 the Patriarchate of Jerusalem was established and given jurisdiction of Palestine and Arabia. In the early seventh century the Byzantine Empire was threatened by the Persians in the East. In an attempt to reconcile the Orthodox and the Jacobite Monophysites to provide a united front against the invaders, Byzantine Emperor Heraclius proposed the compromise doctrine of Monothelitism. However the Orthodox would accept no political compromise when it came to matters of the Faith and at the Council of Constantinople in 680 Monothelitism was rejected as heresy. Very quickly thereafter Monothelitism died out, except at the Antiochian monastery of Beit-Maroon on the Orontes River (the supporters of this heresy became known as Maronites). These three schisms along with the geographical reduction of the Patriarchate of Antioch reduced the See from its former prestige. The city of Antioch and the Patriarchate continued its decline as the administrative center of Eastern Christianity when it suffered a series of earthquakes, attacks and occupations by hostile cultural and religious elements. The city was captured and ravaged by the Persians in 538-540 and again in 611. After the Byzantine recovery of the area and the defeat of the Persians under Emperor Heraclius, Islam arose as a long range religiously motivated threat to the Christian Byzantine Empire. Antioch was one of the first victories of the advancing wave of Islam, falling in 638.",34,638,2094,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-10-08 08:02:23.656 +0200,2023-10-08 11:16:52.612 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1987,Grand Papyrus Magique (PGM IV),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The ""Grand Papyrus Magique"" is the most extensive ancient Greek magic book preserved today. Among the Greek magical papyri it is listed as ""PGM IV"". 

The book consists of 36 now lose papyrus sheets providing 72 pages for inscription. Of these 72 pages 66 were inscribed and six were left blank. Apart from Greek, some shorter texts were written in Egyptian Coptic. 

The manual contains over 50 individual sections with the majority of the content being ritual instructions. But the compiler included additional information, like a prayer that can be used in various rituals, astrological data, information about the picking of plants, and a salutation.

The ritual instructions cover most of the common topics for which people went to see a magician or magicians were concerned with for themselves: Divination, love, gaining favour and friends, being successful in a business, restraining anger, and driving out demons. What is missing in PGM IV is medical magic. 

Unlike modern books, the page width of PGM IV is quite narrow and varies between just 9.5 and 13 cm. The page hight measures between 27 and 30.5 cm and is close to the hight of our standard A4 paper size.

The book is believed to originate from Thebes in Egypt, but it was purchased at an auction in Paris in 1857 and previously belonged to the then Swedish consul in Alexandria named D'Anastasy, who was also a dealer in antiquities. The main reason PGM IV is believed to come from Thebes is because Anastasi claimed in a letter that the papyrus belonged to a group of papyri that were found there.

The papyrus book is dated to the fourth century and kept in Paris at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France with the inventory number ""P. supplemément grec 574"".",4,4,1955,1392,Kirsten Dzwiza,2023-10-08 11:59:41.117 +0200,2023-11-15 16:53:32.063 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1989,Iron Age Celtic Spain and Portugal (Celtiberia),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry pertains to Celtic language-speaking population groups in the Iberian peninsula, coterminous with modern-day Spain and Portugal. We know about the presence of Celtic tribes in the region from Classical writers, as well as linguistic research which provides us with a rich body of evidence. This consists of inscriptions, dedications, contracts etc., dating to the last three centuries BCE.

Additionally, there is evidence from place names, which are particularly helpful in distinguishing between Celtic-speaking peoples and those speaking other languages in and around the region. Archaeological evidence pertaining to settlement, burial, weapons, costumes and pottery also help us distinguish between Celtiberian culture and other Iron Age cultures of Spain and Portugal.

Settlement features included both round and rectangular houses, as well as fortified settlements with thick walls. Depending upon region and geography, the economy included herding and a variety of agricultural strategies based on the local environment. There were extensive cremation cemeteries, as well as round graves covered by cairns of stones.  Evidence of metallurgy exists in some areas, and grave goods included personal items, ornaments, and weapons of bronze and iron.

In terms of religion, in some areas there are votive inscriptions pertaining to local gods, quite a few of which can be readily identified as Celtic deities. These inscriptions provide information about indigenous gods and goddesses who were worshiped on hilltops, near bodies of water, and in relation to other sanctified features of the landscape. Small shrines are found in a number of locations, often with solar or celestial symbols. There is evidence for the veneration of local divinities, as well as some known in other contemporary Celtic regions.

Indigenous Celtiberian deities included the goddesses Boiogena (""Mother of Cattle""), Drusuna (whose name may signify a connection with the oak tree), Ataecina (possibly associated with night time and/or the underworld), Amma (a mother goddess), and the Duillae (who appear to be a female triad associated with foliage or trees).

Male deities included Arco, Vacocius, the Lattuerii (gods possibly associated with war); Teutates (an epithet seen in other Celtic regions, denoting ""the god of the tribe""); and the Duiris Ordaecis, whose name may contain the word for ""hammer"" (depictions of a hammer deity occur elsewhere in the ancient Celtic world, a symbol that may have to do with thunder, or powers of life and death).

Deities known to have been venerated in other Celtic cultural contexts included the widely-worshiped god Lugus (known in Gaul and other locations, whose name appears to be cognate with that of the multi-skilled Irish god Lug); Epona (a widely worshiped goddess in the ancient Celtic world, associated with horses, fertility, and journeys to the afterlife or Otherworld); Bormanus (also venerated at thermal springs and sanctuaries in Gaul); and Nemedus (whose name contains the root word ""nemed / nemet"" meaning ""sacred place"", variants of which occur in other Celtic regions).

One of the most unique features of Celtiberian artwork pertaining to the physical expression of religious ideology are large granite sculptures in the shape of boars and bulls, known as ""verracos"". These appear to have played an important role in the religion of the pre-Roman population. Representations of human heads, a symbol found widely throughout the Celtic-speaking Iron Age world is one of many important symbols connecting these cultures with others on the Continent and in Ireland and Britain. These also include representations of birds, animals, and fish; plant motifs; solar and lunar motifs; and triplism pertaining to deities or religious symbols.

Life-size stone figures armed with round shields and daggers are found near some fortified settlements. Referred to as ""guerreros galaicos"", they are often depicted wearing neck rings known as torques. These ornaments have been found in the archaeological record, consisting of heavy gold penannular rings with various types of decoration on their terminals, including horsemen; solar barques; animals, birds and other important religious symbols and ideological elements.",-600,300,2096,739,Sharon Paice MacLeod,2023-10-11 21:36:07.966 +0200,2023-12-19 23:53:49.947 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
1990,The Ayuwang Monastery 阿育王寺,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Ayuwang monastery is located in the western foothill of Mount Mao 鄮 in present-day Ningbo 寧波. The origin story of this monastery recounts the legend of Liu Sahe 劉薩訶 (alt. 劉薩何), also known by his dharma name Huida 慧達. Legend has it that he encountered a deity in the netherworld and subsequently revived to worship the Aśoka stūpas as an act of repentance. According to the Ji Shenzhou sanbao gantong lu 集神州三寶感通錄 (comp. 664), upon arriving in Mao county in 281 CE, Liu Sahe heard the sound of a bell at midnight and witnessed the emergence of a śarīra stūpa from underground. Historical records from the Datang Yuezhou dudufu Maoxian Ayuwang si changzhutian bei 大唐越州都督府鄮縣阿育王寺常住田碑 (833) and the Sheli baota zhuan 舍利寶塔傳 (972) document the establishment of this monastery in 405 CE to protect the śarīra stūpa. During Emperor Wu 武 of Liang’s 梁 reign (502-549), the monastery underwent expansion, acquiring more buildings and arable lands through imperial patronage. An official plaque inscribed with “Ayuwang si 阿育王寺” was granted, naming this monastery after King Aśoka of the Maurya Empire due to the śarīra stūpa’s association with Aśoka’s distribution of the Buddha’s relics in Buddhist tradition. Although the Ayuwang monastery declined during wartime chaos, it was later restored, regaining significance as an influential site in the seventh century. As the cult of the śarīra stūpa became popularized during the Tang dynasty (618-907), this monastery received substantial support from patrons of diverse social standings and developed local power in the southeast region. In the tenth century, the śarīra stūpa preserved in the Ayuwang monastery was relocated to Hangzhou by the order of Wuyue ruler Qian Chu 錢俶 (r. 947-978) and subsequently transported to the Northern Song capital in Kaifeng. In 1008, the Song court granted the Ayuwang monastery an imperial plaque, renaming it “Guangli 廣利,” and restructuring it into a “ten directions Chan monastery” (shifang chancha 十方禪剎). Prior to this change, the Ayuwang monastery was recognized for its emphasis on Vinaya teachings, with monk Huize 慧則 (835-908) serving as the abbot. The connection with Baoyun Yitong 寶雲義通 (927-988) indicated the dissemination of Tiantai 天台 teachings within this monastery. Since its transformation into a Chan monastery, prominent Chan masters, such as Dajue Huailian 大覺懷璉 (1010-1090), Zhenxie Qingliao 真歇清了 (1088-1151), and Dahui Zonggao 大慧宗杲 (1089-1163), made significant efforts to elevate the prestige of this monastery. Visits by Japanese Buddhist monks, such as Chōgen 重源 (1121-1206) and Myōan Eisai 明庵榮西 (1141-1215), extended the Ayuwang monastery’s fame overseas. In the thirteenth century, the Ayuwang monastery obtained imperial recognition as one of the “Five Mountains.” Meanwhile, the cult of the śarīra stūpa in Ayuwang monastery further expanded as a result of its divine manifestations exhibited in the imperial courts of Southern Song and Yuan. In 1382, this monastery received the official title “Ayuwang chansi 阿育王禪寺” from the Ming court and reinstated its religious rank as the fifth among the Five Mountains of Chan school. Despite experiencing multiple destruction and subsequent rebuilding, the Ayuwang monastery continues to endure as a renowned Buddhist site to this day.",400,2023,2097,730,Yi Liu,2023-10-21 15:28:33.734 +0200,2023-11-24 17:31:49.310 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Other sections presented an analysis of the system of worship starting from the prayer (Salat), Fasting, charity (Zakat and Sadaqh), Pilgrimage (Hajj and Umrah), which constitute the second aspect of the pillars of Islam. Another area presented by the text is the principles of social interaction (Mu'amalat), which centered on marital affairs, inheritance, commercial transactions, legal justice, and others. The text extends discussions on the Islamic history to present the biography of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and the history of the subsequent caliphate of the Omayyad and Abbasid dynasties. Likewise!

In the Homeric 'Catalogue of Ships' the region was divided into two regions, one called Boeotia and the other referred to as Minyan. The people of the region fit into the definition of Greek identity. The main deity of the Boeotians was Athena Itonia, who was worshipped at Coronea, as well as Zeus; the two became the chief deities of the region in the Hellenistic period. There were also a series of related cults to Apollo across the region, located at Mount Ptoion (this is also where epigraphic evidence shows the first mentions of the group's name), the Ismenion in Thebes, Telphousa west of Haliartos, Mount Thourion near Chaeronea, Tegyra near Orchomenos, and the sanctuary of Trophonius, who is some times a son of Apollo in ancient genealogies (Schachter [1967]).

1994,Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFES),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFES) is an interdenominational Christian movement established in 1968 to cater for the spiritual needs of Christian students in Nigeria's tertiary educational institutions. The body is affiliated to the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES) and is acclaimed to have affected several hundred lives across the nation. NIFES has established its unit fellowships on several campuses including Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education spread across the six geo-political zones of the country. The group builds disciples, trains and explores the potentials in the young folks who choose to identify with them. NIFES prides itself as an organisation that is in the habit of building tomorrow’s leaders today.

NIFES focuses on evangelism and discipleship. They do this by encouraging members to take part in programmes geared towards soul-winning and disciple-building. At the apex of the group’s organogram is a Board of Trustees which includes eminent personalities in the nation’s Christian circle. The group is led by a National Director who coordinates the day-to-day activities of the organization. 

NIFES is structured into sub-zones and zones for easy administration. Each zone is coordinated by the Training Secretary who constantly visits campuses in their area ensuring they keep up with the ministry’s cardinal programmes at all times. Each NIFES campus unit is governed by a student executive council elected by the local congregation under the supervision of the Training Secretary. Due to the nature of the group, it is necessary to have change of student executive yearly. This is because while some graduate, others would need to change executive positions and serve in other roles before they also exit the campus at their own time. 

The campus/unit Executive report to the Training Secretary who in turn makes report of the campus fellowships in their area to the regional/national leadership. They hold national programmes at the NIFES National Campgrounds in Kwali, in the outskirts of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. 
To meet her financial obligations, the fellowship relies on funding received from offertory collections taken during fellowship meetings as well as from friends, patrons and other free-will offerings from other categories of people. 
Since the fellowship was one of the first campus Christian groups to appear in Nigeria, it has served generations of students for close to six decades. Many old-time members of the group recommend them to their children, wards, relations and friends who are newly admitted to Nigerian tertiary educational institutions. As a result, the fellowship thrives on a reputation and standard it has built over the years.",1968,2023,1082,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-10-25 12:31:21.987 +0200,2023-11-15 00:55:38.112 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The church was immensely popular with Norwegians arriving in the port in Cardiff, at the time the world's largest coal exporting port. Norwegians came with timber for the pit props in the coal mines and brought coal to the world. Activity declined following World War II, and the Norwegian Seamen's Mission left the church in Cardiff in 1959.

1997,Hundred and eighty precepts of Lord Lao,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The “Hundred and eighty precepts of Lord Lao” (Laojun bai bashi jie 老君百八十戒) is one of the earliest lists of Taoist precepts dating from the 4th - 6th century. The precepts deal with various themes relating to community life, in which social relationships, living beings, material things and the natural environment are all part of the same coherent whole to be respected. A third of the subjects mentioned, such as theft, murder or debauchery, are similar to the rules of Hinayanist Buddhist disciplines (Prātimokṣa). These Taoist precepts are moral exercises aimed at individual or collective salvation as well as self-transcendence. Their intoned recitation (songjie 誦戒) is incantatory psalmody and enables adepts to protect themselves from misfortune, wild beasts, and demons. Two versions of the ""Hundred and eighty precepts of Lord Lao"" appear in the 6th-century Taishang Laojun jinglü 太上老君經律 (DZ 786, 2a-20b) and the 8th-century Yaoxiu keyi jielü chao 要修科儀戒律鈔 (DZ 463, 14a-19a).

Part of the text and preface date from the 4th century, and the second part from the 6th century. According to the preface in the Taishang Laojun jinglü and its two variants, this list of precepts would be an appendix to the Taiping jing 太平經 revealed by deified Laozi (Lord Lao, Laojun) during the Eastern Zhou dynasty (8th - 3rd c. BCE) to a recipient named Gan Ji 干吉(or Yu Ji 于吉).

1998,The Chinese Christian Scroll Pelliot chinois 3847,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The small, six-sheet Christian scroll, known by its modern pressmark Pelliot chinois 3847, was discovered in the famous Library Cave near Dunhuang. Since its in situ acquisition by Paul Pelliot (1878-1945) in 1908, the provenance of this scroll has been well documented. The first published description of the scroll was made in 1909 by Luo Zhenyu 羅振玉 (1866-1940) in his Dunhuang shishi yishu 敦煌石室遺書 (Lost Books from the Dunhuang Stone Chamber). The next year, Luo published five facsimiles of the texts of the scroll in Shishi bibao 石室秘寶 (Secret Treasures from the Stone Chamber). Housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, both the texts and materiality of the scroll provide important witnesses to Christianity in Tang China (618-907) and likely through to the time of the Library Cave’s sealing in the early eleventh century. Of such witnesses, A.C. Moule recognized the scroll’s content as being second in importance only to that of the Xi’an Stele of 781. Recent scholarship has favored dating the production of this scroll to after the Tang and before the cave’s sealing, though the composition of at least some of its texts likely date to during the Tang. The scroll contains three distinct texts. The first is titled Daqin Jingjiao sanwei mengdu zan 大秦景教三威蒙度讚 (Hymn in Praise of the Salvation Achieved through the Three Majesties of the Luminous Teaching), and is a Chinese translation, in metrical form, of the Gloria in excelsis Deo. The hymn remains the only text of the so-called Jingjiao corpus to be a complete translation of a known Christian work. The second text is simply titled Zunjing 尊經 (the Scripture of the Honored) — note that ‘scripture’ (jing) here possesses a wider semantic range than just canonized Christian Scriptures. This work begins with an invocation to the Trinity and is followed by a list of honored persons and texts. Some of the Chinese names are transcriptions of foreign words — likely Syriac, in most cases. The third text is a postscript supplying an historical narrative on the translation of Christian works into Chinese. This narrative supplies information that both parallels and complements the Xi’an Stele.  The note likely points to the titles listed in the Zunjing as those of Christian works then existing in Chinese. The note also provides rare information on the original materiality of Christian books before the translation of some of their texts onto scrolls. Regarding material aspects of the scroll itself, red reader’s marks in the hymn text suggest this copy was once used for liturgy. The scroll also evidences being assembled piecemeal, with texts written onto sheets before later being joined to form a single scroll. At the end of the scroll, a red seal with seal characters for Daqin si 大秦寺, denoting a Christian monastery or church, again suggests this text was used by Christians before entering the predominantly Buddhist context of the Mogao Caves 莫高窟.",635,1000,2103,1524,Daniel Sheridan,2023-10-25 21:32:13.127 +0200,2024-01-26 16:13:19.722 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

In 1651, the mosque appears in the records of the qadi (judge) of Rethymno. The mosque complex includes the nine-domed mosque, measuring 16.6 by 16.2 meters, as well as eight vaulted cells, and a nearby tekke (communal dervish compound) used by the Bektashi Sufi order. Following the population transfer between Greece and Turkey of 1924 which expelled the island's Muslim population, the mosque was no longer used for prayer, and was damaged during the bombings of 1941. Between 2000-2006, the mosque was restored and is now the Rethymno Palaeontological Museum. While the mosque is within the boundaries of modern-day Rethymno, in the mid-seventeenth century at the time of its founding, the site was located outside of the city proper.",1646,1924,2102,1520,Sofia Kane,2023-10-26 14:27:07.374 +0200,2023-11-01 17:05:05.330 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2000,"The Community Church of Apostles Nigeria and Oversea (COCANO), Ajegunle",43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1933, the Community Church of Apostles Nigeria and Oversea (COCANO) separated from the rapidly growing Aladura movement, a stock of the Cherubim and Seraphim Society introduced to Ilajeland in 1929. The members of the C & S movement in Ilajeland during this period were highly mobile holding their conventions across the towns and villages in Ilajeland. In 1933, they had attended a convention in Ereke. While most members returned to their communities, a group stayed back at the convention venue, making it their home with the intention of continuing there permanently.

The group continued there until a time when the establishment of theocratic communities in Ilajeland gained currency. At this time, they decided to move to the natal town of the group’s premier leader where enough provision had been made to accommodate them. Their relocation to Ajegunle follows the pattern of Wilson Eran Ikudehinbu who left Ayetoro for former Maran Apostles now Ori-Oke Iwamimo and Lot Korollo who also led his group from his former church location to merge his Christian group with his natal community of Oropo about two miles west of Mahin. 

At Ajegunle, the COCANO has continued to advance their beliefs as its spiritual fervour has had significant impact on the local community. The church holds its conventions, anniversaries and other special programmes in the community boosting local trade and businesses. It advances the global picture of Ajegunle and has continued to place the town on the public stage as the host community of the Christian group. The church has had its fair share of the succession debacle which has plagued most of the theocratic communities in Ilajeland but has found a way to overcome the challenges posed by this widespread problem.  

As with most of the other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, COCANO is organised along several bands for easy coordination and administration. The church appoints leaders for each band. The band leadership is responsible to the Oba (monarch) and the church council for the activities of the group and welfare of her members. Roles are assigned to various bands by the monarch towards the furtherance of the church programmes and agenda. Though there are subtle difference between the COCANO and some other theocratic communities in the area, the group still relates freely with these sister religious settlements within the region. They both offer and receive special invitations to participate in programmes and events marking important milestones in the life and history of one another.",1933,2023,2104,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-10-26 17:42:49.697 +0200,2023-11-12 08:07:39.804 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2001,The Book of Deuteronomy,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Deuteronomy the fifth book of the Hebrew Bible, positioned as the final book of the Pentateuch (Genesis – Deuteronomy), and the first book of the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua – Kings). The book holds a unique position between these two “collections” and many scholars argue it serves as a bridge between the pre-history of Israel in the Pentateuch and the history of Israel’s monarchy as described in Joshua-Kings. In the Jewish tradition, the book is titled “devārîm” or “words,” named after the first few words of the book. In the Christian tradition, the title “Deuteronomy” comes from the Greek Septuagint and means “second law” or “repetition,” as Deuteronomy consistues a second iteration of the law previously given in the Covenant Code (Exodus 20-23). The book of Deuteronomy is structured as several speeches given by Moses to the Israelite community as they leave Egypt and prepare to enter the promised land. The core of the book is chapters 12-26 which contain the core content of the “second law.” Michael Coogan suggests that this core is surrounded by a dual introduction (ch. 1-4 and 5-11), two additional speeches (ch. 27-30), a conclusion (ch. 34), and some supplementary poetry (ch. 32:1-44), narrative (ch. 31; 32:45-52), and blessings (ch. 33). Given the book’s composite nature, scholars agree it was likely composed through several stages of editorial activity over a long period of time. While the dates of these layers are largely unknown, editorial activity likely spanned from as early as the 8th century BCE through the early Persian Period. Several scholars have noted similarities between the book of Deuteronomy and Mesopotamian, Hittite, and Aramaic treaty traditions and law codes. Considering these comparisons, Deuteronomy has come to be understood as a covenant, or treaty agreement between God and Israel, which sets out the terms and conditions of their relationship. The terms and conditions of this agreement include an emphasis on cult centralization, ritual purity laws, proper conduct of religious rituals, criminal laws, and social organization. Overall, the book of Deuteronomy establishes a contract between Israel and God whereby God’s presence will be guaranteed so long as Israel obeys the various terms and conditions of the contract.",-700,-500,1404,1380,Morganne Ottobre,2023-10-26 18:12:07.985 +0200,2023-10-26 18:12:07.985 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2002,Mawangdui Laozi 馬王堆老子,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Mawangdui Laozi 馬王堆老子 is the name attributed to two silk manuscripts excavated from Mawangdui tomb n. 3 during an archaeological expedition in the small village of Mawangdui, in the outskirts of the city of Changsha 長沙, Hunan 湖南 province. These two silk texts represent some of the earliest versions (with the exception of the three Laozi bamboo bundles excavated from Guodian tomb n. 1) of the text later known as the Daodejing 道德經 (“Classic of the Way and Virtue”) and are also known under the name Laozi boshu 老子帛書 (Laozi silk manuscripts). The two manuscripts are now preserved at the Hunan Provincial Museum (湖南省博物館) in the city of Changsha.
The burial complex of Mawangdui includes three graves belonging to three members of the family of the Marquis of Dai 軑 and Chancellor of the Kingdom of Changsha, Li Cang 利蒼, who lived during the early years of the Han 漢 Dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE). Li Cang occupied tomb n. 2, his wife Xin Zhui 辛追, tomb n. 1, and one of their sons, whose name is unknown, tomb n. 3, where the two Laozi manuscripts have been found. Thanks to an inventory slip found inside the tomb, it is known that it has been sealed in the year 168 BCE. A large number of silk texts, philosophical, astronomical, military, and medical in content (to mention a few), were found inside a lacquered box inside the tomb, totaling about 120000 written words. Some of the manuscripts were already known to the tradition, such as the case of the two Laozi, the Yijing 易經 (Classic of changes) found within the same tomb, along with various commentaries related to it, and a copy of the Zhanguo ce 戰國策 (Annals of the Warring States), while others represent texts unknown until the time of the excavation or known only by their title.
As regards the two Laozi, these are two versions that are roughly complete with respect to the transmitted text, and they are more alike to each other than to any other edition of the Daodejing, but they still exhibit a few discrepancies. They are referred to as Laozi A (jia 甲) and Laozi B (yi 乙), and both present various lacunae due to damage to the material support, to a greater extent in the case of manuscript A. What principally distinguishes these two versions from the transmitted text is the inversion of the two macro-sections that make up the Daodejing: meaning that, in both Mawangdui texts, the De 德 (virtue) section precedes the Dao 道 (way) section, as is also the case for the Peking University bamboo slips version of the Laozi (Hanjianben Laozi 漢簡本老子), acquired by Peking University in 2009, and dated around the reign of Emperor Wu 武 (156 – 87 BCE). Manuscript B even presents the characters De and Dao as the titles in the openings of the two sections, followed by the total number of characters, thus giving the impression that the two sections were perceived as two distinct texts. The reverse order of the two macro-sections resulted in the two manuscripts found in Mawangdui also being referred to as Dedaojing 德道經.
The order of passages also varies slightly from the textus receptus. Taking the chapters of the transmitted Daodejing as a reference, the order found in the Mawangdui manuscripts is: 38-39, 41, 40, 42-66, 80-81, 67-79 (De) and 1-21, 24, 22-23, 25-37 (Dao). The sequence of the passages follows the same order in both manuscript editions. Compared to the textus receptus, some verses are incomplete, or present lexical and graphic variants – not always identical between the two editions A and B. Moreover, Mawangdui texts include a greater number of grammatical words than the transmitted Daodejing: an example is the far more frequent use of the appositional sentence final particle ye 也.
Of the two manuscripts, Laozi A is earlier and dated roughly between 221 and 206 BCE; Laozi B is dated around 206-194 BCE (during the reign of Liu Bang 劉邦, emperor Gao Zu 高祖 of the Han). In support of these dating hypotheses, Laozi A is written in the Qin 秦 dynasty (221-206 BCE) xiaozhuan 小篆 (small seal) calligraphic style, while Laozi B is written in the lishu 隸書 (clerical script) calligraphic style. Furthermore, text B avoids the use of Liu Bang’s name characters, employing guo 國 as a synonym for bang 邦. Yet, it does not avoid neither ying 盈 nor heng 恆, from Liu Ying and Liu Heng’s names. Text A does not present such avoidance, reinforcing the hypothesis that it must have been transcribed before 206 BCE. 
Although the two versions are very similar to each other, some variations in wording (beyond the already mentioned tabooed words in manuscript B) are present. To cite a few examples: the second verse of the received chapter 46 in Mawangdui A reads 天下無道戎馬生於郊, while Mawangdui B reads 道戎馬生於郊, with no repetition of tianxia 天下, already present in the preceding verse, and the passage goes on reading 非莫大於可欲 in A, and 非莫大可欲 in B, with the omission of yu 於; the closing verse of received chapter 16 appears in manuscript A as 沕身不怠, and in manuscript B as 道乃沒身不殆, with either wu 沕 or mei 沒, and dai 怠 or dai 殆.
Several orthographic inconsistencies suggest that manuscripts A and B may have been written by different scribes.
Neither manuscript includes a systematic division into chapters and neither of them numbers them. Nevertheless, manuscript A presents a more systematized use of punctuation: comma-like strokes on the bottom right side of characters, that seems to signal a pause, and bigger dots in the center of a line at the beginning of longer textual sections that sometimes correspond to the division into chapters of the textus receptus. Laozi B only uses the comma-like stroke and does it sporadically. 
In some instances, chapters that are separate in the received Daodejing seem to be conceived as a continuous piece in the Mawangdui manuscripts. For example, the passage corresponding to chapter 68 from the received text starts with gu 故 (therefore) in Laozi B – indicating the connection with the preceding passage.
Both the absence of a precise chapter division, particularly in Manuscript B, and the reverse order of the De and Dao sections have led scholars to question what the original structure of the text must have been. The division of the textus receptus into chapters could represent a later alteration by the commentators, but at the same time, the presence of punctuation marks that seem to signal in some way the partition between some sections in Laozi A would lead one to think that by the time that the manuscript was transcribed, some subdivisions must have already taken form. As regards the inverted order of the De and Dao sections, it could on the one hand represent a marginal issue, related to a misunderstanding in the sequence of transcription of the texts, but it could also indicate the existence, by the second century BCE, of two distinct textual traditions: one characterized by the Dao-de sequence and one by the De-Dao sequence. Even the very coexistence of two such similar manuscripts within the same burial prompts questions about their origins: it is still unclear whether these are two separate elaborations of the same original text. 
The two Laozi are inked on two separate silk scrolls along with other works. As for manuscript A, it is followed by four Confucian texts, while manuscript B follows a group of Huanglao 黃老 texts, known by the title Huangdi sijing 黃帝四經 (Four Classics of the Yellow Emperor).
Laozi A is written on a silk cloth of about 350 cm (with the Laozi itself occupying around 170 cm in length), while Laozi B silk cloth is around 165 cm long.",-221,-194,598,1195,Francesca Puglia,2023-10-26 22:35:12.640 +0200,2023-10-27 14:28:52.074 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2003,Nigerian Baptist Convention,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry about the Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC), a Christian denomination (evangelical protestant) which began with membership in South-Western part of Nigeria and has since spread to the North Central, North Western, North Eastern, South-Southern and South-Eastern Part of the country. The group is divided into at least 35 Baptist Conferences across all the 6 geopolitical zones in the country with several sub-divisions referred to as Baptist Associations. These Baptist Conferences and Associations are spread across all the states in the country. The Nigerian Baptist Convention began in 1914 with the appellation “Yoruba Baptist Association” which later metamorphosed into the Nigerian Baptist Convention. Although the Convention has its largest membership in South-Western Nigerian states (Such as Oyo, Osun, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo and Ekiti States); large membership are still recorded in the South-Southern and Northern regions (such as Delta, Edo, Rivers, Kaduna, Plateau, Niger and Kogi States). There are over 13,000 local congregations that makes up the Nigerian Baptist Convention.  The Nigerian Baptist Convention has extended her mission efforts beyond the shore of Nigeria to countries like Cote D’Ivoire, Benin Republic and the United Kingdom. The Nigerian Baptist Convention is committed to theological education with at least 10 theological institutions for the training of gospel ministers. Her commitment to secular education is also evidence in the presence of hundreds of Baptist primary and secondary schools all over the country (owned by the Convention, the Conferences, Associations and local churches). The Schools of Nursing and the Bowen University owned by the denomination provides tertiary education in different academic fields. There are at least 10 medical facilities owned by the Nigerian Baptist Convention spread across the country that provides medical services for people. The Nigerian Baptist Convention believes in the following distinctive: the Bible as sole authority for faith and practice, autonomy of the local church, priesthood of all believers, baptism and the Lord’s supper as the two ordinances of the church, individual soul competency, separation of church and state, the office of pastor and deacon as the two recognized offices of the denomination. The Denomination is a member of a larger Christian body in Nigeria referred to as Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN).  The denomination has a worshiping community of over 8 million people making it the second largest Baptist Convention Affiliating with the Baptist World Alliance. The denomination holds her delegate Convention yearly in the month of April. The office headquarters of the denomination is situated in Ibadan, Nigeria. Rev.

2004,Recep Pasha Mosque in Rhodes,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Recep Pasha Mosque in the walled city of Rhodes was built in 1588 at the behest of Recep Pasha, an Ottoman statesman who later became Grand Vizier in 1632. The square, single-domed mosque, decorated on the interior with Iznik tiles, is oriented toward the qibla, and is attached to a three-domed portico. A türbe (mausoleum) is located to the east of the mosque, and contains three tombs, dated after 1702. There is a shadirvan (octagonal fountain) located to the northwest of the mosque, in front of the entrance. 

In 1671, Evliya Çelebi described the mosque during his travels in Rhodes, commenting on the beauty of its decoration. 

The mosque had been financed by a vakf (Islamic charitable foundation) since its creation; during the Italian administration of the Dodecanese between 1912 and 1943, this foundation came under the authority of the Italian administration. Since 1947, when the Dodecanese were incorporated into Greece, the vakfs of Rhodes and neighboring Kos have been administered by committees appointed by the Greek government. 

Suggestions have been made that the mosque be converted into a museum of Islamic art and/or ceramics. Currently (as of 2020), the mosque is not open for visit or worship, and has been closed for the past 25 years.",1588,2023,2105,1520,Sofia Kane,2023-10-30 09:03:00.608 +0100,2023-11-10 13:50:51.904 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2006,New Life for All Nations Ministries,43,Religious Group (v6),"New Life for all Nations Ministries is a product of a massive evangelistic push in villages, towns and cities in southwest Nigeria in the early to mid 1970s. The evangelistic work which produced the church was spearheaded by an itinerant preacher by the name, J.K Solomon. Evangelist Solomon had previously been a Police officer in the Nigerian Police Force. He however heeded the call to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all nations. He was supported by a band of young and enthusiastic evangelists in the evangelistic campaigns. Together, they travelled across major towns in western Nigeria to preach the gospel and disciple those who accepted their message. They then planted churches in these towns, leaving behind one or a few members of their team to help groom the converts. When members of the newly established church became stable in faith, they also began to launch out to their surroundings to evangelise and further expand the membership of the church. 
The church has its headquarters in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria from where its branches are coordinated for effective implementation of the church mandate. The vision of the church includes; 
1.	To take the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation of the world
2.	To plant New Testament churches in every nation and
3.	To disciple the reached for the purpose of reaching un-reached. 

To fulfil its mandate, the church relies on members to engage in personal evangelism as it also organises and conducts mass evangelistic campaigns. It also engages the mass media, new media and other outlets to propagate the gospel. A number of other tools aside evangelism are deployed to ensure the church continues on the path of actualising its dreams. These tools include in-depth study of the scriptures, prayers and other fellowship programs. The church Mission and Pastoral Institute provides training for ministers and missionaries who are designated to lead church branches or those being sent out as missionaries to new or existing missions fields. 

As a means of fulfilling its vision the church holds annual conventions where members from the various branches come together in corporate fellowship to reinforce their collective beliefs and encourage one another unto the burden they all willingly bear. During such periods, the general congregation of the church engages in corporate mission outreach, workshops and specialised seminars which are all targeted towards renewing their resolve and engagement for evangelism (soul-winning). Constitutionally, the term of office of the President or General Overseer is tenured. They have succeeded in having peaceful transition from one leader to the other. The leaders claim that position is a privilege and so should not become a subject of quarrel or strive. They appear to be committed to fulfilling the evangelism mandate they set for themselves above the quest for occupying offices. As a result of their evangelistic drive, the church now has branches in many anglophone and francophone countries in West Africa, Europe and the Americas.",1972,2023,2118,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-10-30 14:16:32.188 +0100,2023-11-11 16:50:31.559 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2007,Iron Age Cultic Place at Lachish,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Excavations at Tell ed-Duweir (ancient Lachish) in 1966 and 1968 directed by Y. Aharoni uncovered what the excavator understood as an Iron Age cultic place in the northeastern part of the site, comprised of what he referred to as a ‘Sanctuary’ and a nearby ‘High Place’. These were located very close to a much later cultic pace, the so-called ‘Solar Shrine’, a temple belonging to the later Persian-Hellenistic period occupation of Lachish. The excavator associated the construction of these Iron Age features with stratum V of the site, and argued that the Sanctuary had been destroyed and gone out of use also in stratum V, dating to the latter part of the tenth century BCE (the earlier part of the local Iron Age IIA), while the High Place had continued until Level III (the local Iron Age IIB), which was destroyed in 701 BCE during an Assyrian campaign against the kingdom of Judah (to which Lachish belonged). 

The Sanctuary is a simple, rectangular one-room structure of about 3.3m x 2.3m, with a plastered floor, stone-built benches, a stone-built raised podium in one corner. The contents of the room include: a small limestone altar with four roughly formed ‘horns’ at the corners; three cylindrical ceramic stands, as well as two special bowls with protruding peg-shaped bases that fit the bowl into the upper opening of two of those stands; several ceramic chalices and lamps; and several completely or partially preserved regular domestic vessels, including bowls, kraters, cooking pots, and jugs. A small stone interpreted by the excavator as a cultic standing stone is more likely for grinding. The publication of the Sanctuary leaves several questions about its stratigraphy open, and it may have more than one phase of construction. Based on more recent excavations in this part of the site and current knowledge of the local Iron Age IIA ceramic sequence, its construction and use only in stratum V appears to be correct, though some vessel forms could place it slightly earlier (near the beginning of the tenth century BCE) than other remains from this stratum. The form of the building and its contents continue a tradition of cultic rooms already well known in the southern Levant during the Bronze Age.

The excavator understood the rear wall of the Sanctuary as continuing beyond that building and further to the southeast, where it connected to two terrace walls that formed a raised area, the High Place. Nearby, but not between these terrace walls, was found un upright standing stone, the remains of a burnt tree or wooden pole that the excavator interpreted as cultic as well, and a favissa pit with a few small, chiseled stones that the excavator also interpreted as standing stones that had now been disposed of. The excavator dated these features to different Iron Age strata, between V and III. The limited expose of the High Place in excavation, as well as the rather limited stratigraphic detail in the excavator’s final report, make his stratigraphic interpretation difficult rather tentative. The architectural connection to the Sanctuary is especially uncertain. The remains found point to some sort of cultic activity in this area, but not clearly as a single High Place as per the excavator.",-950,-701,2107,1467,Zachary Thomas,2023-10-31 07:27:20.486 +0100,2023-10-31 07:27:20.486 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Several deities was taught to have been born within the region, including Zeus, Hermes, and Pan. Until the fourth century they did not have a strong connection to the rest of the Hellens through genealogical connections. 

Deities like Zeus Lycaeus, Pan, and Despoina were traditional pan-Arcadian deities (Just 2007, 264).

2010,Bektashi Tarika,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Bektashi tarika, a Sufi religious order, traces its founding to Haci Bektash Beli, who arrived in Anatolia in the 13th century CE (7th century AH) from Khorasan. The religious order became influential within the Ottoman Empire, in part due to its association with the powerful Janissary corps; Bektashi tekkes, or lodges, were built across the Ottoman Empire, most notably in the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Aegean.

Although the order became powerful in the Ottoman Empire, which officially followed the Sunni Hanafi school, the practices of the order include recognition of the twelve imams, a Shi'ite practice. The group's practices also drew from popular mysticism and incorporated some Christian elements, such as the welcoming of new members with wine, bread and cheese, which is perhaps drawn from the Artotyrite version of Christian communion. The order was led by the Celebi, who lived in the pir-evi (dervish lodge) built over the tomb of Haci Bektash near Kirshehir and Kayseri in central Anatolia.

Influential Bektashi writings include the Makalat of Haci Bektash, which was written in Arabic and later translated into  Turkish. 

Due to the affiliation of the Janissary corps with the Bektashi tariqa, the destruction of the Janissary corps in 1826 by Mahmud II negatively affected the continuation of the order.

As of 1915, Bektashi communities continued to exist in Asia Minor, the Balkans (especially Albania), and the Aegean (see F. W. Hasluck). However, Bektashi tekkes were also built in Cairo, Baghdad, and Karbala. Today, the Bektashi order exists most prominently in Albania.

Both men and women took part in Bektashi rites. Bektashi tekkes, or lodges, were most commonly built on the outskirts of densely inhabited areas; this contrasted with tekkes of other Sufi orders that were more commonly built in urban centers (Hasluck, p. 85-86). An example of this phenomenon can be seen clearly in the old city of Rethymno on Crete: while the Veli Pasha Bektashi lodge was built in the agricultural land outside of the city center, two other Sufi lodges were built within the city shortly after the Ottoman conquest of Rethymno.",1240,2023,2109,1520,Sofia Kane,2023-11-01 15:27:13.935 +0100,2024-04-01 15:31:03.411 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2012,The Five Theological Orations of Gregory of Nazianzus (The Theologian),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Gregory of Nazianzus (ca. 329–390), also known as Gregory the Theologian, a 4th-century bishop of Nazianzus in Cappadocia and later archbishop of Constantinople is widely considered the most accomplished rhetorical stylist of the patristic era, with a significant impact on the formation of Trinitarian theology. When Basil of Caesarea (or Basil the Great) passed away on January 1st of 378, Gregory became the prominent spokesman of the Nicene party that accepted the decrees of the Council of Nicaea of 325. He was invited to take charge of the Nicene congregation at Constantinople, a city torn by sectarian strife. His Chapel of the Resurrection (or Anastasia, in Greek) became the scene of the birth of Byzantine Orthodoxy, that is, the post-Nicene theology and practice of most of the Eastern Christianity. Among the sermons that Gregory preached at the Church of Anastasia were his five “Theological Orations”, a striking presentation of trinitarian doctrine. The sermons were preached in the Church of Anastasia between 379 and 381 and have gained for their author the title of “The Theologian”, which he shares with St. John the Evangelist alone. Nazianzen’s cardinal opponents were the followers of Eunomius and Macedonius, and it is almost entirely against them that these five “Orations” on the Godhead of the Word and the Holy Spirit are directed. Gregory’s objective was to maintain the Nicene Faith of the Trinity, the Doctrine that while there is but One Substance or Essence in the Godhead, and by consequence God is in the most absolute sense One, yet God is not Unipersonal, but within this Undivided Unity there are three Self-determining Subjects/Persons, distinguished from one another by special characteristics or personal properties: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Gregory of Nazianzus decided to fight back the followers of Eunomius, the Anomeans, as well as those of Macedonius, who denied either the Consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, or the perfect Godhead and Personality of the Holy Spirit. His five “Theological Orations” are the fruit of this effort. They consist of “Oration” 27, “Oration” 28 (On Theology), “Oration” 29 (On the Son I), “Oration” 30 (On the Son II) and “Oration” 31 (On the Holy Spirit). “Oration” 27 is in many ways an introduction of Gregory, as much as it is the topic of debate. Gregory is setting out the proper approach to theology to suggest that this is the ideal for which he strives, while the Eunomians, the Anomean party, have not pursued this end, as evidenced by their argumentative nature and their misleading of the faithful. “Oration” 28 could almost be titled “On God the Creator” since a large portion of the speech is given to the meaning of creation in relation to its Creator. But the oration could also be titled “On God the Ineffable” since a foundational principle for any language about God is recognizing the analogical limits of that language. In many ways, the core of Gregory’s argument is that humans may not know the mysterious nature of God except through the gifts of his creation, and creation speaks loudly of its Creator. “Orations” 29 and 30 are at the heart of the theological debate with the Eunomians. The first deals primarily with various logical objections they raise to the full deity of the Son, while the second deals with scriptural exegetical debates. At the heart of the logical rebuttal is the insistence that God the Father’s relationship to God the Son is logical and not-temporal and analogical and not earthly. At the heart of the exegetical rebuttal is the key that passages that exalt Christ refer to his divinity, while those which limit him or lower him refer to his humanity. In speaking of the deity of the Holy Spirit, “Oration” 31 combines approaches that Gregory applied to the Son’s deity in “Orations” 29 and 30. He addresses both the logical objections and the exegetical debates. Herein, Gregory sets out clearly the language of consubstantiality and of three hypostases.",379,381,2110,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2023-11-06 10:29:02.636 +0100,2023-12-10 16:40:49.392 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2014,Gazi Deli Huseyn Pasha Mosque in Rethymno,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This building was first established as the Church of Our Lady in the second half of the sixteenth century, while Crete was under Venetian rule. During this period, the church belonged to the Augustinian monks and had an associated monastery. 

After the Ottoman conquest of Rethymno in AD 1646, the church was converted into the Gazi Hüseyin Paşa Mosque, named for the commander of the Ottoman army in Crete from 1646-1656. It was later nicknamed Camii Neratze, meaning ""Mosque of Bitter Oranges"" in Greek. 

The mosque is a rectangular structure oriented on the east-west axis of the original church, and features three domes added after the conversion to a mosque. A carved entryway that is likely from the Venetian period is located on the northern wall of the mosque, and a türbe (mausoleum) is located to the south of the mosque.

Hüseyin Pasha created a vakf to support the mosque that consisted of the revenue from several settlements near Rethymno, Kissamos, Agios Vasileios, and Chania.

The complex included an imaret (soup kitchen), library (converted from the chapel of Corpus Christi), and school, in addition to the mosque (converted from the church of the Augustinian monastery). The conversion of the church into a mosque entailed rebuilding the south wall, adding domes to the roof, and adding a new internal support system for the domes.

According to Evliya Celebi, an Ottoman traveller who visited Crete between 1668 and 1671, the mosque complex featured a soup kitchen (imaret) that fed both the rich and the poor.

2017,Convent of Panagia Eleousa (Lykousada Monastery),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Sited below a late 13th to early 14th-century fortress, the convent of Panagia Eleousa (Merciful Virgin), otherwise known as the Lykousada monastery, was built by a Vlach sebastokratorissa, known to us only by her monastic name Hypomone, who married into the powerful family of Epirote rulers. The convent was situated at Loxada (medieval name Lykousada), a village neighboring Phanari (where the fortress is) in Thessaly. Loxada border also the Pindos mountain range, which was inhabited by many Vlachs. Hypomone's monastery does not survive, as it was burnt to the ground during the Ottoman occupation of the region, in 1611-12. However, we can reconstruct the wealth and importance of the monastery through surviving chrysobulls (imperial issued documents) that record the convent's properties, including metochia and monyndria, as well as paroikoi (peasants). The monastery is of significant importance as it is among the few known material evidence of the transhumant, nomadic group of Vlachs.",1280,1620,2115,1487,Sofia Pitouli,2023-11-10 00:13:09.505 +0100,2023-11-29 00:13:24.083 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2018,Panagia Akatamachetos (Porta Panagia),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The monastery of Porta Panagia was constructed by John I Doukas, the ruler of Thessaly (r. 1268-1289) in 1283. John I Doukas was the illegitimate son of Michael II Komnenos Doukas, the ruler of the Despotate of Epiros (r. 1230-1266/68). He was the half-brother of Nikephoros, the successor of Michael II. Porta Panagia stands in Pyli, a village in the vicinity of Trikala. Pyli, which means gate in Greek, marks the entry to a passage in the Pindus mountain range. The other end of the passage terminates at the monastery of Kato Panagia in Arta, which was built by John's father Michael II in ca. 1250. Halfway through this pass, in the village of Vourgareli at Tzoumerka, also stands the Red Church (Panagia of Vellas), which was constructed in the late thirteenth century. Primary sources mentioning Porta Panagia are a chrysobull by Andronikos III Palaiologos in 1331, a sworn letter by Michael Gabrielopoulos in 1342, and a synodical letter dated 1382. The initial plan of the church was that of a three-aisled basilica. Of interest is that the church contains the arcosolium of its founder, John I Doukas, and a painting depicting him as a monk above it. The church is also known for its two large mosaic icons flanking the templon screen.

2019,"Shaanxi Great Mosque, Urumqi",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Shaanxi Mosque is a rare Hui Chinese mosque in the predominantly Uygur city of Urumqi. This mosque was built during Qing Dynasty rule under the reign of Emperor Qianlong (1735-1796) or Emperor Jiaqing (1796-1820). It was renovated and expanded in 1906 under Emperor Guangxu (1875-1908).

The mosque is built in the Han Chinese architectural tradition of pavilions with upswept eaves made of timber beams, columns and brick and also manifests Islamic influences from the west in its use of glazed tiles. It consists of an elevated prayer hall within a high-walled precinct, marked by the bangke tower crowning its mihrab chamber. The precinct is entered from an arched brick gateway.

The east-facing prayer hall stands ten meters tall and covers an area of 250 square meters, sizable enough to accommodate 500 worshippers at a time. It is set upon a stone platform accessed by two staircases and enveloped by a narrow portico on all sides. The portico is defined by thick round wooden columns, which are painted red and set on carved stone bases. Behind its columns stand the brick, unrelieved walls of the prayer hall, except for the eastern façade where latticed and lacquered panels form the entrance.

The prayer hall has a T-type plan, consisting of a main hall and a mihrab chamber that projects, west towards the main hall, which is covered by a green-tiled hipped roof with flaring eaves. A bangke tower, a multistory pagoda with multiple eaves traditionally used for moon watching crowns the mihrab chamber. Expressively upswept eaves, particularly those of the pyramidal bangke tower roof, reveal vibrantly polychromatic woodwork featuring sets of heavy, curved dougong brackets. The roof ridges are decorated with crenellations, dragons and other animals, much like at the Great Mosque of Xi'an, and a modest crescent finial arises from the center. Below the eaves of the bangke tower is a balcony protected by latticed balustrades.

The interior of the hall is divided into five rows with columns similar to those of the portico. Overhead, vibrantly painted beams display ornate floral, as well as pictorial, scenes. The mihrab chamber is dominated by the magnificent octagonal caisson ceiling of the bangke tower. Each of the three dougong bracketed octagonal rings are marked by eight wooden lotus shaped stalactite drops, painted in various hues of orange to accentuate the sense of depth. At the base of this elaborate roof structure are screened windows and panels with idyllic painted scenes.",1735,2023,960,1527,Jonathan Ouellet,2023-11-10 17:02:46.166 +0100,2023-12-06 21:48:20.142 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The church was built in 1293/4 by protostrator Theodore Tzimiskes and his brother Ioannis Tzimiskes, along with their wives, Maria and Anna Tzimiskaina. The founders are also depicted in a donor's portrait in thenarthex of the church.

2021,The United Missionary Church of Africa,43,Religious Group (v6),"United Missionary Church of Africa (UMCA) is a Mennonite denomination that arrived in Nigeria in 1905.  The founding missionaries, whose society is known as United Missionary Society (UMS) came from the United States of America and Canada in the first half of the twentieth century.  Their home church was known as the United Missionary Church (UMC). UMC was initially known as Mennonite Brethren in Christ (MBC). Apart from its Mennonite background, the denomination was also heavily influenced by Methodism. The first missionary in Nigeria was Rev. A.W. Banfield who arrived in Nigeria in 1905.  He was well-known for reducing the Nupe language to writing, publication of Nupe Dictionary and the translation of the Bible into Nupe language.  Other missionaries such as L.R. Sloat, W. Bontrager, G. Schroeder, J. McDowell, L.K. Fuller,  and many others also joined Banfield in planting the denomination in Nigeria. The activities of the missionaries was not limited to preaching the gospel, it also included healthcare and education.  The denomination however, is well-known through its major Seminary, the UMCA Theological College, Ilorin, which trains clergy, not only from the owner denomination, but from all Protestant churches, including those from African independent churches.  Apart from Nigeria, the UMS also established churches in countries of Central America, South America and Asia
The labours of the UMC missionaries in Nigeria resulted in the United Missionary Church of Africa becoming a distinct denomination in the country in 1955. On September 29, 1956, the denomination became a registered corporate body in Nigeria.  With the support of indigenous missionaries, the denomination spread from central Nigeria to the North west and South western Nigeria.  Today the Church is well established in ten states of the thirty six states in Nigeria, including, Lagos, Oyo, Osun, Kwara, Niger, Kogi, Kebbi, Kaduna, Plateau and Nasarawa States.  UMCA can also be found in some other African countries, such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cote D’Ivoire.  The UMS handed the running of the denomination to indigenous leaders on January 5, 1978 in a service held at the Theological College, in Ilorin.
The national leader of the denomination is titled the President, who is elected every four years.  A president can use two terms of four years each; thus a President cannot spend more than eight years in office.  The regional leaders are called Church District Superintendent (CDS).  At present (2023) the church has thirty four (34) Church District Superintendents, in ten states of Nigeria.  The District Superintendents are also elected for a term of four years, renewable for another term.  Under the District Superintendents are the Area Church Councils (ACC), and then the local Churches.  Apart from the Offices, there are standing committees and Boards, overseeing the different aspects of the denomination’s activities.

2022,Murad Reis Mosque in Rhodes,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The mosque of Murad Reis is located outside of the walls of the Old City of Rhodes, on a cape to the north of Mandraki Port. In addition to the mosque, the mosque complex includes a dervish lodge of the Bektashi order, fountains, a rose garden, and a cemetery that includes the tomb of Murad Reis. The dervish tekke consisted of two buildings, one of which had living quarters for the sheikh and his family.

In his travelogue from ca. 1671, Evliya Celebi mentions a grave in the cemetery dated to 965 AH (1557-1558 CE); and dates the inscription on the Bektashi lodge to 1018 AH (1609/1610 CE), which is also the date of Murad Reis' death. The mosque was constructed by Ebubekir Pasha ca. 1622, a century after the Ottoman conquest of Rhodes; the marble plaque above the entrance to the mosque carries the date of repairs made in 1797 CE. The mosque is built on a square plan, surmounted by an octagonal drum bearing a single dome, and is oriented toward the qibla.

The minaret of the mosque was heavily remodeled during the Italian occupation of the island from 1912 to 1947; it originally had a conical spire, which is now spherical. During the period of Italian rule, the cemetery and rose garden were condensed to a smaller area than their original extent, meaning that many of the tombstones are no longer in their original positions; additionally, no new tombstones or burials were added after 1912.

The final sheikh to reside at the tekke was Sheikh Suleiman Kaşlioğlu, who was the last Mufti of Rhodes and who died in 1974. The Muslim community of Rhodes continued celebrating weddings, Mawlid, and circumcisions at the complex until 2018, at which time the tekke was converted into a music school by the Council of Monuments. Within the complex, the mosque is no longer in use or open to the public.",1557,2018,2120,1520,Sofia Kane,2023-11-13 10:55:45.327 +0100,2023-11-15 22:38:42.346 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2024,Emirzade Mosque in Chalcis,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This mosque was built shortly after the conquest of the city of Chalkida by Mehmet II in 1470.  The mosque is built on a square plan, with an octagonal drum surmounted by a hemispherical dome. Previously, the mosque likely featured a portico with three smaller domes, but the portico is no longer standing. Double rows of windows are present on the walls of the mosque, and the octagonal drum features windows as well. In addition, the minaret is no longer standing. The minaret and portico can be seen in a watercolor by A. Couchaud from 1843.

The Halil Fountain, associated with the mosque, is carved from marble with an inscription dating to 1033 (1655 CE), as well as an inscription of repairs from 1174 (1796 CE).

From his visit to Chalcis of ca. 1667, Evliya Celebi described the Emirzade Mosque as being artistically decorated, and mentioned that there were several dervish tekkes from the silsila of the Prophet's family (""Al-i Aba,"" the Ottoman equivalent of Ahl al-Beyt, p. 237). Evliya Celebi uses this term in referring to the Bektashi tariqa (as on p. 66, same volume), the Mevlevi tariqa (p. 155, same volume), and (presumably) the Kadiri tariqa (p. 359, same volume; the Kadiri order is implied but not referred to directly); elsewhere, Evliya Celebi refers to ""all three"" Al-i Aba orders, indicating that these are these three orders are implied in the term ""Al-i Aba"" (p. 381, same volume). Therefore, it is likely that the tariqa associated with this mosque belonged to one of these three orders. It has been noted by Liakopoulos et al. that an inscription inside the mosque from 1742 AD also suggests connection to a dervish lodge.

""Emir"" refers to a ruler or viceregent; ""Zade"" is the Persian term for ""son"" that was frequently used in Ottoman writings.

Repairs were made in 1958 by the Archaeological Society, and in 1971-1972 by the Archaeological Service. Today (2023), the mosque is used as an exhibition hall.",1470,2023,2121,1520,Sofia Kane,2023-11-14 15:37:39.772 +0100,2023-11-16 12:42:47.523 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2026,Heshang Gong 河上公 commentary on the Daodejing 道德经,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Heshang Gong 河上公 commentary, deemed to have been completed before the end of the Han 汉 dynasty, is the earliest complete commentary on the Daodejing 道德经 (“Classic of the Way and Virtue”) that survived until the present day. It represents, together with Wang Bi’s 王弼 edition, the most circulated edition of the Daodejing.
The author, considered a Daoist hermit, is only known by the pseudonym Heshang Gong. His real name is unknown and very little is known about his life. 
The first mention of a Daodejing commentary bearing the name Heshang Gong appears in the catalogue of Daoist literature of the Sui shu 隨書: here an edition of the Daodejing in two parts, accompanied by a Heshang Gong’s commentary (from the time of Han Wendi 文帝) is mentioned. Some biographical information is known from the preface to the commentary written by the Daoist Ge Xuan 葛玄 in the third century CE. Of him, it is said that he lived in a hut on the banks of the Huanghe 黃河 and that he devoted himself exclusively to the study of the Daodejing. There is also an anecdote that describes him as a sage with mystical abilities: after declining Wendi's invitation to court, when the emperor came to him seeking guidance on understanding the Daodejing, Heshang Gong is said to have ascended to heaven, floating in mid-air, admonishing the emperor - and then, according to this account, he finally provided the emperor with his commentary on the text. However, such an account is unrealistic for at least two reasons: firstly, the large number of synonymic compounds reveals a later date of the commentary's compilation; secondly, if the emperor had indeed received a copy, it would certainly have been catalogued in the Han shu 漢書. 
But thanks to direct references to the commentary or to Heshang Gong's proposed reading of the Daodejing in the Huainanzi and other texts, we know that it must have been compiled by the end of the later Han 后汉 (220 CE) at the latest – although the Laozi 老子 attached to it may have been interpolated by later editors. 
As pointed out by Robinet, the commentary uses a twofold register, serving both as a guide to individual self-cultivation practice (thus preparing the reader for the book's practical use as a guide to meditation) and as a political device for the state. In this way, the commentary reveals a Huanglao 黃老 approach, offering an understanding of the dao 道 on the one hand cosmological and on the other pragmatic and political.
Methodologically, Heshang Gong uses an exegetical method distinctive of the Han period, namely the zhangju 章句, dividing the text into 81 chapters and glossing it sentence by sentence.  
The reading of the text proposed by Heshang Gong in his commentary introduces new concepts, absent or almost absent from the text, and gives particular prominence to certain ideas, such as that of unity or oneness (yi 一), which is recognized as an ordering principle. It makes extensive reference to concepts rooted in correlative cosmology, such as the principles of yin 陰 and yang 陽, theorizing a system of complete correspondence between cosmos, society and human beings, in which the sage embraces the one and emulates it through non-action, regulating his body as well as ordering the state. The philosophical analysis proposed in the commentary identifies the dao of heaven with the dao of the human being, theorizing a parallel development of the cosmic order, the socio-political order and individual longevity. From a prosodic point of view, compared to the bamboo and silk versions, the Daodejing accompanied by the Heshang Gong commentary amplifies the tendency to have four-character sentences. If some sentences of this type were already present in the manuscript editions, in the text of Heshang Gong, the 4-character sentences became a proper pattern. Both the received versions of Heshang Gong and Wang Bi manifest this tendency towards four-character sentences, basically achieved through the elimination of particles. Of the approximately 400 characters that have been eliminated in these editions, compared to the silk manuscripts, most are represented by particles such as zhi 之 or ye 也. For example, the following sentence from chapter 2: ""有亡之相生也"" in the Mawangdui editions became ""故有無相生"" in the Heshang Gong edition. In this sentence, another linguistic difference can be highlighted when compared to the earlier manuscript versions, namely the almost exclusive use of the negation wu 無 where the manuscripts have wang 亡.
Furthermore, the Heshang Gong commentary provides titles for the individual chapters of the Daodejing, which almost serve as instructions for the reader, although these headings may have been added later by religious Daoists. For instance, the first chapter is titled Ti dao 體道 (""embodying the way”), the second, Yang shen 養身 (“nourishing the body/person”), the third, An min 安民 (“pacifying the people), and so on.",200,2023,1272,1195,Francesca Puglia,2023-11-16 01:00:10.917 +0100,2023-11-23 13:12:53.875 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2027,Hizb-ut-Tahrir,43,Religious Group (v6),"Strongly linked to the political thought of the Palestinian intellectual Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, Hizb-ut-Tahrir originated in the early 1950s between Palestine and Jordan. In the turbulent post-Second World War Middle East, al-Nabhani identified the structural causes of the Arab world's crisis -manifestly evident in the Nakba and the foundation of the Israeli state- in secular Arab politics and invoked the foundation of a group or party actively pursuing the restoration of the Islamic Caliphate. Hizb-ut-Tahrir is now present in the Middle East and North Africa. Since the mid-1970s, it has also been rooted in Southeast East and Central Asia, as well as in Britain, Germany, and Austria. Despite such internationalization, the movement has never gained substantial political weight anywhere due to its uncompromising rhetoric and refusal of democratic means. It is currently banned in most Arab and non-Arab countries, for it is hard to determine the actual size of the movement globally or in the national branches. Al-Nabhani remained the uncontested leader of the group until he died in 1977, followed by Abdul Qadeem Zallum until 2003 and Ata Abu Rashta since then.
Typifying Hizb-ut-Tahrir in a clear-cut analytical category is problematic since, despite its self-representation as a proper party, al-Nabhani indifferently used the Arabic term 'kutla' -group- and 'hizb' -party- in interpreting the Quran's relevant sections. Still, in the movement's conceptual backbone, the notion of ""hizb"" did not have a pejorative meaning as in antecedent Islamic reformists' understanding who, instead, rebuffed political parties as being a byproduct of Western Modernity. 
Historically, Hizb-ut-Tahrir is a clear byproduct of the XX century's Middle Eastern sociopolitical evolutions. It profoundly resented from both the interwar period and the immediate post-colonial decades. From the latter, distinctly came a vocal anti-colonialism directed against local Arab regimes culpable of having adopted Western forms of government. From the first, al-Nabhani drew inspiration for setting up pyramidal structures and rigid modes of action that closely featured the Syrian and Iraqi Ba'ath parties. In any society in which it is present, Hizb-ut-Tahrir's actions follow a well-detailed five-step strategy designed by al-Nabhani himself. In the panorama of local and coeval Islamist political activism, Hizb-ut-Tahrir represented a sort of 'third way' between classic Islamic modernist groups, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, and radical Islamism, palpably gaining momentum after Sayyd Qutb. Contrary to Hassan al-Banna's organization, al-Nabhani preferred very rigid political activism to grassroots organizations, always rejected democratic participation and refused a ""gradualist"" approach in favour of a revolutionary rupture as for Qutb. However, opposed to Qutbism, Hizb-ut-Tahrir never endorsed the notion of ""jahiliyya"" and rejected violent jihadi practices. Al-Nabhani's thought largely remained non-violent, advocating for an intellectual revival of ordinary people instead. Much of Hizb-ut-Tahrir's activities consist of study-circles for the indoctrination of novices and the creation of an intellectual vanguard to make proselytism in society. The restoration of the Caliphate would be consequential to these steps in the movement's vision. 
Besides clandestinity and state repression, Hizb-ut-Tahrir failed to gain political weight for internal reasons. First, the very rigid structure reduced adaptation capacity in ever-moving sociopolitical scenarios. Second, the proposal of an ideological reformation limited the ability to compete with other political groups endorsing more practical solutions to people's everyday needs, such as Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Jama'at al-Islamyya in Southeast Asia. Third, the will to recruit only heavily educated candidates who previously passed through an intense period of indoctrination further restrained the members' size.",1953,2023,2124,1516,Michele Benazzo,2023-11-18 13:45:15.684 +0100,2023-11-21 13:14:59.908 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It possessed the famous icon of the Virgin of Saydnaya, also known as the Shaghoura (meaning “the renowned” or “the illustrious” in Syriac), attributed to the hand of Saint Luke the Evangelist. 
It is believed that the convent was founded by the Byzantine emperor Justinian in 547, following two visions he has had of the Mother of God. The first indicated her request to have a church built for her as well as the intended site, while the second provided details for the convent’s architectural design. The church was dedicated on September 8, the day of the Virgin’s Nativity, which is still the day on which the Monastery of Saydnaya celebrates. However, there is no factual evidence supporting that Justinian founded it. Moreover, its walls bear no traces of a 6th-century construction, whereas Procopius of Caesarea († 561), the official historian of Justinian, does not mention the foundation of the convent. Instead, historical records mention that the convent was founded by a widow of Damascus during the Byzantine period, who withdrew in the desert to lead an ascetic life in Qalamoun. In either case, the origin of the convent is quite uncertain. Information about the Monastery’s history is sparse. It is assumed that unlike many churches destroyed in Syria and Egypt in 1014 by the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr-Allah, Saydnaya was most probably spared. The Monastery is first mentioned in a report addressed in 1175 to the emperor Frederick I Barbarossa by the Burchard of Strasbourg. The document describes Saydnaya and recounts its history. At the beginning of the 13th century it began to draw Western pilgrims in large numbers. Saydnaya was also spared by the Mamluk rulers (1250-1517), who destroyed many other churches and monasteries in the region. Saydnaya received financial support by the Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible (1560), while the Tsars continued to support it by authorising alms by Russian pilgrims. 
During its long history, the convent has undergone constant alterations, but the current structure belongs to the end of the Ottoman period and the early 20th century. Three sections of the complex, however, are older since they belong to the Medieval period: i. The Church of the Virgin, a small vaulted chapel at the south side of the apse of the 19th-century church that houses the miraculous icon of the Mother of God; ii. the lower floor, that includes the kitchen and the cellars, all of them barrel-vaulted at differing levels and connected by steps; and, iii. the long barrel-vaulted room below the cells of the nuns, built of alternating stones and brick, currently the visitors’ reception room. All three parts were built directly upon the bed-rock, which is visible in the passage leading to the Shaghoura. More recent renovation works have revealed that the present building was not constructed exactly on the foundations of the old one. Its central axis has been moved a few metres to the north. If there are any foundations left, the north side must be hidden underneath the church floor, while the south side might be buried below the garden between the 19th-century church and the south wall of the fortification.",547,2023,2132,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-11-19 19:52:27.107 +0100,2023-11-22 04:27:12.058 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2033,Valide Sultan Mosque in Rethymno,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Valide Sultan Mosque in Rethymno was established after the Ottoman Conquest of Rethymno in 1646. The mosque is likely a converted Venetian church, as can be seen from its rectangular structure, which is typical of Venetian churches on Crete. The two domes and single minaret of the structure were added after its conversion into a mosque. As of 2023, it is not possible to visit the mosque, although the minaret can be seen over the skyline of Rethymno. The title 'Valide Sultan' refers to the mother of the Sultan (Kösem Sultan, the mother of Sultan Ibrahim).

At the time of its construction, the Valide Sultan Mosque featured prominently just inside the main gate to the Old Town of Rethymno. According to Evliya Celebi, an Ottoman traveller who visited Crete ca. 1668, the Valide Sultan Mosque was associated with the Valide Mosque Imaret (soup kitchen) as well as a dervish lodge (Book 8, vol. 1, pp. 379-381.)",1650,1923,2134,1520,Sofia Kane,2023-11-21 15:28:46.651 +0100,2024-02-05 15:16:07.799 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2034,"The ""Mithras-Liturgy""",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The ancient Greek ritual manual known as ""PGM IV"" includes one of the most famous texts of the Greek magical papyri in lines 475-829: The mysteries of Helios-Mithras, revealed through one of his archangels to the author himself. While the ancient text does not have a title, modern scholars coined the term ""Mithras Liturgy"" which does not reflect the terminology used in the original text. The ancient terms to describe the content are ""Mysteries"" and ""Revelation"" by Helios-Mithras. The revelation comprises a detailed description of a divination ritual, with the divination being given by the creator of the mysteries himself. For being able to meet with the god and to obtain the divination it is necessary to gain a temporary status of immortality. ""Immortality"" here is understood as a characteristic feature of higher powers which is needed for being able to enter and travel through their sphere, here heaven. Because this is the place where the divination takes place: In the realm where Helios-Mithras resides. The underlying thought is that a mortal human body cannot enter the realm of the divine, but that the human soul is capable of separating temporarily from the body, and once being separated from mortal matter, the soul can obtain a temporary status of immortality which allows it to cross the borders of the physical world and to join and experience a divine sphere.

2036,Sultan Ibrahim Mosque in Rethymno,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"This mosque was constructed inside the Rethymno Fortezza (hilltop fortress) after the Ottoman conquest of Rethymno in 1646. It sits over the previous site of the Venetian cathedral of San Nicolo.

As of 1650, the vakf which supported the mosque included five villages in the prefectures of Malevyziou and Agios Vasileios Amariou, buildings in Rethymno, and the guards' dwellings in the fortress. 

In 1649, Mevlana Yusuf was assigned as the imam, and received a two-story residence near the mosque that was part of the vakf properties.

The dome (14.50 m X 6.80 m) is made from limestone and sandstone, with interior square mosaic tesserae in brown and white.

The mihrab, which retains original paint in green, yellow, red, and blue, has a plaque with part of an ayah (verse) from the Quran, referring to Zachariah visiting Mary in the Sanctuary ('kulllama dakhala 'alayha Zakariyya l-mih'raba', Quran 3:37). The rest of the ayah, not recorded in the inscription, narrates that Zakariyya found Mary with provision in the sanctuary, and asked her how it came to her; she replied that it came from God.

2037,"Saint Achillios Basilica, Larissa",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The basilica dedicated to Saint Achilliοs in the city of Larissa, Greece, is situated on the so-called hill of the fortress, between the ancient theatre and the Ottoman marketplace. The church, preserved today in a ruinous state, was discovered in July 1978, in the course of the works for the enhancement of the city’s centre. In the following years, the excavation that has taken place permitted to identify the edifice as the basilica dedicated to Saint Achilliοs († 330), which also sheltered his tomb. 
According to Saint Achillios’s Vita written in the middle of the 9th century, he was born in Cappadocia. He has held the metropolitan seat of Larissa for 35 years, while he was one of the bishops who have participated in the First Council of Nicaea of 325. The Saint has sensed his death requested the preparation of the sarcophagus in which he was going to be buried. The Vita mentions that his relics were forgotten and lost and that they were rediscovered through divine revelation 300 years later. His cult developed from the 9th century onwards, while it gained widespread popularity in the 10th century. The connection of the excavated basilica with Saint Achillios was based on the discovery of a well’s cover with the inscription “ΑΧΙΛΛΙΟΥ ΑΡΧΙΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΥ + ΚΑΙ ΤΟΥΤΟ ΤΟ ΕΡΓΟΝ”, as well as the stamp ΑΧΙΛΛΙΟΥ on the bricks, used for the construction of the monument.
The three-aisled, timber-roofed basilica measures 29.10 m by 17.80 m and is composed of an apse, a narthex and an exonarthex, which has replaced the pre-existent gallery. The significant dispersion of fragments of the monument, mainly during the Ottoman period, has led to the loss of evidence regarding its superstructure. The mosaic floor has also suffered important damages, as only some fragments in the narthex depicting birds and plants, bordered by geometric decoration, have survived. The basilica was adorned with sculptural decoration, fragments of which were discovered during the excavations. 
The erection of the building can be estimated to the middle of the 6th century, while it was most probably renovated in the 9th century, following the revival of Saint Achillios’s cult. The basilica has undergone significant modifications throughout its history: the initial floor level was raised; a semi‑circular apse was attached to the north aisle, associated with the vaulted tomb decorated with foliate crosses, identified as Saint Achillios’s tomb; two more simply decorated tombs (in the central aisle and in the outer part of the narthex) were constructed in the monument; and, lateral buttresses were added for reinforcing the walls. Around the basilica were found many tombs, indicating the funerary character of the building from the middle Byzantine period onwards, a use that continued even after it collapsed, probably in the end of the 15th century.",550,2023,2137,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-11-22 16:46:47.321 +0100,2023-12-06 11:13:02.538 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2038,"Cathars, Catharism, Albigenses, Albigensians, Cathari, Catharistae, ""Pure Christians""",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Cathars were a heterogeneous heretical sect in medieval Europe. The groups and their beliefs have been identified by various names (Cathars, Catharism, Albigenses, Albigensians, Cathari, Catharistae) and the heresy is identified with different groups across history. The term was used in the Late Antiquity to refer to various heresies: ""Cathari"" was used of the Novatianists by Saint Epiphanius and other Greek Fathers, while Augustine used the term ""Catharistae"" to describe a sect of Manichaeans. The term primarily applies to a collection of groups in medieval Europe (12th to 14th centuries) that espoused a gnostic and dualist system of belief that was regarded as heresy by mainstream Christianity in the medieval West (Roman Catholicism) where these beliefs can be traced. The group referred to itself, at times, as ""Pure Christians"". The sect is also referred to as the “Albigensians” or “Albigenses” (after Albi in southern France).

The dualist belief system of Catharism centred on the idea of two eternal and coeval divinities, gods, forces or principles: one good and one evil. Spirits are created by the good and matter by the evil principle. When spirits fell from goodness, they were imprisoned in bodies and in death moved from one to another until their badness was expiated and they could return to heaven. The Cathars rejected the organised Church, its authority, its sacraments, and its interpretation of scripture. The group was extremely strict in its religious practices: rejected marriage, the consumption and use of meat and animal products, and recommended an extreme form of fasting (“endura”) that led to starvation and death. They believed that Christ was an angel with a non-physical body, that He did not suffer and die, and that His redemptive act was to spread the true (Albigensian) doctrine. They lived in two religious casts: a more austere group, the “perfect”, who received their baptism (“consolamentum”) by the laying on of hands by which members recipients became the ""perfecti"", and the ordinary believers who would receive “consolamentum” before dying. 

The belief system was based around Christianity, but also incorporated ideas from  different Christian heretical sects including Sabellianism and Arianism. Similarities of belief can be seen with a number with a number of other heresies with which the group was frequently linked. Catharism was influenced by the Bogomils, a comparable Eastern gnostic dualist sect that emerged in the first Bulgarian empire in the 10th century. Catharism may have developed in Byzantium under influence from Armenia and Persia. Catharism emerged in Germany in the 12th century and also in Italy, primarily in the region of Milan. They appeared in the Languedoc region of France around Albi in the 11th century and were also to be found in the Champagne region. Thirteen clerics were condemned to death at the Council of Orléans in 1022. A crusade and later inquisition was launched in the early 13th century and all traces of Cathars had been expunged by the 14th century.",1000,1300,2138,1422,John Gallagher,2023-11-22 22:54:42.992 +0100,2023-11-26 03:31:38.584 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2039,Psalm 109,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Psalm 109 belongs to the fifth section of the Masoretic text's version of the book of Psalms (Pss 107–150), which begins the third part of the canon of the Hebrew Bible (known as the Writings, or kětûbîm). The book of Psalms (called těhillîm or ""Praises"" in Hebrew) is an anthology comprising psalms of various origins, which were eventually edited into a codified collection. The earliest copies of Psalm 109 were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. It appears in the Great Psalms Scroll (11Q5), which dates to 30–50 CE and reflects a different ordering of the psalms than the MT. It has been categorized as a psalm of individual complaint, the most common type of biblical psalm. Written in poetic language, Psalm 109 is one of 72 psalms in which David's name appears in the superscript, and, like the rest of Psalms, its authorship was traditionally attributed to him. Its actual origins and date of composition are unknown, though some have suggested it exhibits Persian influence, as well as a focus on the (restored) Temple, and thus dates to the late 6th century BCE (Gillingham 2022). Following a brief lament in vv. 2–5, Psalm 109 asks for Yahweh's retribution against those who have attacked the main speaker with false accusations and aggression for no discernible reason. The series of curses that follow in vv. 6–19 may be those of the supplicant or those of his antagonists. The prayer continues with another lament and a request for YHWH's intervention (vv. 20-29), and concludes with the promise that the supplicant will publicly praise YHWH for delivering him.",-1000,50,2240,1532,Jennifer Singletary,2023-11-23 02:28:25.699 +0100,2024-03-06 20:39:58.808 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World

2041,PGM XXXVI (Greek ritual manual),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"PGM XXXVI is an ancient Greek ritual manual dated to the 4th century CE. The papyrus scroll measures 24,3 x 244 cm and was inscribed in 12 columns with 19 ritual instructions. The content of the ritual purposes is diverse and comprises predominantly love spells of attraction and charms to restrain anger, but also charms to break spells, spells to gain favour, and in addition a prayer to Hêlios. Note that even though one of the ritual instructions (lines 102-133) is titled: ""Another divination by fire"" the ritual itself is a love spell of attraction and does not include any kind of divination.
The ritual instructions on the front side mostly comprise exactly one column and seven instructions are accompanied by a detailed figurative drawing. No other Greek magical papyrus contains this many illustrations. 
These drawings are visualisations of the artefacts which have to be manufactured in contexts of the rituals to ensure that the practitioner creates them correctly. The invoked higher powers are very diverse and reflect Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish traditions. For example: A ritual to restrain anger calls upon 20 different angels whose names have to be inscribed on an artefact, here no drawing is provided, while a ritual for attraction invokes Seth-Typhon as sole deity and the accompanying artefact depicts a figure of this deity surrounded by his secret names.
A puzzling feature is that in some cases the depicted illustrations do not match their description within the ritual instructions. This kind of discrepancy is also attested in the Greek ritual manual PGM VII in context of the manufacturing of an artefact for protection, but the difference between description and depiction there is not as significant as in PGM XXXVI. The author of this manual must have realized the deviations but still decided not to address them or make changes. One potential explanation for this decision could be that the text was copied from a template and the priority was to create an exact copy.
PGM XXXVI, 295-311 contains a unique reference in the body of the Greek magical papyri to Sodom and Gomorrah. It reads: "" The heavens of heavens opened, and the angels of God descended and overturned the five cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Segor. A woman who heard the voice became a pillar of salt. You are the sulfur which God rained down on the middle of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim and Segor; you arc the sulfur which served God (...)"" (Translation by E. N.

2042,The Eighth Book Of Moses,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The ""Eighth Book of Moses"" is an ancient ritual manual preserved in several versions in a single Greek papyrus from Egypt (PGM XIII). The codex is dated to the fourth century, the exact findspot is unknown. The Eighth Book of Moses is different from the vast majority of ancient Egyptian and Greek ritual manuals and unique among the corpus of the magical papyri. The common ritual manuals consist of collections of individual rituals for various purposes, like divination, love, success, and health. These rituals contain the secret name, or names, of higher powers which are essential to the successful performance of the rituals. The ritual in the Eighth Book of Moses is different since its main goal is to gain knowledge of such a secret name. This knowledge is gained through a personal encounter with the god who is also expected to reveal to the practitioner details about their future life.
The set-up of the ritual is based on astronomical events. Preparations and initial ritual acts take up a time span of 41 days, including an initiation to the gods of the hours of the day, before finally, on the 42nd day, the main ritual is performed.
The deities involved all have an astronomical or creation context, and the two main invocations either comprise a cosmogony or are addressed to the creator god.
Following the instructions for the ritual, 25 applications of the secret name are listed, each one including short ritual acts and either the pronunciation or the writing of the name.
Modern scholarship predominantly identifies two versions of the Eight Book of Moses in PGM XIII, while a few scholars have argued that the second version actually contains parts of a third one.

2043,"Saint Achillios Basilica, Prespes",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The basilica dedicated to Saint Achilliοs († 330) is located on the homonymous island of Prespes, in north‑west Greece (western Macedonia). It was suggested that it was built after 983 or 986 by the Bulgarian Τsar Samuel for housing the relics of Larissa’s patron Saint Achillios, that Samuel took when he had conquered the city. However, more recently it was pointed out that the excavated elements bear no evidence that could support connection with Tsar Samuel. Instead, an array of evidence bespeaks connection with another person, an ecclesiastical of high rank, the bishop of Ohrid Theofrastos who rebuilt the basilica around 1045, following its destruction by the Alamans. The 10th-century basilica was built on the site of an earlier church, most probably of the 6th century. For a short period it was the seat of the Patriarchate of Bulgaria, following its transfer from Edessa. After the area was reconquered by the Byzantines in 1018 and until the first decades of the 15th century, the church served as the seat of the Bishopric of Ohrid. 
Saint Achillios to whom the basilica is dedicated was born in Cappadocia. He has held the metropolitan seat of Larissa for 35 years, while he was one of the bishops who have participated in the First Council of Nicaea of 325. The Saint has sensed his death requested the preparation of the sarcophagus in which he was going to be buried. His Vita mentions that his cult was forgotten and that his lost relics were rediscovered through divine revelation 300 years later. His cult developed from the 9th century onwards, while it gained widespread popularity in the 10th century, most probably because of the transfer of his relics to Prespes.
The timber-roofed, three-aisled basilica with narthex is preserved today in a ruinous state. The central nave ends at the semi-circular sanctuary with the synthronon. The prothesis and the diakonikon have a cross-in-square plan and they are covered by cylindrical domes. The floor is covered by stone slabs. In the diakonikon was constructed a tomb, probably the one that hosted the relics of Saint Achillios. In the south aisle there are four more tombs, in which very remarkable finds were discovered, such as a piece of a 10th‑century silk gilded cloth with eagles, bespeaking the high rank of the individual to whom it belonged. A tripartite structure of funerary nature, adjacent to the southern wall was added in the late-byzantine period. The entire area south and west of the basilica was used as a cemetery from the 12th to the beginning of the 15th century. The basilica has seven doorways, while the sanctuary was separated from the main church by a presbytery barrier made of marble. The few fragments of the monument’s fresco decoration belong to two distinct phases, each corresponding to the restoration works that have taken place. The aniconic decoration of the apse’s conch belongs to the first decades of the 11th century. More precisely, between the eighteen red arches painted above the synthronon are inscribed in Greek letters the seats of the bishops who belonged to the Archdiocese of Ohrid. The figures of the saints, the Virgin Mary and an angel were painted in the 12th century (second phase). The frescoes in question were detached from the walls of the basilica and were transferred to the Museum of Florina, where they are currently exhibited. The frescoes of the second phase find their closest stylistic parallels to the 12th‑century frescoes of the monuments of the city of Kastoria, also in north-west Greece (western Macedonia).",900,2023,2141,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2023-11-25 11:32:57.820 +0100,2023-12-06 16:33:30.163 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2044,P.Mich.inv. 593 (Coptic ritual manual),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"1. The „Coptic Wizard’s Hoard“
The „Coptic Wizard’s Hoard“ is a modern designation for a group of 21 ancient papyrus leaves of which 20 were inscribed with ritual instructions and one with a textual artefact. Five different scribes were involved in the creation of the texts. Altogether twelve different manuscripts could be identified in which eight individual texts are preserved.

The first modern editor of the texts, Worrell, interpreted the papyri as ""to have been the humble literary stock of a Coptic magician“ (Worrell, 239) while the most recent editor believes the papyri were the ""literary production of a ""magical workshop"" in which several individuals, perhaps working together, produced a written collection of magical texts."" (Mirecki, 436).

The papyri of the ""hoard"" are dated differently. Sanders, quoted in Worrell (1930), 240, estimates a date around 600 CE, Mirecki (in Meyer, Smith (1994), 304) believes the papyri date earlier between the 4th and the 6th century CE, but in his paper published also in 1994, p. 435, Mirecki increases the range to a time span between the fourth and the seventh century CE. See his comments in note 2.
The papyri were acquired as a group in February 1921 in Egypt by Sir Wallis Budge. Nothing is known about the circumstances of their finding and their archaeological context.

2. The main codex: P.Mich.inv. 593
Ten of the papyrus leaves are of the same size, ca. 6 x 6 inches, and constituted a codex. The ""braided cord with which the individual leaves were originally bound into a codex"" (Worrell, 239) is still preserved but the leaves themselves were loose when Worrell published them. This codex was inscribed with 338 lines by three different hands. 
It is debated among scholars if the preserved text in the codex belongs to one ritual comprising two prayer-invocations (Dzwiza 2013, 604-608), or if these two invocations belong to two different rituals (Mirecki 1994, 439-440). Since the second invocation does not comprise any demands nor any ritual instructions or subsequent applications, and because the codex seems to be complete due to the writing in the final lines becoming smaller and more squeezed as if to finish the text on the final leaf, it seems more likely that this second invocation belonged to the same ritual as the preceding texts.

The text is structured into an initial prayer-invocation followed by brief ritual instructions defining the circumstances of the recitation. Subsequently, 32 applications of ""it"" are given, predominantly focusing on physical and mental health, supplemented by various kinds of protection, love and attraction, and profit. The ""it"" seems to refer rather to the ritual as such and not specifically to the initial prayer-invocation.
These applications are then followed by partially repeated brief information concerning the time of performance (""at any time"") and the reminder to keep clean before performing the ritual.
Subsequent to these sections follows another invocation which comprises the most extensive list of ""hidden names"" of higher powers in the Egyptian and Greek magical papyri known to us today: 95 lines.

In opposite to the ancient Greek ritual manuals, which commonly consisted of a compilation of rituals for various purposes, with each ritual usually serving a single purpose and only occasionally multiple goals, the ritual manual from the Coptic wizard's hoard contains a single lengthy ritual followed by a list of its possible applications for a large and diverse number of purposes. Each purpose requires different additional but simple ritual acts and ingredients, based on either the oral recitation or the writing down of (one of the two) invocations over some kind of liquid which then has to be applied in various ways.",300,699,1287,1392,Kirsten Dzwiza,2023-11-26 15:47:28.259 +0100,2023-11-28 01:35:45.270 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2045,PGM I (Greek ritual manual),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"PGM I is an ancient Greek ritual manual belonging to the corpus of the ""Greek magical papyri"" (abbreviated PGM for ""Papyri Graecae Magicae"").
The papyrus scroll is inscribed with three extensive rituals for divination and four shorter sections comprising a prayer of deliverance, two invisibility spells, and a spell for good memory.
The first two divination rituals are focused on gaining a ""paredros"" (πάρεδρος). The Greek term generally means ""sitting beside"" with the noun being translated as ""assessor"". In ancient ritual practice the term ""paredros"" specifically refers to an assistant divinity or familiar spirit serving the practitioner in a variety of contexts. Both instructions in PGM I detail how to treat the paredros while he assists the practitioner.
The third ritual begins with invoking the Greek god Apollon, demanding him to ""come together with Paieon"" - which is also a title of Apollon and later attested as one of his epithets -  to answer the practitioner's question himself, while later on in the ritual the practitioner requests Apollon to send a daimon to answer the questions.
The dating of the papyrus is debated. While earlier scholars suggested a dating between the fourth and the fifth century (Preisendanz 1928, Betz 1986), the most recent publication (Faraone, Torallas Tovar 2023) dates it to the second half of the third century.
The findspot of the ritual manual is unknown. It was purchased in 1857 by Richard Lepsius from the Anastasi collection at the famous auction in Paris.
The scroll measures ca. 80.2 cm in length and ca. 33.5 cm in hight. It was cut into two pieces in modern times which were initially kept at the ""Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung"" in Berlin (Germany) under the inventory numbers P. 5025 A and P. 5025 B. Following the Second World War, the first part of the papyrus was relocated to the Muzeum Narodowe in Warsaw where it is still kept today under the accession number 140159.",251,499,1287,1392,Kirsten Dzwiza,2023-11-27 20:41:09.425 +0100,2024-01-05 21:54:39.139 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Christ Way Ministries International (CWMI) is more prevalent in the Southwestern part of Nigeria but there are scattered branches in the Midwestern Nigeria and a new branch in Australia. There are diaspora members in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Canada.  
A brief background history of the Hospital Christian Fellowship that led to the formation of Christ Way Church is in order. Hospital Christian Fellowship began as a result of the activities of some young Christian graduates from Universities in Nigeria in the middle of the 1970s, who found jobs in the teaching hospital, and began a fellowship group in Ilé-Ifè. This fellowship group, which started specifically in 1976, comprised of young people from various denominations (Anglican, Baptist, and Methodist,), who were mainly hospital workers in Ilé-Ifè. Their goal was to meet and discuss the Bible and evangelize their immediate hospital environment. The names of these young graduates at that time are: Bádé Nwakpa (a Pharmacist), Niyi Arówólò (an Engineer), Philip O. Ògúnnówò (a Medical Doctor), Christopher Òpápéjú (a Secondary School teacher) and his wife OpéOlúwa Òpápéjú (a hospital secretarial staff) and finally Uche Onwudiegu (a Medical Doctor). At its initial stage, the group adopted a rotational presidency. Niyi Arówólò was the first president; at the expiry of his tenure, Philip O. Ògúnnówò took over from him and was the president until when Samuel Odúnlámì Oríòkè joined the group in 1983. In October, 1983, Odúnlámì Oríòkè took over as the president after a three-day fast and he maintained the position until 1992 when the fellowship changed its status to a Church. 
The hospital group met for their fellowship activities on the premises of the Seventh Day Adventist (henceforth SDA) Hospital, which the Federal Government acquired from the SDA mission and made an extension of the Ife University Teaching Hospital Complex (IUTHC), to train medical students. The group met on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Tuesdays were for Bible study, while Thursdays were for prayer meetings. The fellowship was meeting inside one of the School of Nursing’s classrooms. When the classroom was in use by the School of Nursing, the fellowship group often moved to other available venues, such as the General Outpatient Department (GOPD) or the corridor of the Hospital Laboratory Department. During the early days of the meetings, the hospital management did not oppose the activities of the members of the group nor did they interfere with their meetings, until the group grew. 
Until Odúnlámì Oríòkè joined in 1983, the Hospital Christian Fellowship (HCF) had just a few members, no more than 15 in all. By the time he joined the group, he introduced radical evangelism within and outside the hospital premises. What is meant by radical evangelism here is the use of different methods such as tract distribution (especially Four Spiritual Laws), bus evangelism, and drama evangelism and so on, to present the gospel to the people. Evangelism was no longer confined to the four walls of the hospital; coupled with bed-to-bed hospital evangelism, there was the house-to-house evangelism, which took the group out of the hospital premises into the community around the hospital. 
Some members of the SDA church became members of the fellowship. This was the beginning of the travail of the fellowship, because the SDA Church’s council rose up and in fact instigated the hospital management to take a stand against the fellowship. The leaders of the fellowship at the time who were also medical doctors in the same hospital pleaded with the hospital management. The matter dragged on until the end of 1986 when the fellowship was eventually kicked out of the hospital premises. 
Some of the members who were head teachers at the SDA Grammar School (High School) gave the leadership of the fellowship permission to use the school’s classrooms for its weekly activities. In 1988, when the Federal Government of Nigeria returned back the hospital and the school initially taken from them,   the SDA church council served the Fellowship with a note to vacate the premises. This meant that the group was going to lose its identity by striking out the phrase, “Hospital Christian,” from its name. When the fellowship moved from the hospital premises to the school premises, many non-hospital workers, such as Akin Ìgè, T.O. Oyèbísí, Túndé Okùnadé, and other influential individuals, had joined the group and also occupied leadership positions of the fellowship. Some members of the fellowship who belonged to the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Obalùfòn, Ilé-Ifè, appealed to their church’s council to grant permission for the fellowship to hold its weekly meetings on Methodist property. The Church Council granted temporary permission in 1988. The fellowship changed its name to Christ Way Fellowship (CWF) at the end of the year 1988.  Because the permission granted the fellowship was not stipulated in writing, some members of the Methodist Church who felt threatened by the activities of the fellowship complained about the inconvenience created by the CWF.
The CWF moved out of the Methodist Church at the end of 1989 and established its home where its present headquarters is located at Temipemi Street, Iredapo Quarters, Ilé-Ifè. The place is a three-acre land with an old church and an uncompleted apartment complex within it. The place was bought from its original owner, who was also using it for the church’s activities. The fellowship leaders, having purchased this property where fellowship activities could be held without any hindrance, began to operate as a pseudo-church. I use the word pseudo here because the organization had already been operating as a church without any official recognition by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Fellowship activities were no longer restricted to two days of the week, but were extended to about four days, namely Mondays, Prayer Meetings; Tuesdays, Bible Study; Thursdays, Deliverance Hour, and Sundays, Home Cell leaders’ meetings (House Fellowship). Home Cell was already a part of the programs of the HCF when they met at the hospital premises. Seeing all these kinds of activities, many church leaders in the town of Ilé-Ifè had begun to insinuate that Odún Oríòkè, the leader of the CWF, was already nursing the ambition to start a church. Maybe they were correct, as events that led to the formation of the church confirmed what the public and some members of the Orthodox churches had already suspected.",1992,2023,2147,1533,Enoch Gbadegesin,2023-12-06 11:47:21.171 +0100,2024-01-24 19:15:13.646 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2054,Christ Apostolic Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The church, Christ Apostolic Church is reputed to be the first Pentecostal church to have emerged from the shore of Nigeria. The church  was started through the effort of individuals who desire apostolic power and reawakening of the church like the biblical apostolic age. Prominent among the pioneers of the church are Oba/Pastor Isaac Akinyele, Pastor David Ogunleye Odubanjo, Joseph Sadare, Miss Sophia Odunlami and Evangelist Joseph Ayo Babalola. These men and women were part of the individuals who laid the foundation of what is today known as Christ Apostolic Church.  Beginning from  the Church missionary society of Our Saviours' Anglican church in Ijebu Ode in 1918, a group of people formed a prayer society called  ""Egbe Aladura"" meaning prayer society/group. This prayer society/group spearheaded by Joseph B. Sadare was forced to move out of the Anglican church as her practices  were considered antithetical to the doctrine of Anglican  church.  In the year 1930, there was an outbreak of revival through Evangelist Joseph Ayo Babalola in Oke Oye Ilesha. This revival signaled a new era for the group as large number of people joined them as members. .As this  revival attracted a large number of people to the group, it also attracted persecution for them from the mission church and government. However, the group kept waxing strong in all fronts. The group  through the effort of Pastor DO Odubanjo was affiliated to the Faith Tabernacle of America.  The relationship was soon  severe  with the Faith tabernacle of the  America as a result of irreconcilable differences that broke up among the leaders of the church  in America .The group  sought for alliance with the British Apostolic Church in Bradford.  On 23rd September 1931, three missionaries  who were representatives  of the British church arrived  in Nigeria. In November 1931 first seven leaders of the group were ordained as the Pastor of the church. The church was formally incorporated and registered by the government as Christ Apostolic Church in the year 1943. It was the first indigenous church to be registered in Nigeria. 
The church believes in the power of prayer, holiness living, divine healing, all sufficient God who is able to provide without going into debt or borrowing.  The church also involve in regular bible study, prayer meetings , keeping prayer vigil and tarrying meeting for the Holy Spirit..

2056,Great Mosque at Kilwa,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Great Mosque at Kilwa (Kis. Msikiti Mkuu wa Kilwa) is a congregational mosque on the island of Kilwa (Kilwa Kisiwani), currently located in Tanzania. It is important because it served as the most important mosque in the medieval city of Kilwa, the capital of the Sultanate of Kilwa (c.950-1505CE). Its origins like lie in the 10th century CE, but multiple additions and renovations were made over the years as the sultanate grew more prosperous and in response to exigencies of maintenance. The northern prayer hall likely represents the earliest phase of construction (11th-12th cen. CE) and is composed of 16 bays supported by 9 pillars of coral and timber. The surviving structure of the mosque is one of coral limestone. The mosque currently lies in ruin, with many of its domes collapsed, but enough of the structure remains to indicate its size and features when in use. The mosque was modified in the 13th century CE, but major renovations took place in the 14th century CE under Sultan al-Hassan ibn Sulaiman (r.1310-1333CE). Al-Hassan added a southern extension capped by a huge dome, which was described by Ibn Battuta when he visited the city in 1331 CE. The vaulted ceilings and domes of the mosque are held aloft by coral limestone pillars. Ibn Battuta's descriptions of the mosque should be treated with caution, as he describes the mosque as constructed out of timber while archaeological evidence indicates that stone was used to construct the mosque as early as the 11th-12th centuries CE. The mosque is one of the largest mosques constructed during the medieval Swahili civilization (1100-1500CE). Other than its remarkable size, the mosque shares many features with other mosques constructed during the Swahili period. For instance, all Swahili mosques constructed during the medieval period, including the Great Mosque at Kilwa, were constructed out of coral rag held together with mud and lime mortar. The mosque was damaged by an earthquake in 1331, but its final ruination came about when renovations were attempted in the 18th century CE, leading to the partial collapse of its roof and its abandonment. The mosque lies in ruin to this day and serves as a major tourist attraction. Archaeological work has taken place around the mosque. More recently, the Zamani Project undertook to 3D scan and document the mosque.",950,1800,2151,1375,Akshay Sarathi,2023-12-11 22:43:54.048 +0100,2023-12-13 03:47:23.092 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2057,Paskuwatti’s Ritual to Cure Sexual Dysfunction,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Paskuwatti’s ritual is an invitation to the Hittite goddess Uliliyassi to assist a man who is unable to perform sexually with a woman. The ritual manuscript is a detailed description, told in the first person, of the ritual performed by Paskuwatti, an Arzawan woman (of far west Anatolia, or what is modern-day Turkey). Only one manuscript of the ritual has survived, KUB 7.8 + KUB 9.27 (+) KUB 7.5 (CTH 406), which dates to the thirteenth century. However, the composition itself was likely first written ca. 1400 BCE. The manuscript tablet’s findspot is not known. Because there is one known extant copy of the original composition, no variations in the ritual are known. Some of the motifs and themes within the ritual reflect those of other rituals within the Hittite tradition and culture, but the composition is unique in terms of its purpose as well as its form, with an extended prayer embedded within the ritual description. The composition was recorded by Paskuwatti and acquisitioned by Hittite scribes at the direction of their king – suggesting that the ritual was deemed significant by the royal house as a suitable intervention in the case that a male member of the house was unable to perform sexually. In this sense, the ritual is used as needed for the cure of sexual disfunction. 
The ritual itself is performed by Paskuwatti in three days’ time. All that are involved are Paskuwatti, an assistant, and the patient. It begins in the patient’s home, where the materials necessary for the ritual are prepared, and then the rites are performed away from human habitation. Incantations and offering rites to Uliliyassi are performed in alternating sequence as the goddess is invited to aid the patient by having sex with him. Next, the patient returns home for an incubation period in which he hopes that Uliliyassi appears to him in his dreams. The incubation period involves entreaties to the goddess, sacrifice of a sheep for a ritual meal, and checking in with the ritualist to report on the goddess’s appearance. The ritual is repeated if it fails. The patient promises that he will worship Uliliyassi as his personal goddess if he is cured of sexual impotence.",-1400,-1200,2249,1539,Brandon Brown,2023-12-11 23:49:54.887 +0100,2024-03-04 18:59:30.162 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World
2058,Djinguereber Mosque,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Djinguereber Mosque, also known as the Mosquée de Djinguereber in French, is a large mud-brick mosque and Islamic learning center located in city of Timbuktu, Mali. Records state that it was constructed in 1327CE under the patronage of the emperor of Mali, Musa I (aka Mansa Musa) (r.c.1312-1337), who is said to have given the architect, Abu Ishaq Al Sahili 200kg (or 40,000 mithqals) of gold as payment for the project. However, this remains an apocryphal tale and there currently exists no way to verify it. 

The entire structure is constructed of mud brick like many other West African mosques (especially the Great Mosque of Djenne). However, in the 1960s a portion  of the northern façade of the Djinguereber Mosque was reinforced using alhore stone (a local limestone used extensively in construction in and around Timbuktu). The minaret is also constructed of limestone but covered in mud. The mud bricks of which the  Djinguereber Mosque is constructed are composed of mud, straw, sand, and water. Timber supports are also used throughout the structure. The  Djinguereber Mosque houses one of the madrassas associated with the University of Timbuktu, a learning institution of great pedigree and antiquity in the region. Three mosques/madrassas associated with the University of Timbuktu are the Sankore Mosque (constructed in 989CE), the  Djinguereber Mosque (constructed 1327CE), and the Sidi Yahya Mosque (constructed c.1400CE). The University and its associated madrassas were badly affected by the Saadian invasion and conquest of the Songhai Empire in the 1590s CE. Scholars from Timbuktu were forcibly marched across the desert to Morocco. Only one returned to Timbuktu, decades later. The mosques/madrassas of Timbuktu house an impressive collection of medieval Arab texts, a testament to the reputation of medieval Timbuktu as a great medieval center of learning. More recent tragedies have been associated with the Djinguereber Mosque was a stampede in 2010 during the festival of Mawlid (the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad), in which around 30 people were killed and countless other injured. In 2012, militants associated with the group Ansar Dine (""Defenders of Faith"") took over the city and began systematically destroying the mud-brick tombs associated with the mosques of the city. They destroyed 16 tomb-shrines associated with ancient holy men. The Djinguereber Mosque itself, however, was relatively undamaged. Other factors affecting the Djinguereber Mosque's preservation are the increased desertification and consequent uptick in sand activity in the region. The trees that provided timber for the mosques have also vanished from the region due to climate change. However, a corps of specialist mud-brick craftsmen exists to maintain the mosques of Timbuktu, even though the task seems increasingly difficult with each passing year. Some funds have been allotted for the preservation of the Djinguereber Mosque due to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture, for instance, funded a 4-year project to repair and rehabilitate the mosque in 2006.

Their population is about 471,000. From oral history, the town was founded by Oranmiyan the last son of Oduduwa, the great ancestor of the Yoruba people. Generally, the religious and political history of the people can be traced to their migration from Ile-Ife. But more specifically, they have a ritual tradition which is spectacular. It is attached to Sango and Oya festivals. Oya was the wife of Sango during his life time. In cosmological understanding of Orisa belief, she was such an outstanding figure among the female deities. Her imposing pedigree therefore makes her group to be unique.  The group showcases her festival with Bata drum as it makes it distinct for ritual practices. This unique ritual practice of the Oya group is shared with the Sango group. Oral tradition has it that Oya was one of the deities sent to the earth by Olodumare for creation and earth-remodelling. She is reputed for her fearlessness and believed to live in or inhabit the wind. Oya is known for her reputable character as a warrior and as a mother that loves children. Oya is a goddess that professes love in her character. This is seen from the way she stood with her husband, Sango, in the time of crisis. She is a mother who protects her children from any form of danger because she accords wealth to them and does not support hypocritical acts and betrayal. Rather, she loves people who are truthful and those who possess a pure heart. A mythical narrative made it clear that Oya was so faithful to to Sango, her husband that she alone of all his wives accompanied him in his flight towards Nupeland in his time of crisis. Oya, according to the myth could not bear the pain of her husband's disappearance after his death that she committed suicide. This act was her way of sharing in her husband's destiny. she died in her hometown, Ira and was thus deified. The Oya group has a well developed religious cult on the River Niger in Nigeria to symbolize her heroic acts. The cult is still devoted to their practices till today. While Sango is recognized as the spirit of thunder and lightning, Oya is known to be the spirit of wind. Sango is acknowledged for fierce tornadoes and intense thunderstorm while Oya is reputed for her windstorms which uproot trees and destroy houses. Oya is seen as a deified heroine and never spoken of as dead. Her votaries still belief that she is still living. She is not dead as she is both a deity and an ancestor who protects and watches over her living children or followers. The Indigenous religious festival, Ìṣẹ̀ṣe is performed by her group. This has been incorporated into some new religious traditions among some African groups in the Diaspora.",1800,1900,1995,1460,olusegun oladosu,2023-12-15 14:28:33.366 +0100,2024-03-06 19:51:18.186 +0100,Personal Expertise
2063,The Mosque Cluster at Gedi,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Gedi mosques are a group of religious structures located in the heart of ancient Swahili city of Gedi, also known as Gede. Gedi was likely occupied between the 11th and 17th centuries CE, and was a typical Swahili ""stone town"" located on the East African coast in modern Kenya. The ruins of Gedi include a walled town and its suburbs. The main built area consists of houses, a palace, and some mosques. Two of these mosques have been identified as ""Great Mosques"" by Pradines (2003). Open areas in the settlement have been identified as zones where structures constructed of perishable materials were located. Like most of the surviving structures at Gedi, the mosques were constructed using coral limestone extracted from the Indian Ocean and cemented with mud-lime mortar. Foundations tend to be about a foot deep and not much wider than the walls they support. The mosques and other structures were built along a planned grid. The mosques are associated with wells and washing facilities for use before (and after?) worship. The mosques are not associated with minarets, breaking with common practice elsewhere in the Muslim world. This could be due to Ibadi influence in the region. Gedi's mosques were planned with anterooms flanking a central chamber. The roof of the mosques were likely supported by wood beams and square stone pillars. The largest mosque at Gedi has three entrances and three rows of square stone pillars. Breaking with the generally aniconic decoration of Swahili mosques, this mosque has a relief of a spear placed next to a shield on its spandrel above one of its entrances. The east entrance's architrave is decorated with a geometric herringbone pattern. All the mosques of Gedi have a decorated mihrab on their north walls, the direction of Mecca. The second largest mosque of the city seems to be older than its larger counterpart. This second mosque was constructed in the 12th century before being reconstructed and expanded in the 13th and 14th centuries. This second mosque measure 26m in length, north to south. Like many mosques of medieval Swahili settlements, the mosques of Gedi are associated with tombs constructed of limestone, mortar, and plaster. These tombs often are constructed with pillars topping them. These tombs are constructed with recessed decorative panels. There are four large pillar tombs at Gedi, but only one is dated by an inscription - 1399CE.",1000,1650,2154,1375,Akshay Sarathi,2023-12-15 23:08:38.352 +0100,2023-12-15 23:10:15.068 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2067,Pool of Siloam,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Pool of Siloam was constructed in the mid-first century BCE and remained in use until the city was destroyed by the Roman army during the First Revolt in 70 CE. This pool was constructed at the base of the city's Eastern Ridge whose southernmost rock outcropping can be seen hanging above the pool. It sat in Jerusalem's Central Valley, near its convergence with the city's other two large valleys, the Kidron and Hinnom. This natural catchment basin would receive water flow during the rainy season and refill the pool. However, the main source of water was the nearby Siloam Tunnel. A rock-cut channel from the tunnel's outlet which directed spring water into the Siloam Pool.

Archaeological work has progressively uncovered pieces of the Pool of Siloam since the 1890s, and it continues to be excavated today. Although only three sides of the pool are known, it seems to have been four sided and included a portico on at least its northwestern side. The pool consisted of a series of steps that led people into the water below. The steps were built in increments of four with a wide step in between. To date, three staircases are known, and the depth of the bottom of the pool has not yet been determined. 

After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, many of the large stone slabs from the pool were robbed out and used as building stone elsewhere in the city. Some remains of the pool were preserved due to water erosion which covered the pool with thick deposits. This area was later developed as a garden and became known in Arabic as Birket al-Hamra (""The Red Pool"").

Many scholars believe the pool was used for ritual immersion by the Jewish community in Jerusalem and those who arrived in the city for the pilgrimage festivals. The Temple Mount is located north of the Siloam Pool and could be accessed by a road that traversed the Central Valley in a north-south manner. Ritually purified worshipers could ascend the sacred mountain from below and approach the temple to participate in the sacrificial cult. The Pool of Siloam undoubtedly attracted crowds of people and carried a social function as well.

The pool is mentioned in ancient literary sources. The New Testament Gospel of John describes a miraculous healing where Jesus placed mud on a blind man's eyes and instructed him to go wash in the pool (John 9). Upon washing the mud from his eyes, the man's sight was restored. The Mishnah describes a libation that was taken from the pool and poured into a basin at the temple altar during the festival of Sukkot (M. Sukkah 4).",-80,70,2162,1535,Chandler Collins,2023-12-16 19:41:46.181 +0100,2023-12-21 21:18:04.622 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2068,Mwanagori Cave,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Mwanagori Cave is a limestone karst cavern that lies on the road between Jambiani and Makunduchi, close to Shuungi. The cave is inset within a limestone cliff and is surrounded by a small grove that has been deemed sacred. The entrance to the cave is narrow and require sure-footedness, and is partially screened by rows of boulders. The ritual significance of this cave and the antiquity of human use is evidenced by the the deep wearing and polishing of the stones leading into the cave. Within the cave, in a dark recess lies a pool of fresh water, near which a spirit or Shetani is supposed to reside. The word ""Shetani"" is etymologically linked with the Arabic word ""Shaitan"" (""satan/demon""). This places Mwanagori squarely in the Zanzibari pattern in which caves with a pool/spring of fresh water are considered sacred due to the presence/residence of spirits known as Shetani. In Zanzibari practice, the shetani are venerated even though the population of the island is overwhelmingly Muslim. The syncretic nature of Swahili Islam allows for the practice of pre-/non-Islamic religious traditions by local Muslims. Mwanagori Cave is cared for by the local community, and has a healer known as an mganga (pl. waganga) in charge of the rites performed there. The rites and rituals performed by the mganga at Mwanagori remain secret, just as they are at other caves on Zanzibar. However, evidence for the practice of rituals at Mwanagori exists in the form of offerings left for the Shetani. These offerings often take the form of food, drink, and incense. There is also a tradition of tying strips of cloth (especially white and red) to the trees near the cave. This practice is akin to what takes place at the nearby Kuumbi Cave, which is also managed by an mganga and is visited by the pious among the local community, who arrive to leave offerings of food, incense, and cloth. The rituals and rites conducted in caves like Mwanagori are considered part of the intangible heritage of Zanzibar, but they are increasingly under threat from the tourism industry. Tour operators regularly remove offerings from caves and prevent the waganga and the local community from performing their rituals for fear that this performance of ""witchcraft"" will drive away tourists. No archaeological research has been conducted at Mwanagori as of December 2023. This cave is important to the local communities of the nearby settlements of Makunduchi, Jambiani, and Shuungi. The disruption caused to these communities by the expansion of the tourist industry could harm cave shrines like Mwanagori.",0,2023,2163,1375,Akshay Sarathi,2023-12-17 20:39:21.184 +0100,2023-12-17 23:08:42.738 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2070,Overcomers Evangelical Mission International (Ori-Oke Asegun),43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry on the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International, commonly known as Ori-Oke Asegun, which is a vibrant religious organisation with its roots firmly planted in Ilé-Ifè, Nigeria. Founded by Prophet/Evangelist Abiodun Oladele, the ministry has grown to become a significant spiritual force, impacting the lives of its members and the surrounding communities. Prophet/Evangelist Abiodun Oladele serves as the visionary and spiritual leader of the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International. With a compelling personal story of divine calling and obedience to the divine will, Prophet Oladele's teachings emphasise the power of faith, prayer, and divine intervention in overcoming life's challenges. The ministry is characterised by distinctive practices, most notably the emphasis on the colour white. Prophet Oladele, following divine guidance received in a dream, adheres to an all-white attire during ministry activities, including the use of a white microphone. This commitment to the colour white symbolises purity, obedience, and the manifestation of God's power, which have seen so many of his followers adorning themselves in the use of white colour. 
The ministry conducts regular church services and gatherings where members come together for worship, prayer, and teachings. The services are known for their spiritual intensity, with an emphasis on the manifestation of God's power, healing, and deliverance. The teachings revolve around the scriptures, particularly emphasising the power of Christ Jesus to heal any kind of diseases whatsoever. Prophet Oladele, having experienced divine encounters and revelations, incorporates prayer and spiritual interventions for healing. The ministry has witnessed reported cases of miraculous healings, further reinforcing its reputation as a place where the supernatural is believed to be at work.
The ministry has expanded beyond its initial establishment in Ilé-Ifè. Branches have been established in various locations, including Osun State, with notable locations such as Ipetumodu and Gbongan. Additionally, within Ilé-Ifè, the ministry has extended its reach with branches in Aworeni, Opa, Eleyele, Akarabata, Abajaolowu (Modakeke), Ondo road, Arubiewe, and Epe. This geographical expansion reflects the ministry's commitment to reaching and impacting diverse communities with its spiritual message. Beyond religious activities, the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International engages in community outreach. These outreach programmes serve as meeting points for individuals to gather, fostering a sense of community and providing opportunities for people to study the Bible and engage in spiritual discussions.
It could be said that the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International, under the leadership of Prophet/Evangelist Abiodun Oladele, stands as a testament to the transformative power of faith and obedience. With its distinctive practices, commitment to spiritual growth, and a focus on community impact, the ministry continues to play a significant role in the spiritual landscape of Ilé-Ifè and beyond.",2003,2018,2017,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,2023-12-19 17:17:38.000 +0100,2024-02-22 14:22:33.629 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2071,"Songs of the Sage (4Q510, 4Q511)",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Songs of the Sage, a collection of hymns attributed to the Maskil (Hebrew word for instructor or sage – in this case referring to a sectarian Jewish leader of the community at Qumran) for the sake of warding or protection of the prayerful against evil, is an exemplar of early Jewish apotropaic prayer. The two known witnesses to the composition, 4Q510 and 4Q511, are dated between 30 BCE and 30 CE. Of the two manuscripts, 4Q510 contains only a few legible lines within its fragments, whereas 4Q511 consists of 226 fragments, yielding the majority of the textual material associated with the Songs. The fragments’ composition style, language, and format hint that the Songs were used in group study or performance as part of a communal ritual. Though there is no reference to the specific occasion of the ritual’s performance, scholars think that the sectarian community at Qumran may have regularly recited apotropaic prayers, of which the Songs of the Sage is a key example. At least three songs are included within the text (though there are indications of several others), and all contain references to the Maskil. At least three of the Songs feature apotropaic incantations or other phrases used to prevent harm from evil spirits and demons. Throughout the texts, praises and thanksgivings are interwoven along with incantations primarily for the sake of praising the Jewish God, with the secondary feature of serving as magic “words of power” that invoke fear in demons and spirits, providing protection from them. In this way, the Songs differ from the contemporary Jewish magical practices involving addresses to the Jewish God and invocation of his name(s) for divine protection. The Songs share some elements of other apotropaic prayer in Second Temple and rabbinic Judaism – protection from Satan/evil, protection from sin and forgiveness for it, sanctification, and the inspiration of God’s knowledge and laws to his followers. Yet they stand apart for the ways they reflects the culture of the Qumran community in their dualistic and apocalyptic framework and references to beliefs and practices characteristic of the sect.",-30,30,2248,1539,Brandon Brown,2023-12-19 19:27:11.912 +0100,2024-02-27 21:29:34.109 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World
2072,Unguja Ukuu Amulet Seal,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Archaeological excavations in 2018 at the site of Unguja Ukuu (Zanzibar) yielded a small rock-crystal cabochon amulet seal with the Arabic word ""lillah"" (""for God"") inscribed in the Kufic script on its domed surface. The amulet was discovered in contexts dating to the 8th-9th centuries CE,  making it one of the oldest Islamic artifacts discovered thus far that far south along the East African coast. The word inscribed on its surface is the oldest piece of writing thus far recovered from Zanzibar, predating the Kizimkazi Mosque inscription by a a few centuries. This amulet seal was likely set in jewelry worn on one's person, as indicated by the faint discoloration visible on the flat surface of the amulet. Examination with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed that the inscription was made with a rotary tool. At some later point, a diagonal spall was removed across the inscription. At first, the spall was assumed to have been removed on purpose, reflecting a deliberate defacing of the inscription. However, upon SEM examination of the spall, it was revealed to have detached along a natural crystal plane in the rock crystal. Thus, it is impossible to say whether the spall was removed on purpose or not, but it is possible that the eventual defacement of the inscription by the spall led to the discard of the amulet seal by its original users. This artifact is classed as an ""amulet seal"" because it belongs to a class of Islamic amulets with inscriptions written backward, just as one would on a stamp/cylinder seal. It is unlikely that this object was used as a seal because the inscription is so shallow. Rather, the inscription written backwards on this artifact could reflect a desire to preserve the magic of the amulet. Islamic amulets often display inscription written backwards. The writing on Islamic amulets usually mentions the name of God (Allah) or the name of the user, and many times is written backward or is composed of strings of letters that do not form words. The rock crystal material of the Unguja Ukuu amulet seal is in keeping with a class of Islamic amulet seals that were associated with rain-making magic. Rock crystal is associated in Islam with the waters of heaven, and thus forms an important material from which amulets and other religious objects are made. The source of the rock crystal used to make the amulet remains unknown as rock crystal cannot be traced chemically. The discovery of this amulet in what was an ancient garbage dump or midden remains inexplicable, as such sacred objects are often deposited in ritually important spaces, like mosque courtyards or cemeteries. Its discovery in a midden could indicate that it was lost unintentionally by its user.",700,900,2165,1375,Akshay Sarathi,2023-12-19 21:10:30.760 +0100,2023-12-19 21:10:30.760 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Beginning late in 1905 in French Niger at Kobkitanda, the uprising quickly expanded to Satiru in British northern Nigeria at the beginning of 1906. Disgruntled peasants, runaway slaves, and radical clerics who opposed both the colonial administrations and indigenous authorities made up the Mahdist supporters of the uprising. The 'ulama, affluent businessmen, and nobility were not known to be in favor. Strong class and, consequently, racial divisions were thus mirrored in the uprising.

2076,Kizimkazi Dimbani Mosque Inscription,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The mosque at Kizimkazi Dimbani, located on the southern coast of the island of Unguja (Zanzibar) is important because it boasts an inscription that dates to 1107CE and is one of the earliest extant mosques on the Swahili coast. The inscription is  located on the northern wall of the mosque and runs into the mihrab. It reads as follows: ""This is what has ordered the high and very great Shaikh es-Saiyid Abu 'Imran Musa, son of al Hasan, son of Muhammad . . .—may Allah grant him long life and destroy his enemies—about building this mosque on a Sunday of the month Dhu-lqa'da in the year five hundred (A.D. 1107)."" To the right of the mihrab is a quote from the Quran (ch. ix, 18). The alcove of the mihrab is inscribed with verses 80-82 of ch. xvii of the Quran. Two rosettes are placed above the mihrab. The rosette on the right contains verse 24 of ch. xiii of the Quran, while the rosette on the left has not been fully deciphered. A later inscription (placed atop an erased portion of the original inscription) says that the mosque was rebuilt in 1770 CE.

This inscription is important not only because it is evidence for the early presence of Islam on Zanzibar (1107CE), but also because it is written in the floriate and plaited Kufic script. This suggests that a foreign craftsperson/calligrapher was involved in the placing of this dedicatory inscription in the mosque. The construction of the mosque itself has been linked to immigrant Near Eastern populations rather than as a product of local construction.

2080,Daily Communal Petitions (Tefillah/Amidah),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Tefillah (“the Prayer"") or Amidah (“standing [prayer]"") is a communal prayer of rabbinic Judaism, established by the Mishnah for each service, morning, afternoon, and evening (and an additional service on festive days). It consists of praise, petition, and thanksgiving to God. With a quorum, the prayer is recited by each individual participant and then repeated by a designated prayer leader (except in the evening). The Tefillah is divided into three sections — praise of the divine upon entering into God's presence (3 paragraphs); on weekdays, petitions for particular human needs (12/13 paragraphs), replaced by a single non-petitionary paragraph about the day on Sabbaths and holy days; and thanksgiving when concluding interaction with the divine (3 paragraphs) — with each paragraph of the prayer ending with “blessed are you, O LORD” followed by a name of God or a divine role. While the weekday Tefillah consists of 18 paragraphs in the version from the Land of Israel in late antiquity, the Babylonian tradition lengthens it to 19.  Thematic expansions are also made to the service on occasions such as minor festivals, fast days, or the New Year. The language of the Tefillah was heavily influenced by the Bible. Its thematic structure and some language were fixed by the third and fourth centuries CE — with variations increasingly less tolerated over the centuries. There is evidence that the Tefillah/Amidah was being used in rabbinic circles as early as the late first century, but transmission was oral. Full prayer books emerge only in the late 9th c. (Seder Rav Amram Gaon); better manuscripts exist for the Siddur Rav Saadia Gaon (c. 925).",50,1000,2282,1539,Brandon Brown,2023-12-23 22:48:41.150 +0100,2024-02-28 20:03:37.101 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World
2081,Ben Sira 36:1–22,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This text is a selection from the book of Ben Sira, a collection of proverbs and teachings written by a Jewish sage in Hebrew in the 2nd century BCE and later translated into Greek (likely in Alexandria) by an author claiming to be his grandson. Ben Sira participates in the Near Eastern tradition of wisdom literature, drawing its most direct inspiration from the book of Proverbs. Over time, Ben Sira became familiar within the rabbinic Jewish community — it is cited by the Talmud on multiple occasions — and has been included in some versions of the Christian Bible as either “Sirach” or “Ecclesiasticus” (its Latin name). Though the Book of Ben Sira was not canonized within the Jewish tradition, there are resonances to the text in Jewish literature in the late antique and medieval periods. The oldest preserved versions of Ben Sira are in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Syriac. Though they bear the same message, some slight differences exist in the translations. Six medieval manuscripts were found in the Cairo Genizah in 1896, and more fragmentary ancient copies dating to 50-70 BCE were found at the Dead Sea. This selection is a prayer of petition to God to deliver Israel and bring misfortune to its enemies. It is written in poetic form and interweaves praise of the nature and power of God with petitions for his aid for the Jewish people.",-200,100,2267,1539,Brandon Brown,2023-12-23 22:54:04.465 +0100,2024-03-06 21:48:03.165 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World

2086,Mathnawi ma'nawi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Ottoman Empire, which valued and promoted Persian culture, was itself a bridge of civilizations upon which the Persian literary corpus reached its westernmost geographical extent in the Balkans. Bosnia and Herzegovina and its environs (the Balkans) were not simply a part of the Islamic cultural orbit, but contributed actively to the Persian literary tradition. In addition to its artistic and literary character, the Persian literary corpus was also highly valued for its moral and didactic education, as well as Tasavvuf's spiritual teachings. Persian literary tradition appears to have been a trans-Islamic mediator of important works of Sufism. Above all was Rumi’s Mathnawī-i ma‘nawī (or Mathnawi), a text which motivated many in the broader Ottoman Empire and, more specifically, Bosnia to learn the Persian language. The Mawlāviyya order, naturally, encouraged the reading and interpreting of the text. In Ottoman society, outside the Ottoman madrasas, Mathnawi regularly entered the tafsir domain as an alter-exegesis, which founded a different hermeneutics with a different register and which offered semantic possibilities beyond those reproduced within the academies of tafsir. Echoes of this past continue to reverberate in the contemporary Muslim culture of the Balkans. Therefore, in these regions, even today, classical Sufi Persian works are still read, especially Rumi's Mathnawi both among educated individuals and in Sufi tekkes (lodges) and khalkas (circles) outside the tekke. This work was not read independently, but in groups with interpretation.

2091,"Kizimkazi Dimbani Mosque, Zanzibar",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The mosque at Kizimkazi Dimbani is located on the island of Unguja (Zanzibar). According to a text inscribed along its northern inner wall, the mosque was constructed by one Shaikh es-Saiyid Abu 'Imran Musa, son of el Hasan, son of Muhammad in 500AH (1107 CE). Along with the dedicatory text are inscribed verses from the Quran. The mosque is important because it is one of the earliest extant mosques still in use this far south along the East African coast. Multiple excavations have taken place at the mosque and its environs, most recently in 2018 by Akshay Sarathi. Sarathi is yet to publish the results of his excavations, but he excavated 13 burials, multiple sherds of imported and local ceramics, shell and glass beads, faunal remains, and floral remains. In 1959, in conjunction with repairs that were conducted at the mosque, Neville Chittick excavated some trenches. He argued that the site was first seriously occupied in the 10th-11th century CE, as evidenced by the presence of sgraffiato ware. The site seems to have been abandoned from the 14th to 18th centuries CE, according to Chittick. The mosque was built atop wattle-and-daub structures that already existed at the site, possibly in association with the freshwater well that lies nearby. The mosque's location may have been chosen because of this well, which could have been considered to have magical properties considering that it provides freshwater so close to the sea. In 1772/73 CE, according to an inscription within the mosque, the structure was repaired and reconstructed, and it seems to have been continuously occupied until the present since its reconstruction. The mosque was associated with some stone structures that may now be demolished. The management of the mosque has been taken over by the Department of Museums and Antiquities of the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, with consultation with the local community. However, a management plan is desperately needed to preserve the mosque given its role in the tourist trade and the deleterious effects of climate change on the structure.",1107,2023,2177,1375,Akshay Sarathi,2023-12-25 22:40:11.248 +0100,2023-12-26 21:29:58.411 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

It comprises 30 individual sections containing ritual instructions and related information. Their focus is on divination and erotic magic, but the manual also contains instructions to release from bonds, for gaining favor and friendship, and for making magical rings. 

The magical texts were inscribed on the back of the papyrus scroll whose front side had been previously inscribed with the Egyptian ""The Myth of the Eye of the Sun"" and animal fables. The older myth and fables are dated to around 100 CE while the later ritual instructions were written down during the first half of the fourth century. 

The papyrus was acquired by J. Anastasi through the antiquities trade and sold by him to the museum in two parts: Part 1 in 1828, part 2 in 1830. Anastasi stated that the papyrus derived from a Theban grave.

The scroll measures ca. 360 cm x 22 cm, it was cut into six pieces in modern times and is now kept at the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden.

2094,Feathered Serpent's cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"The choice of the name ""Feathered Serpent"" is due to the fact that there are translations for most of the Indigenous peoples who have lived in present-day Mexico and the United States of America. While the Nahuatl name ""Quetzalcoatl"" is probably the most well-known by most readers, it is a Late Postclassic and colonial Nahuatl term used mostly in the Highlands of Mexico. In fact, the names ""Kukulkan"" in Maya Tzeltal, ""Qʼuqʼumatz"" in Q'iche' are local versions of the Feathered Serpent.

This onomastic diversity is accompanied by epithets that denote positive and negative attributes, powers, and domains. Speaking of the positive ones, he's considered as creator of humanity, provider of fire and food, patron of artists, announcer of rains, organizer of time and stars, young conquering warrior, priest concerned with rules, etc. About the negative ones, he is the first to sacrifice the gods, claims for human sacrifices. It then becomes Naxcit, Hun Ac El, Kan Tepeu, Nanahuatl, Ce Acatl, Ehécatl, etc. Its own name is the perfect of complementary opposites: the quetzal feathers remind us its heavenly nature, and the coatl or serpent refers to its chthonian aspect.

Despite the cultural, linguistic, and figurative diversity inherent in the Mesoamerican religious Tradition, this entry highlights shared aspects of the Feathered Serpent cult in ancient Mesoamerica, taking into account colonial texts written in Spanish or Nahuatl, pre-Hispanic depictions, and some ethnographic testimonies.",100,1521,2182,1201,Bertrand Lobjois,2023-12-27 23:46:36.285 +0100,2024-01-15 19:46:33.227 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The site participated in the Indian Ocean trade network, as evidenced by excavated Chinese ceramics and Indian Ocean trade beads. While most of the houses were likely constructed of mud and wood and thus have not survived, a couple of large, presumably elite, non-religious structures have survived. However, one of them has identified by locals as a madrassa. There are two mosques on the site, with associated tombs. A possible mausoleum is located at the site as well. Some of the graves are supposed to be of local rulers known as ""Diwanis"", believed to be descendants of Sheikh Ali Muhammad al-Hatim al-Barawi. One mosque is more intact than the other. The larger mosque is noteworthy because of its staircase - rather than tower - minaret. The second, collapsed mosque, has a steeply rising mass of stone masonry, presumably the remains of the collapsed turning staircase minaret. The staircase has also been identified as a minbar. The mihrab of this larger mosque is a recessed chamber in which one person can comfortable stand. The ruination of the mosques makes greater description impossible.

2099,Nation Protecting Shrines,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Nation-protecting shrines, or gokoku jinja, were established in 1939 as regional branches of Yasukuni Jinja. After the Boshin War (1868-9), a new form of national veneration of the war dead began, drawing especially upon Shinto and Confucian traditions. These temporary spirit-summoning (shokon) sites spread and were eventually transformed into permanent shrines for venerating the collective eirei, or ""glorious dead"", of those who had given their life for the emperor and nation. Although nation-protecting shrines were legally Shinto shrines (jinja), they were distinguished from regular Shinto shrines by their veneration of the collective recent dead, their parallel but separate ranking system, and their joint management by the military and home office. The veneration of the war dead at Yasukuni Jinja and the gokoku shrines was one of the most visible manners in which the imperial state mobilized its subjects to war.
During the American occupation of Japan, gokoku shrines were allowed to exist as private religious organizations but were required to strip the term ""nation-protecting"" from their titles. After the occupation, shrines could restore the term to their title, but the new religious framework for governing Shinto shrines largely erased the distinctions between gokoku shrines and regular Shinto shrines. For several years postwar, the war dead continued to be enshrined and in some cases new gokoku shrines were built as local war memorials (ex: Munakata Gokoku Jinja). Today, gokoku shrines have taken various approaches towards their role in contemporary society. Some shrines started enshrining those who died in the line of duty postwar, such as police officers and self-defense force members, while others have remained dedicated only to prewar eirei.",1939,2023,2181,1459,Karli Shimizu,2023-12-30 06:08:02.968 +0100,2024-03-08 10:07:06.995 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The manual is commonly referred to as ""PGM V"" and kept at the British Library in London. It was found in Egypt and is dated to 4th century CE.
Two goals are mentioned within the invocations: ""turn away this daimon!"" and ""Subject to me all daimons, so that every daimon, whether heavenly or aerial or earthly or subterranean or terrestrial or aquatic, might be obedient to me and every enchantment and scourge which is from God."" The ritual is an augmented exorcism which does not only intend to drive out and away a single daimon, but to grant the practitioner power over all daimons.
The addressed and invoked higher power is called ""Headless One"" who is described as: ""(...) Headless One, who created earth and heaven, who created night and day, you who created light and darkness; you are Osoronnôphris whom none has ever seen; you are Iabas; you are Iapos; you have distinguished the just and the unjust; you have made female and male; you have revealed seed and fruits; you have made men love each other and hate each other.""
The ritual comprises the element of self-identification of the practitioner with higher powers, here with Moses, a specific angel, and finally with the invoked higher power himself, the Headless one: ""I am Moysês, your prophet, to whom you have transmitted your mysteries celebrated by Israel""; ""I am the angel / messenger of Pharaoh Osoronnôphris""; ""I am the headless daimon with my sight in my feet"". The meaning of the closing sentence of the invocation is still unresolved: ""I am the Favor oft he Aion, my name is a heart encircled by a serpent, come forth and follow!"" 
This ancient ritual has become one of the most popular rituals in modern magic due to Aleister Crowley and Samuel L.

2110,Thiền viện Trúc Lâm Bình Phước,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Thiền viện Trúc Lâm Bình Phước (translated into English as ""Bamboo Grove Thiền Monastery, Bình Phước"") is located in a commune in Bình Phước province adjacent to the Cambodia border. The temple is closely associated with the Tibetan Drukpa lineage, founded by Naropa over 1,000 years ago. The temple occasionally hosts Drukpa monks (largely from Ladakh) to host Tibetan ceremonies and empowerments while visiting Vietnam. This entry is based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 2023 at Quan Âm Tu Viện, which is the mother temple of Thiền viện Trúc Lâm Bình Phước, and in January 2024, during the visit of Gyalwa Dokhampa and about 25 Drukpa monks, during which time they conducted a well-attended ‘Kilaya Fire puja’ and ‘Drolma Yuldok’ ritual of 21 Taras to remove obstacles and bring about auspiciousness. The temple is a nunnery. The land on which the temple is built was part of Căn cứ Tà Thiết, a major battlefield and military base that the National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam (NLF, Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam) launched their participation for the Spring 1975 General Offensive (Tổng tiến công và nổi dậy mùa Xuân 1975). It is colloquially referred to as a “red address” (địa chỉ đỏ)—a revolutionary site allied with the Communist Party and against the American and South Vietnamese governments. It is part of official nationalist historical reclamation projects (Grossheim 2018). As a former battlefield, it is believed by the local people to be a place of restless ghosts and spirits associated with dead soldiers. As part of the military base’s renovation, Bình Phước Province People’s Committee allocated 60 hectares of land to build Thiền viện Trúc Lâm Bình Phước. The construction began in late 2017 and was completed in early 2020. In 2020, the monastery contained a Mahayana-style main hall, Nhà Địa Tạng (Kṣitigarbha shrine room), Nhà Linh (an outside shrine dedicated to local spirits and dead soldiers), a communal kitchen and residential quarters for nuns. A local business, Đại Nam Joint Stock Company, donated 50 billion VND to the construction of the temple. Its subsidiary company, Đại Nam Bình Dương Construction Company Limited, constructed the temple. Upon completion, the Venerable (Thượng Tọa) Thích Thanh Phong, the standing member of the Central Executive Council of the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS), and the abbot at Vĩnh Nghiêm temple in Hồ Chí Minh City (HCMC), appointed Thích Nữ Huệ Đức, the current abbot at Quan Âm Tu Viện, a syncretic Mahayana-Vajrayana temple in Ho Chi Minh City, to be the abbot of this newly built temple. Thiền viện Trúc Lâm Bình Phước epitomizes Tibeto-Vietnamese syncretism in aesthetics, rituals and teachings. In 2023, the temple constructed a cluster of 15 Tibetan-style meditation villas for short and long-term Vajrayana retreat courses. It is being expanded to 25 villas.

The worship focused on consistent obedience to its directives and offering Animal sacrifices to please its spirit, which in turn guaranteed the success and safety of the people in all their endeavors.

2112,Mengzi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Mengzi 孟子, also known as Mencius or Meng-tzu, was a Chinese philosopher who lived during the Warring States period of Chinese history (around 372–289 BCE). He is considered one of the most important Confucian philosophers and is often referred to as the “Second Sage” after Confucius himself. The collection of dialogues and essays attributed to him, called Mengzi, is an essential part of the Confucian canon, along with the Analects of Confucius.

Mengzi is best known for his assertion of the innate goodness of human nature. He argued that everyone possesses natural tendencies toward goodness and that hostile external circumstances can lead people astray. Mengzi developed the idea of the Four “Beginnings” or “Sprouts” as innate dispositions towards goodness in humans: benevolence (仁 ren), righteousness (義 yi), ritual propriety (禮 li), and wisdom (智 zhi). These dispositions are present in everyone and can be nurtured to reach their full virtue.

Mengzi also emphasized the importance of benevolent governance. A ruler who fails to govern justly could be overthrown, as the mandate to rule was contingent on virtuous rule. He believed that individuals should cultivate their innate moral dispositions through reflection. Finally, Mengzi engaged in philosophical debates with thinkers such as Yangzhu and Mozi, who held contrasting views on human nature and the Way (道dao), defending Confucianism against these rival schools of thought.",-323,-314,467,1548,Lok Chui Choo,2024-01-09 22:40:14.739 +0100,2024-03-19 09:30:30.353 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The group adopted their religious services from a Sufi order initiated by Sheikh Ahmad Tijani in Morocco, who claimed to have adopted it from the Prophet Muhammad's (SAW) directives on the significance of non-obligatory duties impacting the spiritual purity of humanity. The services of the order relied on three fundamental duties, which are the pronouncement of daily repentance (Istigfar), praises (Salat) to the Prophet (SAW), and the word of Allah's unity (Hailalah). Every member is expected to observe the duties in the morning, evening, and congregational service (Wazifah) and weekly congregational incantations (Zikr al-Juma'ah) after the Asr prayer to sunset.

2117,Tây Tạng Tự,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Tây Tạng Tự (“Tibetan Temple”) is located in the residential area of Thủ Dầu Một city in Bình Dương province. The temple was first built in 1928 and named Bửu Hương Tự (“Precious Fragrance Temple”). At the time, the temple practiced a school of Vietnamese Buddhism called Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương (“Way of the Strange Fragrance from the Precious Mountain”) that was founded in 1849. When Thích Minh Tịnh returned from his extended sojourn to Tibet, India and Nepal in 1937, he was offered the temple. Thích Minh Tịnh (1888-1951) was the first Vietnamese monk to travel to Tibet for a spiritual sojourn. There he studied Vajrayana with the fifth Reting Rinpoche, Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen. After 100 days, he was given the Tibetan dharma name Thubten Osall. He wrote a widely read journal entitled Sự tích Tây du Phật quốc (“Legend of a Journey to the West, Country of the Buddha”) that documented his pilgrimage to Tibet and South Asia, which has become a main source of inspiration for contemporary Vietnamese people to explore Vajrayana. In 1937, Thích Thích Minh Tịnh became the abbot of Bửu Hương Tự and renamed the temple Tây Tạng Tự to commemorate his trip to Tibet. In 1943, he was also offered Chùa Lâm Huê (Lâm Huê Temple) in Gia Định, but instead of accepting it he assigned his two students, Thích Tịch Chiếu and Thích Thường Chiếu, to receive it in his honor. Chùa Lâm Huê is now well known for its Mahayana-Vajrayana syncretistic aesthetics and practices that attract many Tibetan monks to host ritual events and followers from all over Vietnam. See the DRH entry on Chùa Lâm Huê to better understand Thích Minh Tịnh’s legacy of spreading Vajrayana throughout Vietnam. 
From 1992 to 1997, Tây Tạng Tự went through a major reconstruction and renovation that shaped its Tibetan-Mahayana syncretistic aesthetics and reputation. From 2008-2014, the temple added a seven-floor residency for nuns, dining halls, a communal kitchen and a garage. On top of the building is a 15-meter-high Vairocana Stupa that is home to the Five Tathagatas and four Bodhisattvas statues, all uniquely made in Tibetan style by a Vietnamese artisan. Importantly, the temple does not have any Vajrayana statues imported from South Asia, but rather has been commissioning a Vietnamese interior design company for the past decade. As far as we know, it is the first of currently two temples in Vietnam that has Tibetan-style statues made in Vietnam by Vietnamese artisans. In 2023, the temple constructed a new hall with more Vietnamese made Tibetan-style statues, as an extension to the seven-floor building connecting it with the Kṣitigarbha shrine room. 
Despite having ubiquitous Tibetan iconography and close connection with prominent Tibetan monks, such as Garchen Rinpoche and Chetsang Rinpoche, at present the temple only practices a Vietnamese school of Thiền Buddhism called Lâm Tế tông. Even when Tibetan monks visit the temple, they do not host Vajrayana ceremonies or empowerments. The temple has similar demographics as other Mahayana temples in Vietnam, in which the majority of followers are older women. Noticeably absent are young, cosmopolitan and business-minded followers, as is typical of other Vajrayana-Mahayana syncretistic temples in Vietnam. A senior monk at the temple shared that Vietnamese Vajrayana followers have visited Tây Tạng Tự and been disappointed with the lack of Vajrayana practice, some going as far as to brand it ‘fake’.

2118,Samaritan Hymn by Amram Dare,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The two texts referred to in this entry are attributed to the priest Amram Dare, the earliest poet of the Samaritan tradition (3rd century CE). However, the earliest manuscript witnesses to these texts date to the 16th and 18th centuries, respectively. These texts are two of the liturgical poems, or piyyutim, which, together with the later addition of prose prayers, compose the Samaritan prayer book, the Defter, which is written in Samaritan Aramaic. The Defter contains a total of 28 poems attributed to Amram Dare, which appear in the section labeled ""Hymns (or Liturgies) for the Sabbaths and Festivals."" This entry focuses on the hymns known as Amram Dare #6 and Amram Dare #25. The former is a short, lyrical, unrhymed hymn consisting of 33 stichs that emphasizes the uniqueness of God and Moses, while the latter is longer and more structured, consisting of 22 strophes with an embedded acrostic. The second hymn focuses on God's work as creator. Though the ritual occasion for their use in Late Antiquity is not precisely known, in contemporary Samaritan practice the first hymn is recited on Wednesday, the 4th Sabbath of the month, on festivals, and during the week of Shavuot. The second hymn is recited on the morning of the Sabbath and on festivals.",200,1800,2262,1539,Brandon Brown,2024-01-12 19:49:46.148 +0100,2024-02-27 21:28:29.340 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2119,Early populations of the Yucatan Peninsula,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The prehistoric site of Tulum
The cenotes and caves of Tulum, Quintana Roo, are repositories of an important archaeological and paleontological heritage that accounts for the history from the shallow seas that formed the calcareous substrate of the Yucatan Peninsula to the Pleistocene prairies, the animals that inhabited there and the first human groups of Asian origin.13,000 years ago this region was very different from what we know today: the sea level was 65 meters below the current level and the caves, in which we can dive today, were completely dry. The Tulum region was inhabited by nomadic or semi-nomadic groups who took advantage of the environment around the water sources inside the caves. These points formed veritable oases, surrounded by extensive grassland meadows. We know that these early groups showed respect for their dead because they deposited them inside caves as a form of veneration. Other individuals met their tragic end there when they got lost or suffered an accident.To date, 10 pre-Mayan or prehistoric human skeletons have been studied, which have been baptized as ""The Woman of Naharon"", ""The Lady of Las Palmas"", ""The Man of the Temple"", ""The Grandfather of Muknal"", ""The Man of Chan Hol 1"", ""The Young Man of Chan Hol 2"", ""The Man of Pit 1"", ""The Man of Pit 2"", ""Naia"" and ""Ixchel"".
Among all the individuals studied from the caves, La Mujer de Las Palmas stands out, since the evidence points to its placement corresponding to one of the oldest funerary treatments in Mexico. Its skeleton was found fully articulated in a flexed position, at the foot of a rock that we suppose was selected inside the cave. Its preservation is extraordinary, as even the smallest bones were found, such as the ossicles of the ear or throat, as well as the fingers and toes. Such a position denotes an intention in its placement and the use, most likely, of a bundle or funerary bundle, through the use of some skin that has decomposed, as well as tendons and ropes to preserve its body from scavengers that entered the caves, such as saber-toothed tigers. She was 1.52m tall, weighed 58kg and was between 44 and 50 years old at the time of her death. 
As for the skeletons or fossils of animals that have been found in the caves, they correspond to large species that also lived in jungles and forests, such as gomphotheres (pachyderms), giant sloths (megatherians), giant armadillos (glyptodonts), as well as bats and tapirs larger than today, and camels. The American horse, as small as ponies, also lived here, as well as other small animals such as peccaries and foxes. So far we know the location of more than 40 skeletons corresponding to 15 species of extinct mammals in 23 submerged caves. Most of them are still there. In the records made, anatomically articulated specimens can be distinguished that show that they died in the same place where they were found. There are also concentrations of bones that could be evidence of the consumption of fauna by humans, which has already been corroborated in the remains of a peccary.
The great richness of animal species extinct and prehistoric human groups at the end of the Pleistocene, allows us to consider the two largest underground rivers in the world: Ox Bel Ha and Sac Actun , as an important paleontological and prehistoric, site.",-13000,-8000,2192,1283,Carmen Rojas Sandoval,2024-01-12 21:36:56.606 +0100,2024-04-04 21:50:44.141 +0200,caves and cenotes.

2123,The Cacaxtla Gran Basamento,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Cacaxtla archaeological site, located in Tlaxcala, Mexico, stands as a compelling archaeological testament from the Epiclassic period (650-950 AD).

The Acropolis, also called Great Basement, is one of the three settlements that configures the Xochitecatl-Cacaxtla prehispanic city. While public monuments and temples were built 500 meters at the West of the Acropolis, commoner settlements were on the hills of present-day village of Nativitas. 

Of particular interest are the manifestation of elite occupations in the architectural layout and iconography of the site. The expansive palace-like structures, ceremonial courtyards, and elaborate murals collectively signify the presence of a ruling class exercising both political and religious authority. The mural compositions, depicting individuals adorned in regalia engaged in ceremonial and warfare activities, accentuate the elite nature of the Acropolis.

2127,Church of the Holy Apostles,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of the Holy Apostles was the second largest and most important church in Constantinople after Hagia Sophia, built as a combined church and funerary complex by Constantine in the Fourth Century and substantially rebuilt by Justinian in the 6th Century. It housed, alongside the remains of the apostles Andrew, Luke, and Timothy, numerous other relics, as well as the mortal remains of numerous emperors from Constantine to the last Macedonian empresses. The Justinianic iteration of the church was cruciform in plan (a seminal development for Byzantine ecclesiastical architecture), and surmounted by five domes, though the exact spatial relationship of the burial chamber known as the Apostoleion (apparently a rotunda comparable to that of Galerius in Thessalonike) to the rest of the building is not entirely clear, and several hypotheses have been put forward. Byzantine sources attest to the costliness and variety of materials used in its construction, including marble in myriad colors, roof-tiles of gilded bronze, mosaics, fretwork, and other such products of human artistry, and the ekphrases of Konstantinos Rhodios (10th Century) and Nicholas Mesarites (12th/13th Century) attest to an extensive decorative cycle of biblical scenes in mosaic on the interior of the Church. The complex was bounded and defined by a quadrangle of porticoes which provided access to subsidiary charitable, hygenic, and educational facilities (indeed, Mesarites records the existence of a prestigious school of the liberal arts attached to the Church). Moreover, as befitting such a grand edifice, it was also set in extensive parklands, gardens, and orchards, which would have represented an extensive and expansive green space in a city as populous as medieval Constantinople. Such splendor would begin to deteriorate after the Fourth Crusade, when the crusaders looted the building, broke into the tombs and stripped the imperial dead of their regalia. Following an interim of neglect under the Latin Empire, the church became the site of a commemorative statue of an angel dedicated by Michael VIII Palaiologos in thanksgiving for the recapture of the city in 1261. Nevertheless, his son Andronikos II Palaiologos was forced to undertake costly and largely unsuccessful repairs at the beginning of the 14th century, while the 15th century Florentine traveller Cristoforo Buondelmonti who visited Constantinople in the 1420s found the church in a state of advanced decay. Following the capture of the city by the Ottomans, it briefly became the headquarters of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, though soon thereafter the patriarch would decamp to the Church of the Theotokos Pammakaristos, and the complex would be demolish to make way for the Fatih Camii, which continues to occupy the site to this day. An image in the famous 12th century manuscript BnF Grec 1208, better known as the Homilies of James of Kokkinobaphos, is widely considered to depict a stylized image of the church, and buildings as diverse as St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, St. Anthony's Basilica in Padua, and Périgueux Cathedral are said to have been modeled on it.",330,1462,2222,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2024-01-21 22:42:37.590 +0100,2024-02-08 22:16:48.253 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2128,Paulicians,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Paulicians were a heterodox Christian group which emerged on the eastern frontiers of Byzantine Anatolia and in Armenia in the seventh century, apparently founded by a certain Armenian, Constantine of Samosata, who took the name Silvanus after one of the apostles of Paul, and who, according to legend, converted the official sent to try and execute him for heresy, with this man becoming his successor under the name of Titus, who would himself be executed by burning under Justinian II Rhinometos. Following the immolation  of their second leader, and fearing further persecution, the sect fled in a mass exodus to a certain region on the Eastern frontier known as Episparis, and thence to another adjacent region called Mananalis following the trial and acquittal of their leader Gegnaesius for heresy under the auspices of Leo I for fear of further interventions and potential persecution on the part of the Roman state; nevertheless, the emperor Constantine V effected the forced migration of numerous Paulicians to Thrace to strengthen the Thracian frontier, which would be the first of many forced and imperially mandated migrations from Anatolia to the Balkans. The death of Gegnaesius occasioned a  schism in the church between the party of Baanes and that of Sergius, with the Sergites gaining the ascendancy apparently proselytizing widely in the eastern provinces, and inviting renewed persecutions under Leo the Armenian. Under Theodora, a still more intense persecution began, which eventually led to the flight of many Paulicians under their leader Karbeas across the border into the districts of Armenia under Islamic rule, where the Emir of Melitene allowed them to construct the fortress city of Tephrike, which acted as a redoubt and buffer state with Byzantium under Arab protection. Nevertheless, in the late 9th century, Basil I conquered these principalities after prolonged wars with a particularly bellicose leader known as Chrysocheir, and while part of the population retreated further into Armenia, merging, evidently, into the emerging Tondrakian movement, much of the rest was deported to the Thracian provinces by he and his immediate successors, where they continued to exist as a distinct ethnoreligious group, renowned as hill raiders and warriors, and concentrated especially in the vicinity of Philippopolis, where they evidently evangelized the local population to their creed. They are believed to be the ancestors of modern day Banat Bulgarians who converted to Catholicism in the 16th and 17th Centuries, as well as of the Muslim Pomaks. It is also possible they had some influence on the Bogomiil sect and on that of the Cathars, though this may be a mistaken connection. The basic doctrines of the sect are very much a subject of debate, whether they were dualistic, gnostic, adoptionist, or simply a reformist movement unrelated to these designations. Their Christology seems to have been nontrinitarian, and according to the (admittedly biased) accounts of their belief attributed to the pen of to Petros Sikeliotes, they accepted the New Testament though not the Tanakh, and evidently had iconoclastic tendencies and worshipped in simple meetinghouses, though the account may represent a spurious source. Anna Komnene refers to them as Manichaeans in her Alexiad, but this seems to be more an imputation of potential dualism or perhaps a generic term of disparagement rather than any indication that they actually followed the doctrines of Mani. Based on their apparent rejection of imperial ecclesiastical and secular hierarchies, they are sometimes considered an egalitarian or proto-Marxist movement, or, conversely, a proto-protestant one, though such arguments are spurious at best.",650,1700,1893,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2024-01-21 23:00:15.816 +0100,2024-01-29 06:17:04.042 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2129,Saint Thecla (acts of Paul and Thecla) and baptism,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Thecla is a young woman who is engaged to a man named Thamyris and is about to get married. One day, while listening to Paul's preaching about the value and virtue of male and female virginity in a Christian context, Thecla was moved by his words. She was so inspired that she wanted to remain a virgin forever. When Thamyris discovers her intentions, he asks for Paul's persecution. Thecla followed Paul to prison and continued listening to his teachings. However, when she revealed her desire to remain a virgin in public, she was also persecuted, and the local authorities ordered her execution.  Thecla was not yet baptized; however, her soul was seeking baptism, and she asked Paul several times for it.
During the time of Antiquity, Christian baptism was a simple ritual that was performed on a daily basis. John's baptism was a clear example of this, as more and more Christians were baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  However, Thecla's experience suggests that this was not always the case. As a catechumen, she had to strive to achieve baptism on her own, which was a difficult and challenging process. While it is unclear why she was not baptized, her journey as a catechumen provides valuable insights into the early Christian church's beliefs and practices. Thecla eventually was baptized on her own before her last conviction. This act reveals many myths about the act and ritual of baptism. As far as we know, the ritual of baptism was performed by a priest or the Baptist in Late Antiquity;  Thecla comes to erase this thought and fact and tells us that baptism is a personal ritual that anyone with true faith inside them can perform. Of course, what Thecla did was not a popular option but rather an emergency one. Emergency baptism was not that popular in the first century since the establishment of Christianity was not that stable yet. Still, it certainly existed and was performed by the laic.",1,2,1495,1337,Zoe Tsiami,2024-01-22 11:19:32.442 +0100,2024-01-22 11:20:31.697 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2131,Chimú Empire Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Chimú empire developed on the North Coast of Peru between ca. 900 and 1470 CE and its peak it was one of the largest Prehispanic polities in the Americas. The 1604 Anonymous History of Trujillo includes a mythical account of Chimú origins (Rowe 1948). A foreign noble called Taycanamo arrived in the Moche Valley, disembarking from a balsa log raft, claiming to be sent by a great lord from across the sea. He spent a year to learn local customs and traditions. He was given local women for wives and became Chimu' ruler (Chimor Capac), establishing a dynasty. Chan Chan, the capital of the empire, was located in the Moche Valley and it was the largest urban center of its time, covering about 20km2 (urban core 6 km2) and hosting 30,000-40,000 people. In an alternative origin myth recorded by Percy Valladares Huamanchumo (2021), the city may have been founded by a man who was born from an egg laid by the Moon in the Guañape islands. The man was raised by people living in the fishing village of Huanchaco. Eventually, he became their leader and funded Chan Chan. Chan Chan featured a variety of buildings made with sunbaked adobe bricks or tapia (rammed earth) walls, including walled royal compounds (ciudadelas), elite compounds, ceremonial platforms (huacas), and residential areas for commoners/artisans. As shown by these architectural compounds and by creation myths, people were subdivided into well-defined, and perhaps immutable, social classes. A myth mentioned by Antonio de la Calancha says that coastal people were created by four stars: two stars created kings and nobles, while the other two stars created commoners. Another myth recorded by the same author described the creation of social classes from three eggs. Royal and noble males spawned from a golden egg, noble women from a silver egg, and commoners from a copper egg (Calancha 1638; Mackey and Moore 2008; Moseley and Cordy-Collins 1990: Rowe 1948). 

By 1200 CE, the Chimú empire consolidated its power in its heartland, which was composed of the Moche, Chicama, and Virú valleys. The 14th century was marked by a significant expansion of the empire: in that century, the Chimú expanded northward, conquering the lands controlled by the Lambayeque/Sicán polity (the area comprised between the Lambayeque and the Chira valleys), and southward, defeating the Casma polity and occupying its territory (between Chao and Casma valleys). The empire may have also exerted its influence further north to Tumbes and south to the Chillón valley through trade. At its peak, the Chimú empire featured a four-tiered settlement hierarchy, with the capital Chan Chan at the top, followed by the regional centers of Farfán, Túcume, and Manchan, and tertiary and quaternary centers scattered throughout the empire. The Chimú dominance over the North Coast of Peru came to an end around 1470 CE, when the Inka defeated them and incorporated this part of the Central Andes into their empire. 

Excavations carried out at Chimú settlements and ethnohistorical sources help us shed light on the religious practices of the people that occupied the North Coast of Peru during the Late Intermediate Period (ca. 900/1000-1470 CE).",900,1470,2199,1198,Amedeo Sghinolfi,2024-01-23 15:24:25.814 +0100,2024-03-25 18:12:51.373 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2134,"The Paredros of Pnouthis, the Sacred Scribe (PGM I, 42-195)",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This ritual instruction describes how to gain a divine entity as a serving assistant (paredros). It is preserved in the ancient Greek magical papyrus ""PGM I"" (P. 5025 A + B) which was found in Egypt, the exact findspot is unknown. The papyrus has recently been re-dated from the late 4th or early 5th century to the second half of the 3rd century.
The text states that this ritual was transmitted by an Egyptian priest in the rank of a sacred scribe called Pnouthis who handed it down in a letter addressed to ""Keryx"". ""Keryx"" means ""herald"" and it is debated if this referred to a real person or to an ideal person since ""Keryx"" was also the ancestor of the sacred heralds at Eleusis. In his letter Pnouthis explains that he has researched countless books with paredros-rituals and ""removed all of the prescriptions"" to offer Keryx a single, simple ritual with tremendous powers.
What is paredros-magic? In opposite to the common rituals in ancient magic, which predominantly fulfilled a single purpose and the ritual's power coming into effect immediately, paredros-magic aims to bind a higher power to the practitioner for a period of time defined by the practitioner, to fulfil various purposes whenever and wherever the practitioner wishes to. Paredros-magic reminds of a genie in a bottle and in this ritual instruction the invoked paredros is referred to not only as an angel and a god but specifically as a god who is an aerial spirit (ὁ θεός πνεῦμά ἐστιν ἀέριον).
The paredros of this ritual is the most powerful one attested in the Greek magical papyri. The ritual description includes a detailed, lengthy list of his individual powers, among them sending dreams, bringing in women and men without the use of sympathetic materials, killing and destroying, stirring up winds from the earth, and providing the practitioner with gold, silver, and bronze, whenever the need arises, opening doors, causing invisibility, releasing from bonds, changing into whatever form the practitioner wants, and offering divinations. Uniquely preserved is the addressing of the treatment of the practitioner by the paredros following the practitioner's death. It is explicitly stated that his body will be wrapped up as befits a god and that his spirit will be carried into the air with him and not go into Hades.
This paredros is bound to stay with the practitioner through all the time of his life and the text mentions that he will live in a room in the house of the practitioner.
The ritual itself is not very complicated but it includes the engraving of a stone which was delivered by a falcon. This delivery is described as a divine sign (σημεῖον). Material objects as divine signs are very unusual in the Greek magical papyri. The appearance of the paredros himself is also referred to as a sign (σημεῖον) and described as a star which will descend from heaven, coming to a stop in front of the practitioner before dissolving into an angel.
The ritual is referred to as the ""sacred rite"" and addresses especially the sun god Helios and the moon goddess Selene.",250,425,1287,1392,Kirsten Dzwiza,2024-01-24 16:04:11.428 +0100,2024-01-24 19:42:12.467 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2136,Panagia tou Araka,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Panagia tou Araka is a Byzantine church of indeterminate date in the vicinity of the village of Lagoudera on the flanks of Madari in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, which may have been the katholikon of a monastery or else a private chapel. It consists of a hall terminating in an apse and with a central dome, with the exterior largely concealed behind a more modern system of wood roofing and trellising characteristic of the region, and is  possessed of an unusually masterful and complete cycle of religious frescos dating to the year 1192. These were commissioned by a certain Leontios Authentes (perhaps a local notable), and painted by a certain Theodoros Apsevdis, an artist assumed by scholars to have come from Constantinople based on stylistic analysis. The frescos depict a variety of holy personages and biblical scenes, most famously an impressive and yet profoundly humanizing image of the Pantokrator on the interior of the dome, a painting of the Theotokos standing before her heavenly throne, seeming to offer up the infant Jesus to his eventual fate while flanked by angels bearing the instruments of the passion (associated by certain scholars with the an atmosphere of fatalism provoked by the tumultuous history of Cyprus under Isaakios Komnenos and later under crusader occupation), and a scene of the infant Christ being cradled by Saint Simeon while John the Baptist gestures towards them holding a scroll. All the paintings, executed with a mixture of costly materials including ultramarine, vermilion, and gold and silver leaf, exhibit a style characterized by dynamic movement, the use of sinuous line and brilliant color, and by an elegant attenuation of the figures reminiscent of contemporary fresco programs in North Macedonia such as at the Church of Saint Panteleimon at Gorno Nerezi or the Church of Saint George at Kurbinovo. Like the mural cycles at the aforementioned churches in the Thracian provinces, the frescos at Panagia tou Araka display the increasing humanism of Komnenian and Angelid art, with a certain focus on physical naturalism and profound emotion, as well as the inclusion of quotidian features of dress and landscape (such as the buildings in the background of the scene of the Presentation of the Virgin or the dress of the herdsmen in the scene of the Nativity) , which may reflect the material realities of Twelfth Century Byzantium. Certain parts of the decorative cycle were restored following damage in the 14th century by a certain Deacon Leontios, while, in the 20th century, large scale cleaning, restoration, and analysis was conducted under the auspices of  the Dumbarton Oaks Research Center and Collection.

2138,الجماعة الأحمدية الإسلامية في نيجيريا,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ahmadiyya Movement was founded in British India by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1836-1906), an Islamic reformist and mystic, who in 1891 claimed that he was a prophet, mujaddid (“renewer”), and the messiah/mahdi anticipated by Muslims. The Movement was introduced in Lagos in 1916 and became popular among young intellectuals. Consequently it split in the 1930s over the issue of foreign control. A Nigerian branch of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam took shape under the leadership of Alhaji Jibril Martin, a leader of the Nigerian Youth Movement. By the 1950s there were three separate sections of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Lagos. Martin was also a cofounder and chairman of the Pilgrims’ Board of Nigeria’s western region, which administered the hajj pilgrimage following independence.
The Ahmadiyya Movement began establishing centers in the north in the 1960s, which was resisted among local Muslim leaders, including Abubakar Gumi, an Islamic legal scholar and future leader of the Islamist Yan Izala movement. Gumi translated several anti-Ahmadiyya works, including those by Pakistani Islamist Abul A'la al-Mawdudi, and supported the decision of the Islamic World League condemning the Ahmadiyya as heretical. In 1973, Saudi Arabia forbade Ahmadi Muslims from acquiring hajj visas, leading to violent protests in Nigeria during which Ahmadis occupied the Saudi embassy in Lagos. In 1974, the Nigerian Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs and the Jama’atu Nasril Islam adopted the League’s resolution, requiring that Muslims seeking a hajj visa acquire a written certificate from a local imam affirming that he or she was not a member of the Ahmadiyya Movement. As a result, the Ahmadiyya Movement split again, one dissenting group adopting the named Anwar al-Islam (“Rays of Islam”) and aligning itself with mainstream Sunni Islam. 

Nayyar's stay in Lagos coincided with the establishment of additional branches in Ebutte-Meta and Epe. Movement activities commenced in Yaba in 1921, and within two years, members had established missions in Ibadan, Kano and Zaria.[6] Expansion into Ado-Odo, Otta, Ijede and Ondo was completed by the mid 1930s .",1916,2024,1082,1304,Jabir  Musa,2024-01-25 11:41:38.267 +0100,2024-01-25 11:41:38.267 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2140,"St. John Chrysostom, Homilies On the Incomprehensible Nature of God",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"An important place among John's discourses are the five sermons on God's incomprehensibility. They form a unity, which the editors have incorporated into a series of discourses which Chrysostom delivered against the Anomeans. The Anomoeans was a religious group that represented an extreme form of Arianism. Arius and his followers believed that the essential difference between God and Christ was that God had always existed, while Christ was created by God. The Anomeans distorted the Nicene Creed formulation that the “Son of God, the only begotten of the Father” meant that the Father is believed to be unbegotten and the Son being begotten made God. Therefore, the Father and the Son are unalike (ανόμοιοι). The founder of the Anomoeans, Aëtius of Antioch, held that God and Christ could not be alike. Since ingenerateness is a crucial part of the essence of God, Christ could not be like God because he lacked this essential quality. Another principal belief of the Anomeans was the ingenerateness (ἀγεννησία) of God the Father. Being ingenerated, the Father could never come into contact or communicate His nature to generated beings. Therefore, the Son is generated (γεννητός), created by the power of the Ingenerated Father. The homilies Against the Anomoeans (twelve in number) fall into two series both in theme as well as in time and place. The setting was unique: not only were the Anomoeans present among his flock to listen to John, but they had even challenged him. This was a fine opportunity both to refute the errors of the Anomeans and to instruct his creed in the tenets of the true faith. Chrysostom, hence, could work for the conversion of the Anomoeans, and, at the same time, he could protect his own flock. The first five sermons were delivered in Antioch, in the autumn of 386, that is, the year in which Chrysostom had been ordained as a presbyter. The first sermon was delivered presumably at the end of August, while the rest during November and December of the same year. Although the theme of the sermons is strictly doctrinal, there is a number of moral exhortations, so dear to Chrysostom. For this reason, John also introduces the issue of prayer in these five sermons, particularly towards the end of each speech. In these five sermons Chrysostom mainly deals with a key point of the Anomean teaching, as posited by Eunomius: the epistemological problem. Following Aristotle, the Eunomius and his followers admitted that the human intellectual capacity is unlimited and able to conceive both the nature of the world and the actions of God. Thus, what God knows about himself, can be also known by humans. The Orthodox theologians, hence, diagnosed two tendencies in the Anomean teaching, which give rise to two problems: 
1) the tendency to declare man epistemologically self-sufficient, since he is able to grasp with his intellect everything, therefore he does not need God;
2) the tendency to diminish the greatness of God, since they persist in the abusive attempt to make God an object of curiosity and intellectual inquiry, as an object accessible to the human intellect. 
So, according to Chrysostom, God is transcendent and inconceivable. As the sole principle, cause and source of all beings and all goods, God acts through and with his Word (Logos). It is therefore impossible for human beings to conceive the inconceivable God. Being finite with limited intellectual capabilities and moving within the epistemological limits that God has provided to, human beings cannot reach the full understanding of the divine mystery. However, Chrysostom does not promote agnosticism. On the contrary, God gave man the possibility of partial knowledge. This is a natural result of His goodness, that is, that he descends into the world and allows himself to be known. God reveals Himself, but what He reveals is not His essence, but His divine energies. For this reason, the human intellect can never comprehend God’s essence, but only His will and His energies. Such revelation comes through faith. It does not need logical constructions, only auxiliary, interpretive ones. Regarding the following seven sermons, the 6th sermon is a break in the sequence of Chrysostom's attack against the Anomoeans. John has proved that God's nature is incomprehensible to every creature and has introduced the second part of his argument, the ""glory of the only begotten,"" the con substantiality of the Son with the Father. Therefore, the theme in sermons 7-12 that the Son is one in substance with the Father. So, in the remaining sermons Chrysostom sets to complete his discussion of the Son's co-substantiality. Hence, sermons 7 and 8 have the same theme with sermons 9 and 10, since they all stress the glory of the only begotten and His equality in power with the Father. So the twelve homilies against the Anomoeans treat of two themes, the incomprehensibility of God (sermons 1-5) and the consubstantiality of Christ with the Father (sermons 7-12); they fall into two series separated by time and place: sermons 1-5 were delivered at Antioch in the years 386-87; sermons 11 and 12 belong to 398 and were preached in Constantinople.",347,407,2205,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2024-01-27 10:22:07.957 +0100,2024-02-02 09:39:28.281 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2142,Noravank (Նորավանք),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Noravank is a medieval monastic and royal funerary complex located in the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia near the town of Yeghegnadzor above the Amaghu gorge. The site is comprised of several medieval ecclesiastical and smaller civil buildings. The walls surrounded the primary site were an 18th century addition. Noravank is still a functioning ecclesiastical site offering religious services to the local community, as well as a major tourist destination for the region. Today the site also houses a small museum complex, showcasing archaeological finds from the site and several interpretive panels. The most notable structures at Noravank are its two standing churches: Surb Karapet and Surb Astvatsatsin. 

Surb Karapet (Church of the Holy Precurser, Saint John the Baptist) was built in 1216-1227 as a comission by Prince Liparit Orbelian, after an earlier church with the same dedication was destroyed in an earthquake. The ruins of the original Surb Karapet can be found just south of the present church. The church features a domed cross-in-square floorplan. The cupola and roof have been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times due to regional seismic events. The addition of a large Gavit (narthex) was constructed in 1261, commissioned by Smbat Orbelian for whom the Gavit also serves as a burial vault. The Gavit features a number of elaborately carved khachkars, and the tympanum depicts the Virgin and Child seated on a rug adorned with floral, vegetal and geometric patterns – including stylized pomegranates, and the Holy Mother and Child are flanked by Isaiah and John the Baptist. Other scenes within the Gavit include a Crucifixion scene and the Ancient of Days. Adjoining the church is a rectangular side chapel with vaulted ceilings and circular apse dedicated to Saint Grigor (The Illuminator). The chapel was built by the architect Siranes in 1275, and also serves a funerary function - housing the resting places of a number of Orbelian family members. 

Surb Astvatsatsin (Church of the Holy Mother of God), completed construction in 1339 and served as the Syunik royal funerary church for Prince Burtegh Orbelian and several members of his family. The building itself was designed and sculpted by the Armenian Cilician architect and artist Momik, who died prior to the buildings completion in 1333 and he is entombed near the entrance of the church. It is among the most recognizable Armenian churches today for its unique two-story design and narrow cantilevered exterior double staircase along its west façade. The lower funerary vault features a rectangular plan, atop which sits a cross-in-square oratory with a colonnaded central dome. Relief carvings adorn both the church’s façade and dome. The lower tympanum features the Virgin and Child enthroned, flanked by Gabriel and Michael and the upper tympanum features Christ flanked by Apostles Peter and Paul. An array of floral, vegetal, geometric, and figural reliefs adorns the buildings facades. Noteworthy are the images of crowned sirens and doves.

2143,City of God,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"City of God is one of the last works written by Augustine of Hippo (554-430 CE), a Christian bishop, philosopher, theologian, and Church Father from Hippo Regius in Roman North Africa. Many of the ideas put forth in this work remain essential Church doctrines. These include the doctrine of original sin, the conflict between divine omniscience and free will, and explanations for the existence of evil. 
Augustine wrote City of God as a response to those non-Christian Romans who argued that the sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 CE and the general decline of Rome was the fault of Christians. Roman religion required sacrifices to various gods in order to gain their favor and protection resulting in good conditions for the Roman Empire. Many thus argued that Christianity's adoption by Rome since the reign of Constantine (272-337 CE) had caused neglect of duties to Roman gods, resulting in Rome's deterioration.
Augustine first asserted that it was Christianity that was responsible for Rome's earlier successes. Furthermore, he argued that Rome's decline was ultimately unimportant compared with the goal of heaven, which he called the City of God (distinguished from Rome as the CIty of Human Beings). 
City of God examines human history as the conflict between these two cities which is the conflict between God and Satan, arguing that God is bound to win because history is and has always been divinely guided.",410,426,2299,1128,Joshua Schachterle,2024-01-28 18:48:46.842 +0100,2024-03-07 09:55:10.232 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Given the church’s proximity to the ruined estate of Lord Tarsaitch Orbelian, and Momik’s association with the Orbelian family, it is likely that this church was a commission of the Orbelian nobility. Located on at an elevation above the village and Arpa River, the church is made of ashlar quarried from the local stone upon which it sits and features a single nave with two aisles and a semi-circular eastern apse. The roof features a classical Armenian-style conical dome with pronounced drum and cupola with relief carvings on each of the four primary pendentives depicting the tetramorph: a winged lion, winged ox, winged man, and winged eagle representing the four Evangelists. Entrances can be found on both the southern and western façades of the church. The southern exterior tympanum features a simple stylised cross carving, while the western façade features a tympanum relief of the Virgin Mary and Child enthroned and is surrounded by inscription. Outside of the church are several kachkars, burial markers, and sarcophagi, many which feature elaborately carved scenes. The church is still in use as a primary place of worship for Areni villagers.",1321,2024,2208,1554,Aurora Camaño,2024-01-29 11:23:48.770 +0100,2024-01-31 18:14:11.592 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2149,Judaism in Byzantium,43,Religious Group (v6),"Jews constituted a significant minority group with the Byzantine Empire for the entirety of its history, and were, to a degree, integrated into wider Roman society, yet occupying something of a liminal position. Their legal status was defined and circumscribed in Late Antiquity by successive legislations, with them being guaranteed a degree of protection from arbitrary molestation and right to practice their religion freely, while also being legally and socially subordinated to the Christian majority. For example, the Theodosian code barred their participation in civil or military officialdom, while the Justinianic code attempted to subordinate the administration of the Jewish community to that of the Roman State, further circumscribing the rights of Jews and, most strikingly, banning the public reading of the Pentateuch in Hebrew rather than Greek, and totally proscribing the reading of the Mishna. Herakleios, faced with a combination of internal crisis and Jewish support of Sassanian and later Arab occupations of Syria and Egypt, attempted a massive forced conversion of Jews and heretics within the empire, though this was apparently unsuccessful, as the continued existence of vigorous Jewish communities within Byzantium attest, and the years between the reign of Herakleios and the Fourth Crusade would be punctuated by only brief and limited persecutions under Leo III the Isaurian, Basil I the Macedonian, and Ioannes Tzimiskes. Despite their potentially precarious social and legal position, the Jewish communities of Byzantium flourished; Justinian's prohibition on the reading of the Mishna conversely led to the composition of elaborate liturgical poems known as piyutim, which were influential in later traditions of the Mahzor, while scholars in a Jewish Community in the Byzantine Catepanate of Italy composed the famous chronicle of the Sefer Yosippon. Benjamin of Tudela's notes on his travels through Byzantium in the twelfth century during the reign of Manuel I Komnenos reveal a world in which, despite both institutionalized and informal systems of antisemitic segregation and discrimination, Jewish communities flourished economically, taking part in agriculture, medicine, trade, and the especially the production of luxury textiles. Though partially segregated from broader society by the boundaries of their designated quarters and internal communal institutions, Jewish communities were a conspicuous presence in the larger cities of the Byzantine world such as Thebes, Corinth, Thessalonike, Rhodes, and above all in Pera-Galata opposite Constantinople, which, before it became a Genoese colony, was an extramural settlement of Jews and tanners. The depredations visited upon the Empire by Latin Crusaders and seaborne marauders that would culminate in the Fourth Crusade effected Byzantine Jews as it did their Christian neighbors (or, indeed, perhaps more so), and the impoverished successor states which emerged from those crises proved more able and more willing to persecute Jews than their predecessors, as bouts of persecution in the Despotate of Epiros under Theodore Komnenos Doukas, and in the Empire of Nikaia under Ioannes Vatatzes and his son Theodoros II Laskaris demonstrate. Nevertheless, the ascension of the Palaiologoi at least temporarily reversed this pattern, for Michael VIII relied on the funds of the Jewish community in his bid for emperor and, as such, extended to them certain freedoms and protections which were preserved by his son and successor Andronikos II, attracting censure from the Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria. Ultimately, the Jewish communities which proved the sites of the most anxiety for the Palaiologoi would be those of Venetian Jews or Jews of naturalized Venetian citizenship, who thus came under the purview of the economic and legal concessions granted to La Serenissima. The conquest of Byzantium by the Ottomans, however, incorporated Byzantine, or Romaniote, Jews into a far broader patchwork of communities in Europe and the Middle East, and led to the settlement in the Aegean of numerous Sephardic refugees fleeing from the kingdoms of Iberia, which would alter the Jewish demography of the region. Nevertheless, Romaniote congregations continue to exist in Greece, Israel, and the United States to this day.",330,1453,1893,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2024-01-29 16:09:16.212 +0100,2024-02-22 19:00:42.575 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2152,Wang Bi's 王弼 commentary to the Daodejing 道德經: the Laozi Daodejing zhu 老子道德經注,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Wang Bi 王弼 edition and commentaries to the Daodejing 道德經 represent, together with the Heshang Gong 河上公 edition, the most circulated editions of the text. 
Wang Bi, styled as Fusi 輔嗣, was born in Luoyang in 226 AD and died at the age of 23 in 249 AD, because of an epidemic. A promising philosopher already since a very young age, during the Three Kingdoms period (San guo 三國, 220 – 280 AD), he served as a bureaucrat in the state of Cao Wei 曹魏.
Identified by scholarship as either Xuanxue 玄學 (with Lao-Zhuang 老莊 and Huang-Lao 黃老 influences) or primarily Confucian, he is mostly known for his commentaries on the Lunyu 論語 (of which we only have transmitted quotations), on the Yijing 易經, and on the Daodejing: the Laozi Daodejing zhu 老子道德經注 (Commentary to the Laozi) and the Laozi Zhilüe 老子指略 (Introduction to the Laozi).
Wang Bi's edition of the Laozi 老子, which accompanies his commentary, is widely regarded as the standard edition of the text, despite showing some later interpolations. Nevertheless, his recension of the Laozi and the attached commentary have been translated into several languages, as well as having influenced the philosophical debate in China for nearly two millennia. 
The earliest transmitted copies of Wang Bi’s edition of the Laozi with his commentary that have come down to us are dated to the Ming Dynasty 明朝 (1368–1644) and some discrepancies are noticeable between the Laozi edition attached to the commentary and the quotations given in the commentary itself. There is a total of 79 passages in which Wang Bi’s commentary differs from Wang Bi’s Laozi. In 78 of these occurrences, the reading in the commentary matches the reading found in Guodian 郭店, Mawangdui 馬王堆, and other manuscript-editions of the Laozi or in quotations from the Laozi in various earlier texts (e.g., in the Huainanzi 淮南子 or the Zhanguo ce 戰國策). It is plausible that the verses quoted in the commentary represent the Laozi known to Wang Bi, while the Laozi edition attached to Wang Bi’s commentary might have suffered more than the commentary from later interpolations and changes (especially elements taken from Heshang Gong’s text). The differences between quotations from Wang Bi’s commentary in other texts and the transmitted version of his commentary are small, implying that it must be close to the original written by Wang Bi.
Wang Bi refers to a Laozi text divided into zhang 章 and pian 篇, but without ever mentioning a division into a Dejing section and a Daojing section. In the Laozi Zhilüe, Wang Bi always refers to the Laozi, while he never calls the text “Daodejing.”
His philosophical analysis of the Daodejing is based on the centrality of the notion of wu 無 (non-being, nothingness) as the point of origin for the generation of the ten thousand things (wanwu 萬物). Wu, according to Wang Bi, corresponds to the Dao 道 (Way), and this concept is echoed by various metaphors in the body of the text (for example, the hub of a wheel, the valley, the door). Wang Bi also identifies wu with the function of the Dao and of Ziran 自然 (naturalness) meaning that the Dao acts out of nothing, and never acts out of something – it acts with no consciousness. And the sage does the same: he embodies wuwei 無為, not in the sense of “non-action,” but rather in the sense of “non-deliberate action.” Acting against the principle of wuwei, that is, against the Dao, inevitably brings danger. The sage, albeit being a human being and being involved in human affairs, according to Wang Bi, always acts naturally and responds to things spontaneously and with no personal desires. Wang Bi identifies Confucius with the Laozian sage, capable of wuwei, embodying the principle of nothingness. Wang reads the Laozi asserting that you 有 (being) comes from wu, and that wu is the ultimate substance of being, conferring enormous centrality to emptiness (xu 虛) and to the idea of emptying one’s heart-mind in order to respond to things in their ziran. Because of this peculiar understanding of the concept of emptiness in the Laozi, Wang Bi’s commentary played a crucial role in the popularization of Mahayana Buddhist doctrines in China.
Wang Bi’s provides comments on the various zhang trying to reduce ambivalence in more obscure passages through references to passages of clearer content; he explains the words, clarifies the metaphors, and provides grammatical explications where needed.
Wang Bi’s Laozi has been transmitted divided into 81 zhang of which two (zhang 31 and zhang 66) are not provided with a commentary. For the remaining 79 zhang, 403 commentary statements are provided in total. It is plausible that the entire comment for each zhang was originally written at the end of the zhang, justifying the presence of repeated verses from the Laozi in the commentary, preceded by 故曰/故/故云/故謂.",200,2023,809,1195,Francesca Puglia,2024-01-30 17:50:35.595 +0100,2024-01-31 00:06:55.400 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2153,Guishen zhi ming 鬼神之明,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Guishen zhi ming 鬼神之明 (The Brilliant Insight of Ghosts and Spirits) is the title given to a bamboo manuscript included in the Shanghai Museum collection. It is a looted bamboo manuscript acquired by the Shanghai Museum from the Hong Kong Antiquities Market in 1994. The manuscript has been dated by archaeologists around 300 BCE and it is deemed to be an original product from the southern state of Chu 楚. Ding Sixin 丁四新 proposed the alternative title Guishen 鬼神 (Ghosts and Spirits) for this manuscript, based on the tradition of juxtaposing two main words from the first sentence.
It is a short text inked on five bamboo strips (the fifth being shared with the Rongshi you chengshi 融師有成氏) that includes a total of 197 characters (211 when counting the recovered ones, according to Cao Jinyan 曹锦炎). The transcription of the text is found in Ma Chengyuan 马承源, Shanghai Bowuguan Zhanguo Chu zhushu 上海博物館戰國楚竹書 vol. 5.
Similarly to the Mozi 墨子 (with particular reference to the Ming Gui 明鬼 III section, since sections I and II are now lost), the Guishen zhi ming argues for the existence of ghosts and spirits, strengthening the prominence of this theme within the Warring States (475–221 BCE) religious and philosophical discourse.
But contrary to the Mozi and to Confucian view, this text states that in some realms ghosts and spirits are indeed perspicuous, while in others they are not. Just as in the Mozi, however, ghosts and spirits cover the role of rewarders and punishers of humans, based on people’s behavior – although, according to the author of this manuscript, ghosts and spirits are not omniscient. The existence of ghosts and spirits is not questioned; what the author is skeptical about is the ability of these beings to recognize people's individual instances of merit and guilt so that they can be rewarded or punished accordingly. This limiting view of the abilities of ghosts and spirits, absent from the debate that emerges from the transmitted tradition, offered additional nuance to the religious discussion of the Warring States period.
The manuscript, in line with Mozi's view and sharing the same vocabulary, refers to instances in which indeed ghosts and spirits reward the good and punish the wicked (賞善罰暴), bringing the example of the virtuous sovereigns of antiquity Yao 堯, Shun 舜, Yu 禹, and Tang 湯 and of the tyrants Jie 桀, Zhou 紂, You 幽, and Li 厲. But the manuscript also brings contrary examples: those cases in which a wise ruler is not rewarded (the case of Wu Zixu 伍子胥) or a wicked one is not punished (Duke Yi of Rong 榮夷公). By using huo 或 (sometimes) the manuscript clarifies the underlying idea that justice at the hands of ghosts and spirits is not inevitable, but rather sporadic: 如以此詰之 ， 則善者或不賞 ， 而暴者或不罰.
The text also proposes possible reasons behind this lack of ming 明 (brilliant insight, perspicuity) on the side of the ghosts and spirits, posing two possible scenarios, but avoiding making a choice among the two: one possibility is that ghosts and spirits actually have the strength and the capacity (neng li 能力) to always be perspicuous, yet they choose to not do so; the second possibility is that they wish to possess a firmer strength (li 力), but they do not.",-400,-300,1775,1195,Francesca Puglia,2024-01-31 00:36:14.871 +0100,2024-01-31 22:16:11.710 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2154,Chichen Itza,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Chichen Itza, located in the Yucatan Peninsula, is a prominent archaeological site that holds great significance in the realm of Mesoamerican studies and the exploration of ancient Maya pre-Hispanic cultures. 
This ancient city, whose name translates to ""At the mouth of the well of the Itza,"" is a testament to the architectural and cultural prowess of the Maya civilization. Its rich historical and cultural significance has been the subject of extensive scholarly study, with numerous texts and sources contributing to our understanding of this remarkable site.

Chichen Itza thrived during the Terminal Classic (Yabnal Phase) and Early Postclassic (Chichen Itza Phase) periods, roughly spanning from the 7th to the 13th century CE. This chronological context places it within a pivotal era of transition and transformation in Maya society, marked by the decline of the southern lowland cities and the emergence of new centers of power in the northern Yucatan.

Situated in the northern reaches of the Yucatan Peninsula, Chichen Itza's location played a crucial role in its historical development. The site's proximity to natural water sources and its strategic positioning within the region's trade networks contributed to its prominence as a political and economic hub, influencing the city's growth and cultural interactions with neighboring regions.

Chichen Itza's cultural significance extends beyond its architectural grandeur. The site's structures, such as the iconic Pyramid of Kukulcan (El Castillo), the Temple of the Warriors, and the Great Ball Court, or recently excavated Temple of the Turtles in the Initial Serie reflect the Maya's advanced understanding of astronomy, mathematics, and religious practices. Additionally, the integration of diverse architectural styles, believed to be influenced by the Central Mexico people, highlights Chichen Itza's role as a melting pot of Mesoamerican cultures.

Chichen Itza's exploration has significantly contributed to the broader field of Mesoamerican studies, shedding light on the interregional connections, sociopolitical dynamics, and religious practices of ancient Maya civilization. As a UNESCO World Heritage site, its preservation and ongoing research serve as a focal point for interdisciplinary studies, encompassing archaeology, anthropology, art history, and epigraphy.",650,1150,2220,1201,Bertrand Lobjois,2024-01-31 05:58:55.000 +0100,2024-02-28 07:16:48.321 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2157,Blue Light Evangelicals in the Late Eighteenth-Century Royal Navy,43,Religious Group (v6),"Rear Admiral Richard Kempenfelt and Comptroller of the Navy Charles Middleton are credited for spearheading the Blue Light Movement within the Royal Navy. This was a Methodist campaign that sought to restore ritualized religious adherence among sailors aboard ship throughout the American, French, and Napoleonic Wars. This aquatic sub-revival is closely affiliated with the Navy, but merchantmen also witnessed this movement below deck. Navy officers with Methodist leanings were principally referred to as ""Blue Lights,"" and while these men were characteristically socially and politically conservative, they believed that the spiritual status-quo of the Royal Navy prior to the American Revolutionary War necessitated reform. The Blue Lights believed that the Navy was tainted by licentiousness, lethargy and moral decline due to a lack of competent religious leadership throughout the eighteenth-century and needed a spiritual reawakening. For these staunch Protestants, a primary aim for introducing evangelical Christianity into British maritime life was to group officers and common seamen together in a religious unity that transcended rank. Blue Lights perceived the ship as a fertile missional ground for evangelistic activity and paternal pastorship among the rank and file. As one ""church,"" officers and sailors gathered below deck in the crew's quarters to read the Bible, sing psalms, and pray in equitable brotherhood; a revolutionary idea in a traditional environment that structurally reinforced rank segregation. As a term, it is difficult to ascertain when ""Blue Light"" was first used. However, the nickname caught on by the end of the Napoleonic Wars in naval circles, with common sailors being referred to as Methodists or pslam-singers and officers as Blue Lights (sometimes also called psalm-singers).",1775,1815,2225,1560,Bethany Henderson,2024-02-01 21:46:32.113 +0100,2024-03-25 19:11:27.849 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2158,The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The so-called mausoleum of Galla Placidia was initially an annex chapel of a cross-shaped basilica with aisleless arms, which is known under the name of S. Croce (the Holy Cross). This church was founded between 425 and 450, by Galla Placidia, the daughter of emperor Theodosius I (Theodosius the Great). Nowadays, only the ruins of the S. Croce basilica are preserved. The annex chapel was an oratory dedicated to S. Lorenzo Fomoso. However, it seems that it was intended to host the tomb of Galla Placidia. This never happened because the empress died in Rome and she was buried there. 
The mausoleum of Galla Placidia is a small building in the shape of a Latin cross with barrel-vaulted arms and a high central bay that supports a pendentive dome. The windows are framed by blind arcades; classical cornices set off the pediments over the arms. The masonry is composed of very high bricks and narrow beds of white mortar. The interior decoration is elaborate and related to the art of the Imperial court. The walls are coated with grey marble down to the floor level. 
The iconographic program of the monument is simple, composed mainly of various decorative elements and not so many figures. The hemispherical dome and the four pendentives are decorated with the starry dark blue sky and a golden Latin cross in the middle. The longer arm of the cross is turned towards the east. On the four sides, in the sprandles, the four symbols of the Evangelists (the Lion, the Eagle, the Angel and the Ox) appear through clouds. Right below, in the four drums that support the dome, eight Apostles dressed in white tunics are represented in couples. Each couple stands on both sides of a window. Below each window, there is either the representation of a perirrhanterion between two doves or two doves drinking from a basin. The Apostles look up to the sky and with vivid gestures, they glorify the Apocalyptic Cross at the centre of the dome. This scene is inspired by imperial iconography, but it is related to the Last Judgment, which will be announced by the Cross that will appear from the east. The four symbols of the Evangelists are also related to the Apocalyptic Cross because they will surround the Throne of God during the Last Judgment. Thus, the entire scene of the dome is a glorification of the Cross of Salvation, which is the key to eternity.
The other four Apostles are represented in couples, among undulating vine leaves, in the vaults of the western and the eastern arms of the chapel’s cross. This is probably an allusion to John 15,1-8 ‘I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit’. At the key of these two vaults, there is a medallion enclosing the Christogram and the apocalyptic letters Α Ω that symbolise the beginning and the end of the world, namely Jesus Christ. 
The northern and the southern barrel-vaults are decorated with stars, rosaces and tangled tendrils on a blue background, imitating the decoration of textiles. 
The lunettes of the western and the eastern arm are decorated with two deer drinking water from a small lake lying between them. The rest of the surface is occupied by acanthus branches. This scene symbolises the souls that are thirsty for the divine truth, according to Psalm 41 (42).
The scene of the Good Shepherd is depicted in the lunette of the northern arm, above the entrance. The background is light blue. Christ is represented in the middle, sitting on a rock. He wears a golden tunic and a purple mantle. He holds a Latin cross with His left hand, while with His right hand He touches tenderly one of the six sheep that surround Him in the heavenly setting. The fact that this scene is situated above the entrance indicates its connection with the passage from the gospel of John (10,7-10) ‘I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door; by me if any man enters in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.’ Thus, it underlines the importance of the entrance, as the gate to the State of God, which is the Church. Furthermore, the Good Shepherd can be linked to the Apocalyptic Cross at the centre of the dome, as it is a symbol of the triumphant Christ in Paradise, surrounded by the righteous. The scene has been inspired by the representation of Christ-Orpheus surrounded by animals. 
Opposite the entrance, in the lunette of the southern arm, on a light blue background, there is a man dressed in white, supporting a cross-shaped staff on his right shoulder and holding an open book with his left hand. He is moving quickly from the right to the centre, where there is a burning grill. On the left side is depicted an open bookcase; the four gospels appear on the shelves. Despite the lack of an inscription, it is accepted that this is S. Lorenzo, to whom is dedicated the entire chapel. As a deacon, S. Lorenzo was reading and guarding the gospels; this is why they are in the scene beside the burning grill, which is the instrument of S. Lorenzo’s passion. Therefore, this scene conveys the message that the Saint was tortured and became a martyr for the sake of the truth written in the gospels.
In terms of style, the mosaics of the so-called Mausoleum of Galla Placidia are attached to the Hellenistic tradition.",425,450,2226,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2024-02-01 23:42:18.477 +0100,2024-02-04 20:44:57.103 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2160,Manichaeans,43,Religious Group (v6),"Manichaeism was a dualistic religious movement that was founded in Persia in the 3rd century CE by Mani, who was known as the Apostle of Light or the supreme illuminator. Even though Manichaeism was broadly considered as a Christian heresy, which many Christian Fathers opposed with their writings, it was in fact a religion per se. The coherence of its doctrines and the rigidness of the structure and institutions, preserved throughout its history a unity and unique character. The founder of Manichaeism was Mani. He was of Iranian origin, born in 216 near Seleucia-Ctesiphon (southern Babylonia), in modern day Iraq, in the Parthian Empire. It is believed that his parents were members of the Jewish Christian Gnostic sect known as the Elcesaites, a sect active between 100 and 400 CE originating in the Transjordan region. Mani considered himself as the final successor in a long line of prophets, from Adam to Jesus Christ, also including Buddha and Zoroaster. His views on other, earlier religious systems was critical, since he believed that the effectiveness of religious experience, as well as the transcendental experiences were limited. He therefore regarded himself as the carrier of a universal message destined to replace any other religion. In his effort to prevent corruption and to ensure doctrinal unity, he recorded his teachings in writing and gave them canonical status during his lifetime. At the age of 24, after receiving a divine order that imposed him to publicly proclaim his doctrines, Mani began preaching throughout the Persian empire. Mani pursued to establish an ecumenical and universal religion that would integrate all the teachings of previously revealed truths, particularly those of Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. However, beyond mere syncretism, it sought the proclamation of a truth that could be perceived in different forms. Manichaeism, therefore, resembles Iranian and Indian religions, as well as Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism, depending on the context and in accordance with the different cultural background into which it spread. Mani’s missionary activity was unconstrained since he had the support of the Sasanian Empire. However, he failed to win the favor of the next generation of Persian royalty, the Emperor Bahram I, and with the disapproval of the Zoroastrian clergy Mani possibly died imprisoned (perhaps in 276-277) awaiting execution- his followers called that period the “Passion of the Illuminator” or Mani’s “crucifixion”. From its very first steps, the Manichaean church begun an active missionary activity to convert the world. Mani encouraged the translation of his writings into other languages and organized an extensive mission program. Manichaeism, hence, quickly spread west into the Roman Empire. From Egypt it moved across northern Africa, managing to convert figures such as the young Augustine, and even reached Rome in the early 4th century. It was during that century that the Manichaean expansion in the West reached its peak, establishing churches in southern Gaul and Spain, while it has also spread to the eastern provinces of the Persian Sasanian empire. The expansion of the Manichaeans to the East had already begun in the 7th century, after China’s conquest of East Turkistan. A Manichaean missionary reached the Chinese court in 694, and in 732 an edict gave the religion freedom of worship in China. When East Turkistan was conquered in the 8th century by the Uyghur Turks, one of their leaders adopted Manichaeism. Manichaeism thus remained the state religion of the Uyghur kingdom until its overthrow in 840. Manichaeism probably survived in East Turkistan until the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. In China it was forbidden in 843, but, although persecuted, it continued there at least until the 14th century. Beliefs similar to Manichaeism appeared during the Middle Ages in Europe in the so-called neo-Manichaean sects. Groups such as the Paulicians (Armenia, 7th century), the Bogomilists (Bulgaria, 10th century), and the Cathari or Albigensians (southern France, 12th century) bore strong resemblances to Manichaeism. Mani and the Manichaeans were fiercely attacked by both the Christian church and the Roman state. Several Church Fathers, such as Serapion of Thmuis, Titus of Bostra, Epiphanius of Salamis, Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine, John the Grammarian wrote treatises against Manichaeism, while philosophers also, such as Alexander of Lycopolis and Simplicius, attacked their doctrines. Hence, Manichaeism disappeared almost entirely from western Europe by the end of the 5th century and from the Byzantine empire during the 6th century.",250,843,2228,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2024-02-02 18:31:40.583 +0100,2024-02-05 16:04:55.981 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2161,Church of Hagios Vasileios tes Gephyras (of the bridge),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of Hagios Vassileios tes Gefyras (of the bridge) takes its name after its location, 1 km west of the old bridge of Arta. While originally believed to date back to the 9th century, some scholars argue for its redating to the second half of the 13th century. The presence of four layers of frescoes from different periods suggests subsequent renovations and continued use. The church has maintained its original free-cross plan, which includes a barrel-vaulted narthex on the west and a semicircular apse on the east side. The prominent cylindrical dome, now topped with a conical roof from a later period, features eight windows that illuminate the interior. Additional windows on the north and south sides, along with covered ones in the narthex, contribute to the overall lighting of the church. The church has two parekklesia, the south venerates St. Gregory, and the north in honor of St. John the Chrysostom. The exterior of the church is decorated with dogtooth freezes (a common ornamentation on the exterior of Late Byzantine churches in Epiros). The exterior is adorned with dogtooth friezes, a common feature in Late Byzantine churches in Epiros. Bands of square tiles on the north and east sides, arranged to create an interlocking diamond pattern and painted in four colors, provide further decorative elements (such decoration can be seen also in the church of the Paregoritissa and Panagia Vellas). Notably, two glazed ceramic icons immured in the east façade on either side of the window, feature the Crucifixion and the three Prelates (Vasileios, Gregory, and John). In terms of the church’s interior decoration, the earliest frescoes date to the second half of the 13th century. From this phase, discernable is the Virgin Platytera flanked by two angels and two hierarchs in an act of blessing right and left of the conch’s window, and below the window is a bearded saint. Near these figures are two unknown deacons standing, an unknown and the protomartyr Stephanos. From the 13th century are also the wall paintings on the north wall of the eastern aisle, which include three full-bodied saints, Panteleemon, Eleutherios, and an unknown one. While, the south wall includes Damian, Kosmas, and Theodotes. In the north conch, is the bust of St. Germanos and the full-bodied St. Vlasios. A 16th-century fresco of St. Basil decorates the south conch. Additional fresco layers date to the 17th-18th centuries. The first to mention the church was Seraphim Xenopoulos o Byzantios (1864-1894), the Metropolitan of Arta, who writes that the church was renovated in 1632 from the hieromonk Theoklito.",1250,2024,2229,1487,Sofia Pitouli,2024-02-02 21:29:05.190 +0100,2024-02-03 08:23:09.227 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2163,The Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Basilica of S. Apollinare in Classe is one of the most impressive buildings of the provincial Byzantine architecture. Its construction started in the era of Bishop Ursicinus, between 532 and 536, and it was carried out with the economic support of the financier Julianus Argentarius. The church was consecrated in 549 by Maximian, the first archbishop of Ravenna following the Byzantine reconquest. It was dedicated to the first bishop of Ravenna, St. Apolinnaris. It is a three-aisled, wooden-roofed basilica with a narthex on the west. To the north and south of the narthex, there were two rectangular towers. Three entrances provided access from the narthex to the nave and the aisles. Three doors were situated on the north and three more on the south exterior walls. Two small semicircular niches of unknown purpose were constructed at the western end of the aisles just inside the entrance. The aisles of the nave were separated by arcades of twelve columns made of Proconnesian marble. The columns bear windblown acanthus capitals. The impost blocks are plain, decorated with crosses, while the column bases are decorated on all four sides with geometric motifs. Initially the walls of the aisles, the apse, and the west wall were covered with Proconnesian marble wall revetment. Nowadays, large marble sarcophagi stand against the walls of the aisles. They were transferred there from the narthex and most of them contained the bodies of Ravenna's archbishops. The apse projects at the eastern end of the building; it is polygonal externally and circular on the interior. On both sides of the apse there are two square apsed chambers, which are accessed from the side aisles and from the exterior of the church. Between each chamber and the central apse, there are two small rooms, the western of which was two storied and not visible from inside or outside the church – they may have been used as small treasuries. Three fragments of floor mosaic have been excavated inside the church. The mosaic fragment from the western part of the southern aisle includes a fragment of an inscription commemorating a donation by secular figures.
The mosaic decoration of the church is limited in the area of the apse and the chancel arch; it dates to the mid- sixth century, but other surviving mosaics were made later. 
 The semi-dome is decorated with the most complex composition of the Justinian times. The representation of Saint Apollinaris to whom the church is dedicated, is combined with the Transfiguration of Christ. In the middle of the lower part stands Saint Apollinaris with both arms raised in a gesture of prayer. Above the saint there is a medallion enclosing the starred sky and a jewelled cross at the centre; a small bust of bearded Christ is represented at the junction point of the two arms of the cross. The cross is surrounded by inscriptions: above ΙΧΘΥΣ, below SALUS MUNDI and the letters Α Ω on both sides. The medallion floats mostly in a cloudy sky; the hand of God is represented above. Two male figures are depicted from the waist up on both sides of the medallion; on the left is Moses and on the right is Elijah. Their right hands point toward the cross. Further below, in a heavenly landscape three white sheep – one on the left and two on the right – gaze up at the cross. They are allegorical depictions of the three Apostles, Peter, John and Jacob, who witnessed the Transfiguration of Christ on Mount Tabor. This is a unique representation of the Transfiguration. The source and origin of this allegoric scheme, especially the replacement of the figure of Christ with a Cross, are unknown. Many scholars consider that it is inspired by patristic exegisis referring to the Cross as the symbol of Passion that leads to Heaven. Thus the heavenly landscape that does not portray the historical narrative becomes a vision of the future glory of Christ in His Second Coming that is foretold by the Transfiguration. However, Mauskopf Deliyannis noted that ‘there are numerous possible interpretations, any and all of which may be viable’.
Saint Apollinaris does not look up at the Transfiguration scene, but out into the church. He is surrounded by twelve sheep, separated by clusters of white lilies and red roses under their feet. These sheep do not symbolise the Apostles, but the congregation of Apollinaris. The saint is praying for the faithful directly to the triumphant Christ.
Between the five windows of the apse four bishops of Ravenna, Ecclesius, Severus, Ursus and Ursicinus, are represented standing in niches, between columns that support conches, below which are curtains and votive crowns.
In the centre of the chancel arch, in  the top zone, a medallion enclosing Christ dressed in purple is represented in a dark blue background filled with red and blue clouds. The symbols of the four Evangelists float among these clouds: the Eagle (John), the Angel (Matthew), the Lion (Mark) and the Ox (Luke). Below this zone, twelve sheep exit from the walled cities of Jerusalem on the left and Bethlehem on the right. On the haunches of the arch are two palms and further below, the archangels Michael and Gabriel in imperial clothes. The busts of the evangelists Mathew and Luke, under the sheep, were made in the twelfth century. Apart from the two panels that depict the archangels, which belong to the original program, the mosaics of the chancel arch were largely made or remade between the seventh and the twelfth centuries. In the seventh century, at the time of archbishop Reparatus (671-677) or later, two panels were made on the outmost walls of the apse. The left panel depicts the granting of privileges by Emperor Constantine IV (668-685) and his brothers Heraclius and Tiberius to archbishop Reparatus. The right panel represents in one composition the three Old Testament sacrifices: Abel offering the lamb, Melchisedek offering bread and wine, and the sacrifice of Abraham. These events are considered as prefigurations of the Holy Eucharist.
The mosaics of Saint’Apollinare in Classe highlight the different functions of the archbishop, including both his religious and political role.",532,549,2231,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2024-02-04 16:54:26.912 +0100,2024-02-08 00:26:53.645 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2164,Basilica of San Vitale,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of San Vitale, located in northwestern Ravenna, is the nearest known relative of the church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus built by Justinian in Constantinople around the same time, although the latter had not served as a direct model. The basilica was initially the martyrium of Saint Vitalis, the patron of Ravenna. Before the mid-tenth century, but unknown exactly when, the church was acquired by a Benedictine monastery, to which it belonged until 1860, when it was dissolved. The basilica of San Vitale was erected during the reign of Justinian (527-565). Julianus Argentarius, a Greek‑speaking local banker and architect, sponsored the construction commanded by bishop Ecclesius (521-532).  The church was consecrated by bishop Maximian in 547. However, bishop Victor (538-545) was most probably the person who has played a substantial role in the construction of the basilica, as his monogram appear in many places. The architectural design but also the decoration of San Vitale were influenced by the latest trends in Constantinople. Even though Ravenna was at the time the capital of the Ostrogoth kingdom, it was heavily influenced by Byzantium. The basilica is octagonal. It has a diameter of c. 40 m., while its octagonal naos has eight inner piers joined by arches that support the dome. The central section is surrounded by two superposed ambulatories. One of the arches leads to the presbytery and the apse. It has also two rooms with apse and domed chapels. The south one has sheltered the tombs of bishops Ecclesius, Ursicinus, and Victor. Although most parts of the original building have survived, the vaults replaced the wooden ceilings of the ambulatory and the gallery. The exterior buttresses were added perhaps in the late 12th century. The southern stair tower was transformed into a bell tower, which collapsed in 1688. The basilica was restored in the 16th century and chapels were created in the 18th century. In the early 20th century the basilica was excavated and reconstructed in its presumed original form. A small rectangular chapel was discovered under the original floor, presumably the 5th-century martyrium of St. Vitalis. 
San Vitale was decorated with marble wall revetment, mosaics and marble pavements, columns and capitals, stucco decoration, painted glass windows, and figural mosaics. It also had marble liturgical furnishings, including an altar, ciborium, and transennae, currently exhibited at the Museo Nazionale. The original columns, capitals, and impost blocks are still in place, but most of the wall revetments and pavements are modern reconstructions. Part of the floor decoration was remade in the 1540s, while the other two were repaired in the early 18th century. In 1931, excavation revealed two segments of the original floor, after which the entire level was lowered to the original level. The apse and presbytery floor were created between the 1910s-1930s. The apse, the walls of the presbytery and the triumphal arch are covered with mosaics. They presumably predate by a couple of years the consecration of the basilica in 547, though the panel with Justinian and bishop Maximian was perhaps made around the time of the consecration. It is possible that the dome was originally decorated with mosaics, although there are no traces left. 
A series of mosaics in the lunettes above the triforia depict scenes of sacrifices from the Old Testament. Each lunette is decorated by a pair of angels holding a medallion with a cross. On the walls, next to the windows are depicted the four Evangelists below their symbols. The vault of the presbytery is decorated with leaves, fruits and flowers, forming a crown around the Lamb of God. The crown is supported by four angels. Above the arches, two angels hold a disc and beside them are represented the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. The intrados of the great triumphal arch is decorated with fifteen medallions (Jesus Christ, twelve Apostles, the sons of Saint Vitale: Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius). The Theophany which has begun in 525 under bishop Ecclesius has a great gold fascia with twining flowers, birds, and cornucopia. In the apse, Christ is depicted seated, flanked by angels, offering the martyr’s crown to Saint Vitale, while on his left, bishop Ecclesius offers a model of the church. Lower is depicted the Emperor Justinian I with generals Belisarius and Narses, bishop Maximian, guards and deacons. The name of bishop Maximian was added later, suggesting that the composition may have been modified ca. 547. On the opposite wall is depicted Empress Theodora with court women and eunuchs. 
The basilica is one of the eight Early Christian monuments of Ravenna that were inscribed in 1996 in the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites.",527,2024,2232,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-02-04 20:25:12.405 +0100,2024-02-05 18:38:09.080 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2166,Judaism in Byzantium,43,Religious Group (v6),"Jewish communities lived throughout the Byzantine Empire, as demonstrated by both historical sources and by archaeological excavations. 

From an archaeological standpoint, one of the most thoroughly researched Jewish communities in Byzantium to date is the Jewish community at Sardis, where a synagogue has been excavated and restored. In addition, graffiti and finds from the Byzantine shops at Sardis provide information about the occupations of some members of the community.

Archaeological evidence also indicates a Byzantine Jewish presence at Anemurium, Ephesus, Hierapolis (Pamukkale), and Sardis during the early Byzantine period; outside of Anatolia, sites such as Stobi, Tell Beit Mirsim, and Jerusalem had Jewish communities while under Byzantine rule (Crawford, p. 154).

For the period from ca. 300-700 CE, the Jewish communities of the Byzantine Empire are most extensively studied through the archaeological record, significant recent historical works notwithstanding (see Kalmin, below). However, the period from 700 onward allows for a more detailed historical analysis, due to the greater survival of primary source texts, such as the travels of Benjamin of Tudela in the 12th century. From the twelfth century onward, Jewish communities throughout the Byzantine Empire (as well as formerly Byzantine lands) have been recorded across the western half of Anatolia, in the Aegean, as well as throughout the Balkan and Peloponnesian peninsulas (Bowman p. 51, 173).

Although Jews were typically allowed to exist as a legally recognized, autonomous groups within the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine period also included periods of persecution and forced conversion. In 721-2, Leo III issued an edict which required baptism both for Jews and for Montanists. This led to some Jewish communities leaving the empire, while others converted, sometimes continuing to practice Judaism in secret (Starr p. 2). Emperor Basil II (r. 867-886) also enacted measures to convert the Byzantine Jews, first through persuasion, and later through compulsion (Starr p. 4).

Jews of the Byzantine Empire were typically referred to as ""Romaniotes"" (Benjamin of Tudela). The Byzantine Empire included both Karaite and Rabbanite communities.",395,1453,1893,1520,Sofia Kane,2024-02-05 12:46:28.503 +0100,2024-02-22 13:39:08.561 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2167,Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"A church was purportedly first constructed on this site in the 4th century,  and was rebuilt under the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian (r. 527-565). The earliest surviving archaeological evidence dates from the sixth century (Oates p. 226).

After being damaged during the Latin period following the Fourth Crusade (1204), the church was repaired under the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II (1282-1328). The church's mosaics are from this period; several were commissioned between 1315 and 1321 by Theodore Metochites.

Grand Vizier Hadim Ali Pasha, serving under the Ottoman emperor Bayezid II, converted the church into a mosque (Kariye Camii) in 1511, 58 years after the conquest of Constantinople. The mosaics were covered by plaster.

The structure was designated as a museum in 1945. Between 1947 and 1948, the mosaics were restored, the building was conserved, and excavations were undertaken by the Byzantine Institute of America. The building was reconverted into a mosque in 2020.",300,2024,2234,1520,Sofia Kane,2024-02-05 15:33:56.482 +0100,2024-02-24 15:18:17.980 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2169,Church of the Holy Savior in Chora,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of the Holy Savior in Chora represents one of the most important examples of ecclesiastical art and architecture in the former Byzantine capital of Constantinople, modern day Istanbul. It is known particularly for the extensive mural cycles carried out under the patronage of Theodoros Metochites, a Palaiologan scholar, humanist, and government official, at the beginning of the fourteenth century. Originally founded in the fourth century, and named for its position in the countryside beyond the Constantinian Wall, the erection of the Theodosian Walls would place it, albeit scarcely, within the city boundaries. By the eleventh century, however, the edifice had presumably fallen into disrepair, as it was rebuilt as a cross-in-square church by the mother-in-law of Alexios I Komnenos, and, following an earthquake in the early twelfth-century, was renovated under the auspices of Isaakios Komnenos the Sebastokrator, that emperor's son, which left us with most of the architectural fabric of the church as may be seen to this day. Presumably, the renewed importance of the church reflected the residence of the imperial family at nearby Blachernai during this period. In the early-fourteenth century, Theodoros Metochites, in addition to sponsoring an ecclesiastical decorative cycle which remains one of the most complete examples surviving from the latter Byzantine Empire, also added at least the outer narthex to the building, as well as a funerary side-chapel, or parekklesion, intended for the interment of himself and his family, giving the church its somewhat idiosyncratic and irregular plan (especially in comparison with contemporary examples). Each narthex is decorated with extensive mosaic cycles on the vaulting, the walls and, most notably, the lunettes over the doorways. The exonarthex contains a decorative cycle of the nativity and early-life of Jesus (particularly notable for a scene depicting the enrollment of the holy family for taxation before Governor Quirinus in addition to a depiction of the Journey to Bethlehem), as well as a figure of Christ Pantokrator in one of the lunettes who is labeled as 'the land (chora) of the living"" an obvious pun on the name of the church itself, echoed, as well, in an image of a prayerful Theotokos labeled ""the container (chora) of the uncontainable (achoritou)"". The esonarthex is decorated on the interior of its two dome's with mosaics depicting the ancestors of Christ, arrayed in a ring around images of Christ Pantokrator and the Theotokos and Child at the apexes of the domes. The bays and lunettes also contain a narrative cycle drawn from the lives of the Theotokos and her parents (rather like the decorative cycle in the Kokkinobaphos Homilies). Most notable, however, are a monumental Deesis complete with donor portraits of some of the churches former patrons Isaakios Komnenos and a certain nun identified as 'Melania, Lady of the Mongols' indicating that she may be the illegitimate daughter of Michael VIII who was sent as a bride to the Mongol Court at the end of the 13th century, as well as a depiction of a kneeling Theodoros Metochites, arrayed in the colorful regalia of a Byzantine high official, presents a model of his church to Christ with an expression of soft and mannerly yearning, and a particularly accomplished depiction of Saint Peter. The naos, in contrast to the narthices, is largely decorated with marble revetments framing only a few mosaic panels; a depiction of the Koimesis over the entryway and figures of Christ and the Theotokos flanking the area where the iconostasis must once have stood. The upper parts of the walls, dome, and vaulting must have also once been decorated, whether in mosaic or fresco, but this has not survived. The Parekklesion differs from the rest of the church in that the decorations, including a particularly evocative depiction of the Anastasis, are executed in fresco rather than mosaic. All of the interior decorative cycle, executed in whatever medium, is widely considered representative of the elegant, naturalistic, and emotionally charged artwork of the Palaiologan period, echoing and anticipating roughly contemporary developments in Italy. Following the Ottoman Conquest of the city, the Chora was transformed into a mosque known as the Kariye Camii, a minaret was added at one corner, and its interior decorations were covered over in plaster. In 1945 it was turned into a Museum by the Turkish Republic, who invited Thomas Whittmore and Paul Underwood from Dumbarton Oaks to undertake the restoration of the site. Nevertheless, in the febrile atmosphere of an Islamizing modern Turkey, it has been reconverted into a mosque as of 2019 and thence closed indefinitely",330,2024,2236,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2024-02-07 20:58:03.196 +0100,2024-02-09 20:24:47.831 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2170,Liber Pontificalis,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Liber Pontificalis is a collection of biographies of the Popes of Rome from Saint Peter to the pontiffs of the 15th Century. Rather than representing a cohesive work, it is a collection of materials compiled and amended unsystematically over the course of perhaps a millennium, with the various additions and redactions reflecting differing historical circumstances and agendas. Problems of authorship loom large, but must be treated as briefly as possible. The earliest sections of the collection extending through the pontificates of the fourth and fifth centuries, may well have a Late Antique origin, ascribed in the Middle Ages (via Rabanus Maurus) to Saint Jerome and other holy persons, but by modern scholarship, following the eminent Duchesne, to an anonymous 5th or 6th century chronicler or series of chroniclers. This early section likely made use of the Catalogus Liberianus, as well as of earlier sources such as the papal catalogue attributed to Hippolytus of Rome. The accounts of the pontificates postdating the sixth century are associated, largely, with scholars attached to the papal court of the eighth and ninth centuries. These have traditionally been amalgamated with the figure of Anastasius Bibliothecarius, though only one entry has been ascribed to him. Entries for the popes between the latter ninth century and the eleventh centuries are either non-existent or extremely brief. The first major revivals of the project of papal biography which would eventually be included in the printed editions of the Liber Pontificalis occurred in the twelfth century, associated by Duchesne with Pandulf of Lucca, Odo of St. Albans, and Petrus Guillermi, and continued by a variety of other figures including Martin of Opava, who extended the chronicle into the 13th century. Unknown authors continued to make additions to the catalogue of popes via their own works in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Indeed, the collection of all, or at least large portions, of these biographical works together by early-modern antiquarians and their publication in this form may be said to represent the true reification of the 'Liber Pontificalis' as a self-contained work, an idea which would later be thoroughly deconstructed, with the scholarly analyses of Duchesne and Mommsen playing some large part in this process. Depending on the period examined and even the individual biography under scrutiny, the content of the text changes, but certain subjects are typically focused upon, including the dates of a particular pontificate, dates of birth and death and length of tenure as pope, familial and professional background of the pontiff in question, and the major controversies and achievements of their reigns, with particular focus on the construction and endowment of Roman churches. Accepted virtually uncritically as a source until the eighteenth century, it has long been the subject of sustained scholarly enquiry which has served to render its chain of authorship more visible, but which has also problematized many of its claims. The difficulty of dating and attributing certain entries makes reading them in terms of specific historical contexts particularly difficult. Nevertheless, the Liber Pontificalis represents a fertile and unusually comprehensive source for papal history.",450,1500,146,1320,Ethan Schmidt,2024-02-08 08:00:55.403 +0100,2024-02-08 19:08:25.843 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2172,The Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Basilica of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo is the most imposing building constructed during the reign of the Ostrogothic King Theoderic. It was built right next to Theoderic’s palace and it was initially dedicated to Christ the Saviour. After Ravenna was reconquered by the Byzantines, the basilica was taken from the Arians; it was converted to Orthodoxy (c. 561) and was dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours who was known for his battles against heresies. In Ravenna, Saint Martin was honoured and a miraculous icon depicting him was kept in the church of Saints John and Paul. In 856, the relics of Saint Apollinaris were transferred from the Basilica of Sant’Apollinare in Classe to Sant’Apollinare Nuovo, as a means of protection against the pirate raids.
Sant’Apollinare Nuovo is a three-aisled basilica with a projecting apse, five-sided on the exterior and semi-circular on the interior. The original building, which underwent numerous alterations through time, was probably constructed of reused bricks. According to Agnellus, it included a baptistery and a chapel, but none of these structures is preserved nowadays. It is also presumed that there was a narthex or atrium in the western part of the church. The twelve columns that compose the colonnade at both sides of the central aisle were made of Proconnesian marble and so were their bases and capitals. Eleven windows pierce the walls above the arcade of the nave. On the exterior, engaged arcades of pilasters surround the windows.
The mosaic decoration is splendid and it occupies the walls above the colonnade of the central aisle. It is divided into three horizontal zones. The mosaics of the uppermost and the middle zone are dated to c. 500 and they were made in the era of Theoderic, whereas those of the lowest zone are dated to the Justinian period (c. 561). 
The uppermost zone is divided into rectangular panels depicting scenes from the Life, the Passion and the Resurrection of Christ, which are not arranged in chronological order. From west to east, the following scenes are represented: (northern wall) Jesus heals the paralytic of Bethesda, Jesus sends demons into swine, Jesus heals the paralytic of Capernaum, Parable of the sheep and the goats, Parable of the poor widow’s mite, Parable of the Pharisee and Publican, Jesus rises Lazarus, Jesus and the Samaritan woman, Jesus with the haemorrhaging of Canaanite woman, Jesus heals the two blind men, Jesus calls Peter and Andrew, Jesus multiples bread and fishes, the Wedding at Cana; (southern wall) Jesus appears to Thomas and apostles, Jesus appears on the road to Emmaus, Two Marys and the Angel at the Tomb, Jesus is led to the Crucifixion, Jesus before Pilate, Judas’ repentance, Peter’s denial, Jesus prophesies Peter’s denial, Jesus before Caiaphas, Jesus taken prisoner, The betrayal by Judas, Jesus prays in the garden of Gethsemane, the Last Supper. These episodes are represented above each window. On the north wall, Christ is represented young and beardless, while on the southern wall, he is mature and bearded. Between the Christological scenes, there are rectangular panels representing a suspended jewelled crown within a colourful shell, on top of which two doves are flanking a golden cross. 
In the middle zone are depicted thirty-two standing male figures inside rectangular panels that occupy the spaces between the eleven windows. They are dressed in white and hold a scroll or a codex. They are identified as prophets or preachers of the Gospel. The spandrels above each window are decorated with birds facing a vase.
The lowest zone is decorated with representations of the cities of Classe (northern wall) and Ravenna (southern wall), and processions of saints offering crowns. On the northern wall, the Three Magi lead a procession of Virgins to the Virgin and Child, and on the southern wall, twenty-six male martyrs offer their crowns to the enthroned Christ. It is considered that these processions have replaced relevant scenes that included King Theoderic, members of this family and dignitaries of his court. 
Finally, on the western entrance wall, a small fragment of mosaic represents Justinian and can be dated to the same period as the mosaics of the lowest zone.",504,561,2237,1088,Alexandra Konstantinidou,2024-02-08 14:27:54.306 +0100,2024-02-10 02:08:22.333 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2173,"Irenaeus of Lyons, ""Against Heresies""",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Irenaeus of Lyons is one of the most important figures of the Christian Church of the 2nd century. He appears at the end of the second century with the aim to express a new type of literature, the so-called Literature of Tradition, which exceeds Apologetics and marks the beginning of a new, more universal expression of the ecclesiastical body. Where and when Irenaeus was born is not known. His birth cannot even be precisely determined. According to him, during his childhood he was associated with the bishop of Smyrna St. Polycarp. He was probably born in or near the city of Smyrna, in a Christian family. According to St. Jerome, Irenaeus had been a student of Papias of Hierapolis, He studied theology and perhaps the secular paideia of his time. It seems however that he had not received a philosophical education. It is certain though that he was well versed in rhetoric. It is not certain when Irenaeus moved to Lyon, yet it seems plausible that this happened around or before 177 CE. The reasons for his settlement there were either ecclesiastical or related with family issues, since Lyon was an important city, with a strong Christian and Greek-speaking element. According to Gregory of Tours, Irenaeus had been sent there by St. Polycarp. Whatever the case may be, it is certain that he had already been ordained as presbyter when he arrived at the French city. A testimony regarding his arrival in Lyon mentions that Irenaeus had welcomed a group of enthusiastic Phrygian Christians, who believed that the second coming of Christ would take place in Lyon, at a time when Pope Eleutherus (ca. 174 - ca. 189) was persistently asked to ratify condemnations against Montanist bishops. At the time of his settlement in Lyon, Montanism movement was in full swing, while at the same time persecution by the Roman authorities was developing. Thus, he immediately begins writing activity, writing to the people of Asia Minor about the ongoing problems, as well as to the Pope of Rome. Assuming his duties as bishop of Lyon in 177 or 178 CE, he launches an intensive project that aims not only to the evangelization of the Greek and Latin speakers, but also of the Celts, expanding his activity as far as southern France and western Germany. He actively fights against the heresies, especially the Gnostics, constantly traveling, founding schools, and writing books. He soon realizes that it is was not enough to confront a heretical teaching at the time, but through coordinated reorganization and safeguarding of the teaching of the church. By the time of Irenaeus, a great number of heresies were thriving in the Roman Empire.  Particularly in his episcopal see, the teachings of various Gnostic groups arrived through Greek merchants, who had begun an oratorial campaign, teaching that the material world was the accidental creation of an evil god, from which we are to escape by the pursuit of gnosis. Irenaeus argued that the true gnosis is in fact knowledge of Christ, which redeems rather than escapes from bodily existence. Irenaeus therefore set his sights to compile a work, which will not refute any heresy individually, but will expose the teaching of all of them. The result of his effort is the ""Against Heresies"", a voluminous work of five books. The original, Greek text is lost; only some extensive passages survive. Yet, Irenaeus’s opus is known to us through a Latin translation, made sometime before the times of St. Augustine. The translation we possess today comes from about 20 manuscripts, with the oldest dating back to the 9th century. In his prologue, Irenaeus declares his sorrow for the “fall” of Christians into heresies, due to their ignorance. He also declares that his main purpose is to demonstrate the falsity of these heresies. In the first book, the first ten chapters refer to the system of Valentinus; from chapters 11 to chapter 21st Irenaeus discusses the heretic teachings of Secundus, Ptolemy, Mark, and until the end references are made to all the Gnostics known during his times, as well as some previous ones (Simon the magician, Menander, Saturnilos, Vasileides, Karpocrates, Cyrinth, Ebionites, Nicolaites, Kerdons, Marcion, Tatianus, Varbelians, Ophians, Cainites). In the second book, Irenaeus discusses the theory of God and the world according to the Gnostics, and especially the Valentinians, and provides instructions to his readers on the correct interpretation of the Scriptures. He also refers to the distinction that the Valentinians made between human and divine inspiration. Irenaeus’s chief objective in these two books is to expose the faith and the tradition of the Church. In the third book, he refers to what is the Apostolic Tradition of the Church, the Apostles, the Monarchy of God, Christ and ends his discussion with a prayer. The fourth book begins with the discussion on the unity of the Old and the New Testament, the patterns and prophecies found in the books of the Old Testament, as well as the teaching of parables. Finally, in the fifth book, Irenaeus refers to the teaching of the Lord and of the Apostle Paul; the resurrection; the Creator and Father, as witnessed by the words of Jesus himself. This fifth book will eventually become very popular, since almost all of the subsequent Church Fathers, such as Hippolytus of Rome, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, etc will cite it in their own writings.",130,202,2238,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2024-02-09 17:11:08.820 +0100,2024-02-11 11:20:48.853 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2174,Church of St. Demetrios Katsouris,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of St. Demetrios Katsouris stands in the village of Plissioi, situated 5 km west of Arta. During the time of the Despotate of Epirus, Arta served as the despotate’s capital. The church is among the few monuments that date to the first three decades of the thirteenth century, showcasing the artistic tradition during the beginning of the Despotate of Epirus. The cross-in-square church (with variations), featuring a dome supported by four pillars and standing on four crossed arches forming a cross, was originally constructed in the 9th century. In the 13th century, the church’s interior was painted in two phases, and additions were included in the 18th or beginning of the 19th century. Today, the church boasts a 19th-century narthex added in 1868 and a bell tower built in 1911. Scholars have noted the church’s connection to John Apokaukos, Metropolitan of Nafpaktos. According to Apokaukos, the church was initially a katholikon as mentioned in 1229. It has been known by the name Katsouris since then, though scholars lack information on the origin of this name. Due to its 13th-century decoration, especially of the dome, the church is regarded as a testament to the aspirations of the Despotate and the desire to reclaim Constantinople, as proposed by Papamastorakis (1992) and later supported by Fundić (2022). The dome, which features Christ Pantokrator, is supported by a zone of angels in prayer, followed by a zone decorated with fourteen prophets. Particularly noteworthy are the scrolls held by the prophets, which symbolize this vision of the city’s recapture. Scholars explain that the inscriptions on the scrolls tell the story of the liberation of Israel and their return from Babylon to Israel. Moreover, these scrolls may be connected to the texts of Apokaukos (Fundić 2022), who advocated for the recapture of Constantinople by Despot Theodore Komnenos Doukas (r. 1215-30). It has been suggested that the church may have been commissioned by Apokaukos or another elite member of the Despotate. The dome’s pendentives include the three unidentified evangelists and evangelist Mark. Additional prophets decorate the supporting arches of the dome, of which three are unidentified, while identifiable are Prophet Solomon, Prophet David, and Prophet Aaron. The church includes the Annunciation, scenes from the Life of Christ, the Communion of the Apostles and the Ascension (sanctuary, second phase). In the bema apse appears the Virgin Platytera (second phase) and below the composition are unidentified hierarchs, followed below by another unidentified hierarch, St. Epiphanios, an unidentified saint, St. Nikephoros, St. Vlassios, St. Modestos, and St. Polykarpos (these saints are attributed to the first phase of the 13th century). The diakonikon is decorated with Christ (“the one in another form”, second phase) in the conch, while scenes of Abraham’s sacrifice, the Reception of the Angels by Abraham, and the Hospitality of Abraham (second phase) follow, including renderings of saints and an unidentified Hosios confessor. The prothesis includes hierarchs and saints in medallions and full length portraits and St. John the Theologian at its conch. The prothesis bears later paintings as well.  The interior is also ornamented with sculptural decoration, including capitals from the Roman period and one from the 6th century, which point to spolia and re-use of available material. The sculptural decoration appears also above the northeast window of the narthex, on the three-lobed windows of the apse, and on the marble templon (today in wood). There are two marble chancel barriers, one of which dates to the 11th century and features a chained cross and floral decoration. While the second (13th century), includes a rhombus shape enclosing an eagle that holds a hare with its feet.",800,2024,2239,1487,Sofia Pitouli,2024-02-09 17:43:51.065 +0100,2024-02-09 17:44:25.861 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2177,The Covenant Ceremony in the Community Rule (1QS),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Covenant Ceremony is a section of the Community Rule (1QS 1:16–2:18), one of the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is an initiation ceremony for members joining the community and a reminder of group boundaries and beliefs for those who have previously joined the group. The ceremony itself consists of three parts: a description of the community which the initiates join (referred to as the order of the yahad) and a blessing of God; a description of God’s deeds for Israel (led by the priests) and the sins of Israel (led by the Levites) to which the initiates respond with confession of their own sins and priests bless God's lot and the Levites curse Belial's lot; and a statement regarding the priests' and the Levites’ cursing those who come to the covenant ceremony with impure or false motives. The initiates assent to the conclusion of each major section of the ceremony with a collective “Amen, amen.” There is no specific timing for the ritual’s performance described within the text, but textual references hint that it may have taken place during the festival of weeks, which is associated with covenant-making traditions. The ceremony pairs blessings and confessions to ensure that those who join the covenant with pure heart and mind receive the blessing and those who do not are cursed. Only those initiated into the community via the ceremony were able to access purification and atonement from their God. The best manuscript of the Covenant Ceremony is the Community Rule (S) 1QS 1:16-2:18, though fragments with parallel textual material have been found in other manuscripts (4Q256, 4Q257, and 5Q11). All texts of the Covenant Ceremony are written in Hebrew, and all but 4Q257 (which is written on papyrus) are leather scrolls. Extant manuscripts are dated to the first century BCE. There are no variants in the textual material across these manuscripts but the material is poorly preserved. This text bears similarities to other covenant ceremonies, but is unique in its pairing of blessings, curses, and the role of the priests and Levites.",-100,0,2260,1539,Brandon Brown,2024-02-12 06:11:33.627 +0100,2024-03-14 17:52:07.867 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World
2180,Cao Đài,43,Religious Group (v6),"Cao Đài is a syncretic indigenous Vietnamese religion that was born out of the milieu of the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam and the borderlands of Vietnam and Cambodia. Although the religion is monotheistic, it also intentionally blends elements of Catholicism, Vietnamese folk traditions, Chinese religions (especially the sanjiao or tâm giáo, Daoism, Confucianism, and Chinese influenced/Chinese Buddhism), and more global understandings of revelation. For instance, the Prophet Muhammed is considered part of the ""Prophets of the Christian Era"" along with the Prophet Baab (Bahai'i), Moses (Judaism), and Jesus (Christianity). The religion was founded by Ngô Văn Chiêu, who was a Vietnamese administrator and district head in the French colony of Cochinchina. Officially, this new religion became name as the Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ (Great way of the Third Time of Redemption,"" indicating the perception that the early 20th century was to be a new era of revealed truth. Thus, it is not entirely surprising that modern historical figures, such as the French author Victor Hugo, the Chinese nationalist Sun Yat Sen, and Vietnamese national poet-saint, Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm (1491-1585) were established as saints. During the First Indochina War, the Cao Đài movement formed their own militia, which was then subordinated to the Republic of Vietnam military (ARVN) during the Second Indochina War. Typically anti-communist during the Second Indochina War, Cao Đài militia members were treated with extra scrutiny during and after the subsequent reunification of Vietnam in 1976. Consequentially, substantial Cao Đài diasporas can be found in France, the United States, Canada and Australia. However, after normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States in 1995, during a period of liberalization in the late 1990s, Cao Đài recognition in Vietnam was officially granted in 1997. Thus, after 1997, Cao Đài practice has been relatively unrestricted and formally recognized. In recent decades, splinter schools or offshoots of the officially recognized Cao Đài religion have complained about scolding and harassment from state sanctioned Cao Đài authorities. Such debates have emerged in a context where state-sanctioned religious sites, especially the main Cao Đài temple in Tây Ninh province--just north of Hồ Chí Minh City, have become major sites for the international tourist community to visit. Finally, in the past two decades, the role of remissions from the diaspora community to Cao Đài organizations in Vietnam has become increasingly significant.",1921,2024,2244,520,William Noseworthy,2024-02-12 20:33:46.646 +0100,2024-03-25 17:59:27.854 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2182,Tatev (Տաթևի),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Tatev Monastic complex is located on a mountainous plateau in the Syunik province of Armenia near the village of Halidzor. In the medieval period served as both a major religious, political, educational and cultural centre for the region. Although the monastic complex known today was not built until the ninth century, a small church built atop of a ruined pagan temple had been constructed in the fourth century. The site became a bishophric seat in the ninth century. In the fourteenth century under Orbelian rule the University of Tatev was established at the site. At this time, it also became a prolific centre for the production of illuminated manuscripts and miniature painting. The site suffered many invasions from the Seljuks, Persians, and Mongols throughout its history as well as several earthquakes and has undergone several significant reconstructions. The oldest church in the complex is the Church of Saint Gregory, which was completed in 848 and was royally commissioned by Prince Philip of Syunik. The church has a vaulted ceiling, with no dome and was later attached to the Church of Saint Paul and Saint Peter, which completed construction in 906. This church features a basilica floorplan, with the addition of a hall made in the 11th century. The church  by Prince Ashot, Princess Shushan, Prince Grigor Supan and Prince Dzagik at the request of Bishop Hovahnnes of Syunik. Relief portraits of Prince Ashot and Princess Shushan flanked by snakes appear on the eastern exterior niches. 10th century frescos with inscriptions decorate the interior, including images of Christ enthroned, the Last Judgement, and the Nativity.The third church on the site, the Church of the Holy Mother of God (Surp Astvatsatsin) was built in 1087 on top of the mausoleum and sits along the northern fortification walls. The site also includes a great library, a multi-leveled refectory, a bell-tower, monk cells, bakery, winery, and several administrative buildings and university classrooms and workshops within its fortified walls. The site also famously features a unique decorative column called the Gavazan dedicated to the trinity, which according to lore helped the sites inhabitants predict earthquakes. The site was used as bisophric seat and educational centre until the 18th century. The site still remains an active religious site but is also one of the countries premier tourist attractions. The site has undergone a significant restoration in recent years and is part of a major national revival project. The remote and mountainous location of the site was addressed with the addition of an aerial tramway brings tourists from nearby Halidzor to the summit of Tatev.

2183,"Gregory of Nyssa ""On the Soul and the Resurrection""",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Gregory of Nyssa, the younger brother of St. Basil the Great (c. 330-379) was born around 330 and was educated chiefly by Basil, at the family’s monastic convent near the river Iris, in Cappadocia.  Like his older brother, he opted at first for a secular career in rhetoric. Unlike Basil however, he even got married. Under the influence of his close friends, especially Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329-389), he retired to the same monastery on the Iris which his brother, Basil, founded. In 371, his ecclesiastical career advanced further, being elevated to the episcopal seat of Nyssa (in modern central Turkey), a small town in St. Basil’s metropolitan district of Caesarea. Not being able to cope with administrative tasks as efficiently as his brother, Basil, Gregory lacked the diplomatic skills that would help him to deal with the ecclesiastical issues -mainly the Arian teachings and their influence- of his time. Despite his political levity, Gregory was a charismatic writer and a theologian, well versed in both the Scriptures and secular philosophy. His work “On the Soul and the Resurrection” is one of the most influential works of Orthodox Patristic literature. After St. Basil’s death in early 379, Gregory visited his sister, Macrina, at the convent on the river Iris where she was the abbess. Here he sought consolation concerning the recent loss of his brother, only to find that his sister too was soon to die. Modeled upon the deathbed dialogue of Socrates in Plato’s, “Phaedo”, Gregory composes a deathbed dialogue between his sister and himself wherein he plays the ""devil’s advocate"" while Macrina presents the proper Christian understanding concerning the immortality of the soul and the hope of the resurrection. The ideas attributed to Macrina are those of the author himself. In this deathbed discussion, Macrina and Gregory reason out the philosophical underpinnings of the Christian’s hope: human reason enlightened by the Holy Spirit can supplement one’s theological endeavors and thus bolster one’s faith. Reason, therefore, serves as a handmaiden to theology which can support one’s faith when it wavers. Such a method reveals the work’s primary audience, namely a Christian one. As a result, the “On the Soul and the Resurrection” displays quite well Gregory’s profound philosophical and literary learning. It also serves as an example of the positive role secular learning can play in Christian life and thought. The “On the Soul and the Resurrection” therefore displays much of the flexibility toward contemporary Greek though and literary style discussed above. Due to the nature of this work, theological anthrolopogy plays a key role, especially concerning the nature of the human soul in its relationship to the human body and to the divine nature. The theological anthropology which underlies this book will prove very influential in later Orthodox Christian ascetical and theological writings.",335,394,2246,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2024-02-13 08:20:59.007 +0100,2024-02-14 19:14:52.883 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2184,Zvartnots (Զուարթնոց),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The ruined Cathedral of Zvartnots, located near the apostolic holy see of Etchmiadzin (Vagharshapat), is among the most famous early Christian sites in Armenia. The cathedral was commissioned in 643 and was consecrated in 652 by the Catholicos Nerses III, who was known as “the builder” on account of his many monumental building projects and contributions to ecclesiastical architecture while head of the Apostolic church. Nerses selected the site for this church as it was believed to be the location of where the Armenian King Trdat and Saint Gregory the Illuminator met. The church was dedicated to the Angels that appeared to St. Gregory, who is championed in the Armenian tradition as having converted the Armenian King to Christianity, leading the nation to adopt Christianity as their state religion. 

Due to the invasions in Dvin, the Palace of the Catholicos was moved from Dvin to the Zvarnots, making it a site of great religious and political influence. 
The once-domed cathedral features a centrally planned aisled tetraconch floorplan, surrounded by a circular ambulatory situated on a stepped crepidoma. It was built with locally quarried volcanic stone, primarily basalt and tufa. Unique in Armenian ecclesiastical architecture is Zvarnots use of ionic column capitals, some of which bare Greek monograms and eagle reliefs. Floral and vining vegetal and pomegranate reliefs also adorn many the freizes. The number of levels at Zvarnots is debated, with some art historians arguing that the cathedral stood an impressive three stories high.

2187,"1 Samuel 2:1-10",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"1 Samuel 2:1-10 is an ancient Hebrew poem contained in the opening narrative of the Samuel-Saul-David narrative cycle in 1-2 Samuel. In 1 Samuel 1, Hannah, a wife of Elkanah the Ephraimite, beseeches Yahweh for a child because she is barren, and Elkanah’s second wife Peninnah “provokes” (*kaʿas) Hannah on this account. In desperation, Hannah prays to Yahweh, asks for a child, and vows to dedicate the boy to Yahweh if he grants her request. Yahweh hears Hannah’s vow, and she conceives a child, the prophet Samuel. Hannah then dedicates Samuel to Yahweh in Shiloh. 1 Samuel 2:1-10 presents the character’s celebration of her god and the narrator explicitly states that “Hannah prayed” (wattitpallēl ḥannâ) the material in 1 Samuel 2:1-10. Based on manuscript and internal evidence, 1 Samuel 2:1-10 was added to the narrative after initial composition, which explains its superficial connection to the preceding narrative. 1 Samuel 2:1-10 is composed in classical Hebrew verse that is intertextually coordinated with other biblical poetry, such as Deuteronomy 32:1-43 and 2 Samuel 22≈Psalm 18 (among others). The poetic lines are written in typical Northwest Semitic two-part (bicola) and three-part (tricola) parallelism. The poem extols Yahweh as the prototypical god, a god of knowledge and wisdom, one who exacts justice and mercy, grants childbirth, controls life, death, and the whole earth. Finally, the poem celebrates Yahweh’s victory over the enemies of his faithful (ḥasîd) and assures that Yahweh gives strength to his (unnamed) king. If the poem of 1 Samuel 2:1-10 circulated independently before being added to 1 Samuel, it could have functioned as a royal victory song during or shortly after the monarchic period (ninth to fifth centuries BCE). In its current context, the poem functions as a literary prayer for the character Hannah that follows the miraculous birth of Samuel.",-900,-500,1795,1564,Taylor Gray,2024-02-15 19:22:36.215 +0100,2024-02-15 19:27:35.650 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World
2189,"Epiphanius of Salamis (Cyprus), ""Panarion""",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Epiphanius was born somewhere between 310 and 320. He was perhaps a Romaniote Jew who was born in the small settlement of Besanduk, near Eleutheropolis, in modern-day Israel. He lived as a monk in Egypt, where he was educated and encountered Valentinian groups. In ca. 333 he returned to Palestine where he founded a monastery nearby, which is often mentioned in the polemics of Jerome with Rufinus and John, Bishop of Jerusalem. He was ordained a priest and quickly became the abbot of the monastery he founded, gaining much skill and knowledge. He was able to speak in several tongues, including Hebrew, Syriac, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin. His reputation for learning prompted his nomination and consecration as Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, somewhere between 365 and 367, a post which he held until his death. Epiphanius is mostly known for his treatise “Panarion” (from the Latin word “panarium”, ""breadbasket""), also known as “Adversus Haereses”. His treatise operates as a book of antidotes for those bitten by the serpent of heresy. Written between 374 and 377, it forms a sort of handbook for dealing with the arguments of heretics. It lists and refutes eighty heresies, some of which are not to be found in any other surviving documents. Epiphanius begins with the “four mothers” of pre-Christian heresy, i.e. “barbarism”, “Scythism” (that is, the Scythian religion, the mythology, ritual practices and beliefs of the Scythian cultures, i.e. ancient Iranic societies who inhabited Central Asia and the Pontic–Caspian steppe in Eastern Europe throughout Classical Antiquity), “Hellenism” (that is, the pagan Greek religion) and “Judaism”. He then addresses sixteen pre-Christian heresies that have flowed from them: four philosophical schools (Stoics, Platonists, Pythagoreans, and Epicureans), and twelve Jewish sects. There then follows an interlude, regarding the Incarnation of the Word. Epiphanius subsequently embarks on his account of the sixty Christian heresies, from miscellaneous Gnostics to the various trinitarian heresies of the fourth century, closing with the Collyridians (an Early Christian movement in Arabia whose adherents apparently worshipped the Virgin Mary as a goddess) and the Messalians. Epiphanius’s treatise is a valuable source of information on the Christian Church of the fourth century. It is also an important source regarding the early Jewish gospels, such as the Gospel according to the Hebrews circulating among the Ebionites and the Nazarenes, as well as the followers of Cerinthus (an early Gnostic) and the Gospel of Merinthus. A unique feature of the “Panarion” is the way that Epiphanius compares the various heretics to different poisonous beasts, going so far as to describe in detail the animal's characteristics, how it produces its poison, and how to protect oneself from the animal's bite or poison. Origen, for example, is described as ""a toad noisy from too much moisture which keeps croaking louder and louder. He compares the Gnostics to a particularly dreaded snake with no fangs. The Ebionites, a Christian sect that followed Jewish law, were described by Epiphanius as a monstrosity with many shapes, who practically formed the snake-like shape of the mythical many-headed Hydra in himself. Epiphanius describes fifty animals, usually one per sect. Furthermore, in the “Panarion” are found some lost works, notably Justin Martyr's work on heresies, the Greek version of Irenaeus's “Against Heresies”, and the “Syntagma” written by Hippolytus.",374,377,2250,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2024-02-16 18:21:07.883 +0100,2024-02-22 18:34:34.693 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

Typically, in these prayers, either an individual or a group confesses their sins to God and petitions the deity to grant forgiveness. The foundational language and theology for these prayers comes from Deuteronomy. However, they also exhibit interactions with a wide variety of other traditions.

2191,Two Aramaic Mortuary Stelae from Nerab,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Nerab 1 (N1) and Nerab 2 (N2) are two seventh century BCE basalt mortuary stelae that were accidently discovered in Nerab, Syria in 1891. Both contain conventional pictorial reliefs and funerary inscriptions (KAI 225 and KAI 226, respectively). N1 shows in relief a solitary male figure standing in profile facing to the right, with his right hand raised in familiar posture of blessing. The inscription identifies this figure as Sin-zer-ibini, priest (kmr) of the moon god Sahar at Nerab. N2 also depicts a priest of the same deity, but the scene is of two figures, one seated at a food-laden table. The figure is identified as Si’gabbar and holds a cup up to his mouth with his right hand. The second (smaller) male figure is unidentified and stands next to the table in a posture of blessing. The first eight lines of N1 wrap around and the other six run across the legs Sin-zer-ibini. In contrast, the inscription of N2 is distinguished from the iconographic relief. The ten-line inscription is incised on the flat surface of the stele above the scene. Both funerary inscriptions are typical of like inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian period in the region. Not least of all because they invoke typical blessing and curse formulae to ensure their graves would not be disturbed. Moreover, they name the deceased and identify them with the “image” (ṣlm). They warn against removing the monument under penalty of divine punishment. Both texts invoke the same deities (Sahar, Nikkal, and Nusku), but N1 also invokes the sun god Shamash. There are other slight differences between the inscriptions that are notable. N1 is written in the third person, whereas N2 is in the first person—Si’gabbar speaks directly to the audience. Moreover, Si’gabbar speaks of his experience of death (and speaks after death!), whereas Sin-zer-ibini does not speak for himself. He simply “is dead” (mt). N1 and N2 are two examples of beliefs about the dead in ancient West Asia. Specifically, how care for the dead could incur blessing and destruction of grave sites could invite divine punishment.",-700,-700,2253,1564,Taylor Gray,2024-02-16 19:15:24.216 +0100,2024-02-27 21:29:02.025 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World

Sobre el cerro que sirve de esqueleto a la pirámide se apilaron grandes rocas alineadas y pulidas, y ladrillos de piedra fina adheridos con mortero, para erigir paredes de orfebrería, monumentales templos de contornos redondeados, cresterías como hojas de palma y techumbres abovedadas más altas y amplias. Grandes explanadas artificiales, unas sobre otras o comunicadas entre sí, sirvieron para edificar sobre ellas los soberbios monumentos que una muralla de 1.70 metros protegió: el Palacio del Gobernador, el Cuadrángulo de las Monjas, Los Pájaros, El Cementerio, El Palomar, el Templo del Adivino, el Templo Sur, la Casa de la Vieja.

“La tres veces construida” se puede traducir también como “Donde se cosecha en abundancia”: los sacerdotes gobernantes, la ideología religiosa de mando y obediencia, llevaba a la mayoría popular a cultivar con ahínco un suelo extraordinariamente fértil, y a colmar los graneros sagrados, los nobiliarios y los comunales, e incluso a transportar muchos productos agrícolas para intercambiar con regiones cercanas y lejanas, junto con las finas vasijas de barro, los tejidos de palma y algodón, la cestería, el amate, la joyería y muchos otros productos preciados. A la vez, traían a la metrópoli bienes de otras latitudes, como la obsidiana de Altiplano Central o la actual Guatemala, o la turquesa del actual sur estadunidense.

2193,Mayapán. La última gran urbe maya.,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"La ciudad de Mayapán estuvo habitado desde la época del nacimiento de Cristo hasta la caída de la ciudad alrededor de 1450 d.C. La evidencia de los periodos son pocas, ningún edificio de la ciudad original ha perdurado, todos fueron demolidos y sus piedras utilizadas en la construcción de nuevos templos y casas. Los datos con los que se cuentan son muy generales. La gente vivió en o alrededor del sitio desde el periodo Clásico Temprano (300-600 d.C.). Por otro lado, la ciudad amurallada de Mayapán, fundada en el siglo XIII, fue el centro más importante de la civilización maya durante el periodo Postclásico (1250-1450 d.C.), es decir, hasta poco antes de la llegada de los españoles. Esta gran capital maya ejerció su dominio sobre las provincias de la parte noroeste y centro-norte de la península de Yucatán. Mayapán parece haber sido un centro de población importante. Su grandeza está plasmada en sus edificios de grandes volúmenes y densa concentración. Alrededor de 1560, Fray Diego de Landa menciona que la tradición local indicaba que Mayapán fue fundada por Kukulcán, quien reinó durante un tiempo y después partió hacia el centro de México. Posteriormente los principales dirigentes decidieron formar un gobierno conjunto bajo la dirección de la familia Cocom, por ser los más ricos y los de más antiguo linaje. Hacia mitad del siglo XV esta capital fue destruida y quemada, los dirigentes regresaron a sus provincias dejando abandonada a la ciudad de Mayapán. En las características constructivas de las edificaciones es evidente la fuerte influencia que tuvo Chichén Itzá y algunas características postclásicas del Altiplano Mexicano. El edificio principal de Mayapán, conocido como “el Castillo de Kukulcán”, fue construido con menores dimensiones imitando al de Chichén Itzá del mismo nombre.",300,1450,2255,1559,Orlando Casares Contreras,2024-02-17 00:10:05.275 +0100,2024-02-17 00:10:56.014 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2194,The Redeemed Christian Church of God,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) was founded in Nigeria in 1952 by Josiah Olufemi Akindayomi.  The church has a rich history and a profound impact on the global Christian landscape. 
Akindayomi was born in Ondo, Southwestern Nigeria, in 1909.  Although he was born into a family that followed indigenous religions, he later joined the Anglican Church, where he was baptized in 1927.  His religious desire made him move further to the Cherubim and Seraphim Church (C & S) in 1931.  He founded a prayer group within the C&S, which he called Egbe Ogo Oluwa (The Glory of God Fellowship) in 1947.  It was this group that metamorphosed into the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in 1952.  According to Ogunewu, Akindayomi made several prophetic declarations about the RCCG that have come to fruition. He predicted that the church would spread to all nations of the world and that it would be characterized by mighty miracles and wonders. Akindayomi also foresaw that the RCCG would be at the forefront of a Pentecostal explosion on the African continent. His commitment to prayer, evangelism, and spiritual growth laid the foundation for the church’s remarkable growth and influence. By the time of his death in 1980, RCCG had about 40 parishes within Nigeria.
Enoch Adejare Adeboye succeeded Akindayomi as the General Overseer in 1981.  Before this appointment, he served as the founder’s interpreter, demonstrating his close relationship with the church’s origins.  Born on March 2, 1942, in Ifewara, Osun State, Nigeria, Adeboye hails from a very humble family. He often shares the story of wearing his first shoes at the age of 18.  Adeboye went to Ilesha Grammar School in Osun State and started to study mathematics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.  Due to the Nigerian Civil War, he completed his first degree in mathematics at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1967.  His academic pursuits continued with a Master’s degree in hydrodynamics from the University of Lagos and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the same institution.  Adeboye joined the RCCG in 1973 and initially served as an interpreter. In 1975, he was ordained as a pastor by Pa. Josiah Akindayomi.  By 1981, he had become the General Overseer, leading the church’s expansion.  The RCCG, which had 40 parishes in Nigeria at the time of his appointment, has now grown to about 198 nations worldwide, with over 9 million worshipers in Nigeria alone.  He is considered a preacher of the holiness movement and emphasizes Christian discipleship through local churches. Adeboye’s global impact extends beyond Africa, with a great following for the church through various Christian ministries and social efforts  Adeboye’s vision includes establishing RCCG branches within walking or driving distance in cities, ensuring accessibility for worshipers.
The church emphasizes holiness, discipleship, and obedience to God’s Word. RCCG’s impact extends beyond Africa, touching lives through ministries and social efforts. In 1990, the RCCG Bible School was founded, nurturing leaders and ministers. The Redemption Camp in Mowe, Lagos, was purchased in 1983, serving as a hub for conferences, retreats, and worship. The Redeemed Christian Fellowship (RCF) for students was established in 1988, fostering spiritual growth among young believers.  The church’s headquarters, now at 1-5 Redemption Way, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, symbolizes its journey from humble beginnings to global prominence.",1952,2023,2256,1525,Olusegun Olawoyin,2024-02-17 04:12:52.372 +0100,2024-03-04 18:55:05.728 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2195,Church of the Holy Apostles,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Palaeologan church dedicated to the Holy Apostles in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, dates around the late 13th and early 14th century. It is located in the western part of the historic centre of Thessaloniki, near the west wall and the Litaia Gate, which does not exist any longer. It is likely that the church was the katholikon (the main church) of an unidentified monastery and that it was likely dedicated to the Mother of God, probably that of Theotokos Gorgoepikoos. This hypothesis was based on the depiction of the second founder, Paul, who was a former disciple of Patriarch Niphon I and also the abbot of the monastery, depicted praying before the enthroned Virgin. The scene is located above the entrance leading from the narthex to the nave, along with scenes from the Life of the Virgin in the ambulatory. Surviving structures in the vicinity of the church include part of the once imposing tower‑shaped portal with a large barrel-vaulted passage to the south-west, and a large cistern to the north-west, the size of which attests to the large number of monks living there, as well as the monastery’s wealth. According to tradition, the church has taken its current name from the popular belief that it had a twelve-domed roof symbolizing the Apostles.
The katholikon was constructed between 1310 and 1314 by Patriarch Niphon I, as attested by the inscription on the marble lintel above the main entrance; the monograms on the capitals of the west facade and the monograms on bricks. A painted inscription over the entrance to the naos mentions also Patriarch Niphon and his disciple Paul, as founders of the monastery. Based on dendrochronological data, the monument was dated to or just after 1329. It was originally suggested that the naos and the narthex are earlier and that Niphon added later the ambulatory and restored it. Current research suggests that the whole building dates to the same period and that it may have been left unfinished when Niphon was expelled from office in 1314, and that it was completed later.
The Holy Apostles is a cross-in-square church with a tripartite sanctuary and a narthex. The ambulatory consists of longitudinal parekklesia connecting with the outer narthex (exonarthex) to the west. The main dome is surrounded by four smaller domes in the ambulatory, with two domes on its eastern ends and a second pair of domes flanking the narthex. The domed chapels on the eastern ends communicate directly with the tripartite sanctuary. Between the domes of each parekklesion are two bays with a single groin vault and a single domical vault. The southern chapel originally had a door, which was at a point walled up. The church has a U-shaped ambulatory enveloping the naos and the narthex. The exterior is lavishly decorated with ornamental brickwork, typical of Palaeologan monuments. The interior is decorated with mosaics sponsored by Patriarch Niphon. The Pantocrator is depicted in the central dome, surrounded by ten Prophets. The four Evangelists are depicted alongside scenes from the Dodekaorton: Nativity, Transfiguration, Entry into Jerusalem, Resurrection, Crucifixion and  Assumption. With the mosaics of the Monasteries of Chora and Pammakaristos in Constantinople, those of the Holy Apostles of Thessaloniki are the latest examples of similar decoration in Byzantium, considered among the finest of Palaeologan art. Frescoes of equally high quality were painted in the lower parts of the nave, the narthex, the peristyle and the north chapel, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, bearing scenes from the Old and New Testaments, and subjects either inspired by hymnography or of symbolic nature. The wall paintings date to the late 1410s,  and have been linked to the abbacy of Paul, the second founder of the Monastery.
Perhaps around 1455 or 1520 the Ottomans converted the church into a mosque. A minaret was added to the south-west corner of the monument and a wooden porch was erected to its northern and western sides. It became a church in 1912 when Greeks took control of the city. Restoration took place between 1926-1928 and 1940-1942, which included the removal of the Ottoman plasters covering the interior decoration. Consolidation works were carried out after the earthquake of 1978. In 2002 the mosaics were cleaned. The monument was inscribed in the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites.",1310,2024,2257,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-02-17 16:13:27.571 +0100,2024-02-17 20:28:23.281 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2196,Balaam Inscription from Tell Deir ‘Allā,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Tell Deir ʿAllā inscription, also known as the Balaam inscription, describes a series of ink on plaster fragments which survive from the site Deir ʿAllā in the Valley of Succoth in ancient Gilead (modern Jordan). The plaster text was originally displayed on the inner walls of a building that was subsequently destroyed by an earthquake. Discovered by H. Franken in 1967 and later published by J. Hoftijzer and G. van der Kooij in 1976, scholars piece together the fragments into two combinations (see esp. the editio princeps by Hoftijzer and van der Kooij 1976 as well as Caquot and Lemaire 1977; Hackett 1980). The text was originally dated to the Persian period (Franken 1967), but the date was quickly refined on paleographic grounds to the mid-8th century or earlier (already Naveh 1967; Cross 1969). While the script can be classified as Aramaic, the dialect has been much disputed in previous scholarship. The options include Aramaic (Hoftijzer and van der Kooij 1976), Canaanite (Hacket 1980; 1984; Rendsburg 1992; Pat-El and Wilson-Wright 2015), a local dialect (McCarter 1991), or a separate branch of Northwest Semitic (Huehnergard 1991). Regardless of its technical linguistic classification, some scholars employ the term “Gileadite” on the basis of its distinct local character (Kaufman 1988; Greenfield 1991; Rendsburg 1992).

Since its discovery, the Deir ʿAllā inscription has piqued scholarly interest because the inscription mentions a certain “Balaam son of Beor” (בלעם בר בער) who appears also in the biblical book of Numbers and subsequent biblical and Jewish tradition. According to Num 22-24, Balaam (called בִּלְעָם בֶּן־בְּעוֹר ‘Bilʿām son of Bəʿōr’) was a non-Israelite diviner from Pethor who was hired by the Moabite king Balaq son of Ṣippor to curse Israel but instead blesses them in four separate discourses (מָשָׁל) according to the word of the Lord. The Deir ʿAllā inscription confirms the biblical tradition that Balaam was a diviner as it calls him “a seer of the gods” (חזה אלהן) and recounts a nocturnal theophany which he received “according to the utterance of El” (כמשא אל). However, although it contains parallels with the biblical traditions about Balaam, the Deir ʿAllā text is not itself an extrabiblical portrayal of the biblical narrative.

Combination I describes the report of Balaam’s nocturnal vision which he received from the gods (אלהן) at the behest of El (אל), a Semitic word meaning “god” but also a well-known deity in the ancient Near East, especially among Levantine religions such as in ancient Israel, Phoenicia, and Ugarit. Distraught from the contents of the theophany (lines 1-4), Balaam fasts and weeps, then recounts the vision to his companions. He tells them about the “council” (מועד) of the “Shaddai-gods” (שדין = šaddāyîn), a word undoubtedly related to the Hebrew theonym El-Shaddai (אֵל שַׁדַּי). Although its etymology is debated, the negative portrayal of the Shaddai-gods in the Deir ʿAllā inscription suggests the possibility of associating it with a Northwest Semitic word for “demons” (Heb. שֵׁדִים, Aram. שֵׁידִין‏; cf. Akk. šēdu) and/or a verb meaning “to destroy” (√šdd). Another widely accepted alternative for El-Shaddai, however, is to understand the element šad(d)ay as meaning “mountain, wilderness,” thus rendering “God of the Mountain/Wilderness” (Delitzsch 1896; Albright 1968; Cross 1973; Knauf 1999). Regardless of the correct etymology, the biblical tradition (Num. 24:4, 16) situates Shaddai (often translated as “the Almighty”) as the source of Balaam’s theophany rather than its subject matter. In the Deir ʿAllā inscription, the Shaddai-gods have commissioned a deity called Šagar-wa-Ištar to sew up and block out the heavens (line 6) which in turn creates darkness and chaos on earth. Interpretations of the second half of the first combination diverge significantly, but according to one interpretation, incantations were used to ward off the impending doom and thus the land is saved (Levine, COS 2.27). The contents of Combination II and its relationship to the first combination are much less certain given its highly fragmentary state, but it seems to have something to do with El’s construction of a necropolis and/or the netherworld, called the “house of eternity” (בית עלמן). Moreover, Balaam’s name does not appear in Combination II.

In conclusion, the Deir ʿAllā inscription is ultimately our best example of a (semi-)mythological text from the Iron Age Transjordan. While scholars continue to debate aspects of its linguistic classification and interpretation, there can be no doubt that it serves as an important source for reconstructing the history of religion in the ancient Levant.",-850,-750,1368,1379,Matthew Saunders,2024-02-17 18:33:03.964 +0100,2024-02-17 22:48:16.048 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2197,Bab edh-Dhra,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Bab edh-DhraꜤ is an archaeological site located in Jordan, notable for its over 20,000 burials and large influential settlement traditionally associated with the Biblical town of Sodom. While the site does have evidence of occupation dating back as early as the Paleolithic, Neolithic and Chalcolithic Periods, the Early Bronze Age remains are most informative for Near Eastern History because they exemplify shifts in ancient burial customs, the initial drive toward urbanism and the inherent early struggles associated with transitioning to a sedentary lifestyle. 
Bab edh-DhraꜤ, located in Transjordan along the southeastern section of the Dead Sea about 240 m below sea level, is bound by the Wadi Kerak, which served as a fresh water source as well as a defensible cliff protecting the town’s inhabitants. Surveys of the region beginning in the 1920s identified Bab edh-DhraꜤ as a noteworthy site which led to excavations commencing in the 1960s led by Paul W. Lapp, and subsequent expeditions continued through the 1970s and 1980s. Excavations of the Early Bronze Age revealed that early on burials dominated the landscape, and later on the site was the location of a large fortified town. 
The Early Bronze Age IA tombs at Bab edh-DhraꜤ provide key insights into ancient burial practices and beliefs about the dead. Over 60 Early Bronze Age IA shaft tombs have been investigated, most comprising of multiple chambers often circular in shape and each covered by a domed or flat roof. Each chamber held piles of disarticulated bones from multiple individuals with skulls lining the side of the tomb. The chambers also included several ceramic vessels with slash or incised design, and some additional grave goods such as stone bowls, clay figurines, mace heads, and jewelry. Round mudbrick burial houses containing remains of multiple individuals were introduced later on during the EB IB, and a small settlement also arose at the site during this time. Following a brief period of possible destruction and abandonment, the EB II Period site saw a population increase and the town exhibited features such as large public buildings, a silo and an enclosure wall. The EB II population continued the burial practices of the EB I and constructed more funerary buildings that housed primary and secondary burials as well as pottery and other artifacts.  
While the burial practices are most noted in the earlier parts of the Early Bronze Age, the focal point later becomes the urban development characteristic of the Early Bronze Age III in the region. The population at the site continued to increase and the site was fortified with a 7m-wide mudbrick wall with a stone foundation that encompassed nine acres of occupation that could have housed around 1,000 people. Within the walls there were domestic quarters, monumental buildings and a “sanctuary” in the southern part of the town that contained a courtyard with a stone altar and tools most likely used for butchering animals. Evidence for occupation was also found outside the city walls and remnants of barley, wheat, and sheep and goat bones were uncovered in excavations. During this time period, the dead were placed in rectangular mudbrick burial buildings, called Charnel Houses, and accompanied by pottery, figurines, and other objects. 
The end of the early Bronze Age saw an abandonment and deterioration of the large EB III town. Occupation shifted to the countryside surrounding the former town and a ceremonial area containing an altar and animal horns sat within the ruins. The abandonment of the city and preference for rural occupation is a trend seen throughout the region at the end of the Early Bronze Age. 
While we do not know the ancient name of the site, the ruins have traditionally been linked to the biblical site of Sodom and the story of its demise found in Genesis 19 based on its location and evidence of conflagration. However, this theory has been contested mainly because of the questionable historicity of the story and the occupation dates to an earlier time than the bible story would have taken place. Some have argued that the biblical story could have been formulated to explain the ancient ruins of the city visible along the Dead Sea. 
Preservation of the site and proper documentation of the finds, especially from the tombs, is hindered by the extensive looting that has taken place at Bab edh-DhraꜤ for over a century. Many of the site’s artifacts have entered the illegal antiquities market. The local government and archaeologists are working to document the artifacts, enact measures to protect the site and recover the stolen objects of this important Early Bronze Age site. Artifacts from the burials can also be found in museums throughout the world, thus providing access for many people interested in understanding ancient burial practices. The ancient site of Bab edh-DhraꜤ continues to provide key insights into our understanding of ancient burial practices and shifts toward early urbanism as archaeologists work to study, protect, and preserve the culturally valuable material from the site.",-3300,-2000,2258,1104,Heidi Fessler,2024-02-18 00:57:31.955 +0100,2024-02-18 01:46:25.197 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2198,Katumuwa Stele from Sam'al,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Katumuwa Stele is a monumental funerary effigy from the eighth century BCE that was commissioned by a royal official named Katumuwa (or possibly Kuttamuwa) from the Aramean kingdom of Samʾal (also called Yaʾdiya). It was discovered in July of 2008 during the Oriential Institute’s Neubeauer Expedition in Zincirli, Turkey and subsequently published the following year (Pardee 2009 [editio princeps]). Zincirli (ancient Samʾal/Yaʾdiya), a 40-hectare ruin mound (Turkish höyük, Arabic tell), served as the capital city of the Iron Age kingdom of Samʾal (fl. 900-713 BCE) and afterward as a province of the Neo-Assyrian empire. The large basalt stele was discovered in Building A/II of Complex A in the northern lower town of the site, namely Katumuwa’s mortuary chapel, although it probably was originally a domestic residence. It’s possible that the adjacent room, called by the excavators Building A/III, was a small neighborhood temple to one of the gods mentioned in the inscription, which itself comports with other evidence for a royal mortuary cult at Samʾal. In fact, veneration of the spirits of the royal and ancestral dead, especially feasts for the dead, is widely known from ancient Mesopotamia and the Levant (see e.g. Lewis 2014). The Katumuwa Stele, however, is unique in that it’s the best preserved mortuary stele that combines both a banquet scene as well as an inscription from the first-person perspective of the beneficiary. The introduction states: “I am Katumuwa, servant of Panamuwa, who commissioned for myself (this) stele while still living. I placed it in my eternal chamber and established a feast (at) this chamber” (Pardee 2014). The inscription proceeds to outline the instructions for the feast wherein a bull and five rams are sacrificed for the following five deities as well as Katumuwa’s post-mortem “essence” (נבש, often translated “soul”) that is in the stele itself: Hadad-Qarpatalli (one bull), NGD/R-ṢWD/RN (one ram), Šamš (one ram), Hadad-of-the-Vineyards (one ram), Kubaba (one ram), and Katumuwa (one ram). The second half of the inscription then provides further instructions for whomever comes into possession of the chamber, namely that he should perform the yearly offering “from the best (produce) of this vineyard” in addition to the slaughter prescribed above. The stele’s banquet scene also provides a source of valuable information for understanding how Katumuwa feasts in the afterlife. Katumuwa is depicted as sitting in a chair with his feet resting on a footstool. A table sits in front of him arrayed with food, specifically bread, meat (a duck?), and a container with some sort of spices or aromatics. In his hands are a drinking bowl (right) and a conifer cone on a branch (left). Finally, the winged sun-disk tops the stele representing the protection of Šamš. Importantly, this mortuary banquet scene shares a number of iconographic parallels with similar banquet scenes from Zincirli and elsewhere in Syro-Hittite art, e.g. the Aramaic-inscribed Neirab Stele of the priest Si-Gabbar. As such, the Katumuwa Stele stands as a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the ancient kingdom of Samʾal and provides an important window into the religious beliefs and cultic practices of its inhabitants.",-900,-700,1333,1379,Matthew Saunders,2024-02-18 05:04:11.839 +0100,2024-02-24 04:27:20.976 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2199,"Prayer for Vengeance against Mariam, Kallinikos, and Others",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A prayer to the Christian God and his subordinate powers to avenge a woman against a long list of enemies who are implied to have wronged her. This text is one of a number of curses of this type in Coptic and Greek from Christian Egypt from between the fourth and ninth centuries CE, which are distinct from many contemporary curses in presenting themselves as petitions (libellus) to redress past wrongs. This text would have been folded and deposed in a significant site, although the lack of surviving archaeological context leaves this context uncertain; it may have been a grave or shrine. The targets of the curse include twenty named individuals (11 female and 9 male), as well as a number of others identified by other means (such as “the son of the cumin-seller”). It addresses the ‘Lord God’ as well as various subordinate angelic beings (the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Suriel, one of the seraphim of the divine presence), the prophet Daniel, and two personified figures — the place in which the text was deposed, and the Lord’s Birthday (Christmas day, perhaps the date of the text’s deposition). These figures are called to “avenge” the petitioner, and “strike” (apatasse) the targets, presumably with sickness, death, or other misfortunes. Before deposition, the text was folded numerous times to produce a small package; from other texts we know that it was believed that the curse could be undone by unfolding and reading it again.",401,500,136,1577,Korshi Dosoo,2024-02-20 13:07:27.595 +0100,2024-02-22 20:09:36.268 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World
2200,The Roman Catholic Mission in Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Roman Catholic Church in Nigeria is part of the universal Roman Catholic Church under the authority of the Pope. The Roman Catholic Mission (RCM) in Nigeria is more prevalent in the southern part of the country than the north. The Pope has a representative called the Nuncio (ambassador) in Nigeria. The local church in Nigeria is governed by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) in conjunction with the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) as the highest administrative body for decision making for the Catholic Church in Nigeria (CBCN). The Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) has her headquarter in Abuja. The current president of the CBCN is Lucius Iwejuru Ugorji (2022), the Archbishop of Owerri Archdiocese. The president of this body is by rotation. The Roman Catholic Mission in Nigeria is hierarchically structured; the Cardinals, Archbishops, bishops, Reverend Fathers, Religious, Reverend Deacons, Sisters, Seminarians and the lay faithfuls.
The Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal were the first set of Missionaries that visited Nigeria. They first came to the present amalgamated Nigeria, through the Benin River and made contact with the Itsekiris during the fifteenth century. Warri was probably the first place they visited but without success. The subsequent enthusiastic Society of African Mission (SMA) was sent by Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith from Rome after the failure of Lisbon and Spanish Capuchin in 1856. The nineteenth century also witnessed the coming of the Holy Ghost Fathers (CCSP) into the country. The SMA went to the Western part of the country while the (CCSP) went to the Eastern part of the country.
Because a significant group of European missionaries gained access to Nigeria through the Badagry port, the town became the historic entry point of Christianity in the country. Rev. Fr. Borghero brought the Catholic faith to Yorubaland. This was done by the pastoral initiative of Melchoir Joseph De Marion Bresillac from France, who founded the SMA with the aim of evangelizing Africa. As early as 1860s a catechist named “Padre Antonio” was in charge of a nuclear Catholic family that existed in Lagos. The 1868 advent of the SMA marked the arrival of Francesco Borghero to Lagos. The work of evangelization started from Lagos and spread to other areas which are covered today by five provinces: Lagos, Benin, Ibadan, Jos and Kaduna.
The Holy Ghost Fathers (Spiritans) arrived Onitsha in December, 1885 led by Fr. Lutz.  They preferred raising Christian communities and did not put much emphasis on education. The initial evangelization in the lower Niger consisted of buying black slaves, giving them medical care, and bringing them up in a Christian community.
Although attempts were made by the Catholic church to establish their presence in the north in 17th/18th century in Gobir (Sokoto) and Bornu. Around this time, the Kingdom of Kororofa was said to have had nearly 100,000 Christians and a sixty-bed hospital built by a priest. 
 The encounter with Islamic religion in the Niger Benue confluence foreshadowed what problem would later bedevil evangelization and the relationship between Christianity and Islam. As happened with the Protestant mission, the move to the north was halted by British order. However, in 1907 the intrepid Zappa was able to make the 300-mile leap from Asaba to establish the only Catholic station in the north. This was in Shendam in present day Plateau State. The parish remained the only Catholic mission station in Northern Nigeria up to the 1930s. The evangelization of northern Nigeria was very difficult because of the colonial ambitions in the north.  One of the problems was “the Lugard exclusion” which forbade missionaries from preaching to Moslems. 
The pastoral activities of the church in Nigeria today embraces a number of directorates manned by the Clergy, Religious and the Lay Faithful for the spiritual, pastoral and social growth of the Country. Each of the directorate is also an agency for the continued evangelisation in Nigeria. They are: The Family Ministries, Marriage Tribunal, the Directorate of Religious Education, Biblical Apostolate, Catechetical Institute, Communication, Health, Justice, Development and Peace Commission, Judicial Commission, Prisons, Vocations, Liturgy, Music, Pontifical Mission Society, etc.  All these Commissions provide social services to the general public without discrimination. They are means by which the CBCN uses to communicates her voice to all and sundry especially to the Nigeria government.",1480,2024,1082,1568,Joseph Ajayi,2024-02-20 13:28:08.473 +0100,2024-03-29 17:53:43.471 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2201,Panagia tou Bryoni,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of the Panagia tou Bryoni is situated 6 km southeast of Arta, near the village of Neochoraki. The name Bryoni (Μπρυώνη) probably indicates that the church was named after someone called Βρυώνης (Vryonis). This Vryonis may have been the founder or the renovator of this church. The family name Βρυώνης was known among the elite of the Despotate of Epiros. Some scholars argue that the name of the church came from the corrupted version of the word “περιώνυμος” ((enowned). The church was a katholikon of a monastery. A brick inscription on the exterior façade of the church explains that the katholikon was a stauropegial (patriarchal-established) monastery, consecrated by Patriarch Germanos II (1222-1240). Based on this inscription, scholars date the church to 1238, as sources acknowledge that Patriarch Germanos II visited Arta during that year. The full inscription as provided by Papadopoulou, reads: Στα(υ)ρωπίγιο(ν) πατριαρχηκὸν τὸ ἁγι(α)σθὲν παρὰ Γερμανοῦ καὶ οἰκο[υμενικοῦ πατριάρχου] (Stavropegion patriarchal consecrated by Germanos, ecumenical patriarch) (Papadopoulou 2002; Fundic 2022).

 The church is a three-aisled basilica (two columns divide the church into three aisles) with an octagonal dome that has a single-lobed window on each side.  Its current form is from the renovations that took place between 1867 and 1871.  The apse is to the east and originally it had three windows. Above the arch and in the pediment of the east side there is a small single-lobed window surrounded by a double brick band and a dog-tooth frieze. The exterior bears the brickwork decoration of dog-tooth friezes and zigzags, common ornamentation in Epirotic churches. However, the brick decoration features several differences from that of Panagia Pantanassa in Philippiada and Kato Panagia near Arta, which hints at the various artistic tendencies that prevailed in the Despotate as well as to the employment of a local workshop. The exterior decoration is mainly on the eastern façade and the two side pediments. There is a brick cross on the exterior that was probably added in the renovation work in the 19th century. Plaster decoration is also used for the exterior. Scholars argue that the plaster immured on the wall formed part of the templon (north pediment). Regarding the interior decoration, and based on the evidence available today, the church originally did not bear any decoration. In 1873, it was painted by the artist Athanasios from Samarina.",1238,2024,2259,1487,Sofia Pitouli,2024-02-20 16:09:31.151 +0100,2024-02-20 16:21:34.054 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2203,Huang-Lao Daoism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Huang-Lao Daoism 黄老道 was the dominant tradition of Daoism throughout the Han Dynasty. Although concrete historical records that would allow us to clearly document its origins are less than concrete, its first and formative phase began in the middle period of the Warring States, as evidenced in the earliest of its known writings, including the excavated texts Hengxian 恒先 and Fanwu liuxing 凡物流形 that are dated to that time. These texts reveal that the tradition was inspired by the philosophy of the Daodejing 道德經, commonly attributed to the ancient sage Laozi 老子; it represents the foundational text of Daoism that had already been in circulation from at least the early Warring States and that is identified with an earlier tradition of Daoism sometimes called Yangsheng Daoism 飬生道. As demonstrated by these excavated Huang-Lao texts, the burgeoning Huang-Lao tradition had appropriated Laozi’s earlier version of the Daodejing that is reflected in the excavated Guodian Laozi 郭店老子 together with its philosophical thought and altered it in significant ways to make it conform to their own different perspectives, primarily concerning cosmology and government. Whereas the core features of Laozi’s original Daodejing centered on a phenomenology of the Dao, the figure of the sage, and the cultivational practice of yangsheng 飬生 (“feeding life”), the core features of the Huang-Lao version of the text centered on a metaphysics of the Dao, the mysticism of the sage-ruler, and the practice of mental concentration often called zuowang 坐忘 (“sit and forget”) that was championed by other texts of the period, namely the Neiye 内業 and the Zhuangzi 莊子. Huang-Lao thought thus emphasized a hierarchical vision of the cosmos in conjunction with an autocratic vision of ideal government in the hands of the enlightened sage-ruler who enjoyed a privileged relationship with the Dao. The second phase of Huang-Lao spans from the last period of the Warring States to the end of the Qin Dynasty, during which the tradition developed to such an extent that their thought was given ample recognition next to Confucianism, Legalism, and the other major schools of early Chinese philosophical debate in the major philosophical compendiums of the period, namely the Lüshi Chunqiu 吕氏春秋 and the Guanzi 管子. This second period also has provided us with two landmark Huang-Lao writings, namely the excavated Mawangdui Laozi 馬王堆老子, representing the first known complete editions of the Daodejing, albeit in their own Huang-Lao version that superseded Laozi’s earlier Yangsheng version, at least for the lettered classes, as well as the Huangdi sijing 黄帝四經, the first collection of writings that reveal Huang-Lao thought in its full development. The third phase of Huang-Lao spans from the beginning of the Han Dynasty to the reign of Han Emperor Wu 漢武帝 (r. 141- 87BC). It was during this period that Huang-Lao enjoyed a dominant position in state ideology and the administration of government policy, in no small part due to its embrace by the a number of high-ranking officials, including Cao Shen 曹參  (d. 190 BCE) and his successor Chen Ping 陳平  (d. 178 BCE), as well as by the Han Emperors Wen 漢文帝 (r. 180 to 157 BC) and Jing 漢景帝 (r. 157 to 141 BC), whose commitment to Huang-Lao was strongly supported by Empress Dowager Dou 竇皇後 (d. 135 BC), wife of the former and mother of the latter. This period also saw the completion of the most sophisticated writings of the Huang-Lao tradition, including the Wenzi 文字, Heguanzi 鹖冠子, and Huainanzi 淮南子. This period came to a dramatic close with the death of Liu An 劉安, the Prince of Huainan (who was responsible for the Huainanzi), in 122 BC at the hands of Emperor Wu, who banished Huang-Lao from the court and replaced it with Confucian ideology and government policy. The final phase of Huang-Lao, from the middle of the Western Han to the end of the Eastern Han or shortly thereafter, is marked by the distance of its adherents from the centers of imperial power together with their desire to have Huang-Lao reinstated therein. This phase first comes to light with the semi-hermit Yan Zun 嚴遵 (fl. 83 B.C.E.–10 C.E.) and his complete edition of the Daodejing with an appended commentary, Laozi Zhigui 老子指歸, which lays out the full panoply of Huang-Lao cosmological and political concerns by way of his commentary to the text. His work was soon followed by another Huang-Lao edition of and appended commentary to the Daodejing, Heshang Gong’s Commentary to the Laozi 老子河上公章句, composed by an anonymous Huang-Lao scholar under the pseudonym of Heshang Gong 河上公; it was this work that served as the basic text that would become known to us as the received edition. Next to its Huang-Lao cosmology and political philosophy, another noteworthy feature of Heshang Gong’s text is its prominent emphasis on popular religious practices that were believed to lead to immortality, which were sometimes identified with yangsheng practice, showing that, in this final stage of Huang-Lao Daoism, it led the way into the immortality practices of future movements of religious Daoism. Many of these trends can be seen in the biographies of Eastern Han personages, including those found in Han shu 漢書, Qian Han shu 前漢書, and Hou Han shu 後漢書, which commonly introduce their subjects as “loving Huang-Lao” 爱黄老, “cultivating Huang-Lao” 修黄老, and “practicing Huang-Lao techniques” 學黄老術. Already by the time of the Wei-Jin Dynasty, Huang-Lao had been displaced as the dominant Daoist tradition by Xuanxue Daoism 玄學道, with its philosophical appeal to the literati class, as well as by Tianshi Daoism 天師道, with its practical appeal to the popular masses.",-476,220,501,1574,Thomas Michael,2024-02-22 01:40:30.256 +0100,2024-03-04 19:08:10.717 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2204,Alahan,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Alahan complex is located above the Göksu river valley within the Taurus mountain range, at an elevation of approximately 1200 meters above sea level, 900 meters above the Göksu river valley, and 300 meters above the modern road traveling from Karaman and Mut. The complex itself is situated narrowly on a shelf on the mountainside and likely dates to the fifth century. It was attributed to the reign of emperor Zeno by Michael Gough, however, this has since been strongly contested by Hugh Elton. Its overall function has also been contested, which some calling it a monastic compound and others arguing it served primarily as a place of pilgrimage. Structurally, the site is comprised of a number of buildings, including two basilicas (the East Church and the Church of the Evangelist), a multi-phased baptistery, a rock-cut cave church, a small cemetery, and an unfinished colonnaded walkway, spanning approximately 30X200 meters in total. A number of other subsidiary structures, including the use of nearby cave cells for monks’ lodgings have been recorded. All buildings at the site of Alahan are quarried from local limestone ashlar and several buildings feature simplistic sculptural reliefs. The Church of the Evangelists, sometimes referred to as the West Church, is in almost complete ruin. The church was named for decoration which references the Evangelists at its gate, but it is unclear to whom the church was dedicated in its day. The church was once lavishly decorated with sculpted masonry and mosaics, unusual for rural churches of the area. The East church, while better preserved is simpler in its design and decoration. The baptistry complex features a two-aisled floorplan with painted decoration and a cruciform baptismal font and connects to the colonnaded walkway.",400,2024,2264,1554,Aurora Camaño,2024-02-22 01:44:41.264 +0100,2024-02-22 01:44:41.264 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The closet modern village to the site today is İçel. With It is located at an elevation of 1,000 meters above the valley, and a few hundred meters above the same main road which connects Alahan from Karaman to Mut. The rock cut cave church is largely carved out of the natural limestone. Likely dating to the first iconoclastic period, Al Oda’s most attention drawing feature is the surviving artwork within the complex, which includes lime plaster tempera frescos and mosaics. The wallpaintings and are described as “non-representational, yet recognizably Christian” by Michael Gough who recorded the site in the 1950s. The floor mosaics were also non-representational, leading to the belief that Al Oda was built during the iconoclast period. Structurally, the main feature of the complex is the rock-cut church which is also known as the Red Room.

2206,Cennet ve Cehennem,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Cennet ve Cehennem, translated to Heaven and Hell, is a cave site associated with two early Byzantine churches in the modern province of Mersin, Turkey. The caves are located 1 kilometer from the coast of Southern Turkey, twenty minutes east of modern day Silifke, and a mere 5 kilometers west of Corycus. The Cave site is also as the holding place of Typhon in Greek mythology. The site comprises of a number of structural features: the two natural caves, the temple-church, and the Chapel of St. Mary. The temple-church, prior to its Christian conversion was originally built for worshipping of Zeus. It is located just outside of the cave entrance and was later converted into a Christian Basilica in the late Roman period. Exact dates of conversion are unknown as dedicatory inscriptions were removed in the late 1800s by Theodore James Bent and subsequently lost. The temple-church which measures 39X23 meters, encompasses several distinct masonry styles, indicating a multi-phased building history. The single naved Chapel dedicated to St. Mary by an individual named Paulus was constructed deep within the cave itself; and it is suspected that because of the overhanging rock shelter the structure was never roofed. It is approximately 12.4x6.7 in size. Although the date is unknown, it has been suspected to have a fifth century date. Additionally, a staircase of 288 steps was laid to reach the church of the Virgin within the Cennet cave. The second cave, Cehennem (the Hell Cave), does not feature any ecclesiastical remains and is significantly deeper.",400,2024,2265,1554,Aurora Camaño,2024-02-22 07:23:40.891 +0100,2024-02-22 07:23:40.891 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2207,Synagogue at Magdala,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"A 1st century CE synagogue structure discovered in 2009 at Magdala (Al-Majdal) under the auspices of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Universidad Anáhuac México Sur. This structure is well decorated and notable for the discovery of a figural stone block within, itself featuring one of the earliest depictions of a menorah. It has at least three rooms, the largest of which is a square hall lined featuring columns and lined with benches. A side room is also lined with benches and has been suggested to have functioned as a study room or bet midrash.

Magdala lies on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, north of Tiberias, and was settled perhaps in the early 2nd century BCE. The town itself was a large settlement by the middle of the 1st century CE. The site boasts archaeological finds from a lavish bathhouse, to quayside, marketplace and richly decorated domiciles.  It also features as a prominent town of Galilee in the writings of Josephus. Here under the name Taricheae (with some debate over this identification), Josephus describes the inhabitants are being largely on the side of the Jewish rebels against Rome.",1,80,2266,1247,Joseph Scales,2024-02-22 11:47:59.239 +0100,2024-02-27 08:39:52.208 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2208,The Book of Judith,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Book of Judith is an ancient Jewish work which details the resistance of Judith, a pious widow, who assassinates an Assyrian general besieging her town. The work narrates the attempted invasion of Judea by Holofernes, and the heroism of Judith, who prevents the destruction of the people and the Jerusalem Temple through her faithfulness, but also her cunning and leadership. The work is often described as being of two halves; the first seven chapters cover the conquests of the Assyrian army and introduce the character of Achior, while chapters eight to sixteen narrate Judith’s infiltration of the Assyrian camp, successfully assassinating Holofernes and breaking the siege of her hometown Bethulia. 

The work is commonly part of the Christian canon, although at least since Jerome, it was not considered on a par with the core of the Hebrew Bible and was attributed a so-called “deuterocanonical” status. The work appears to have limited impact amongst early Jewish readers; there are some references to Judith in rabbinic sources, mostly clustered around particular associations between Judith and Hannukah. 

The work was likely composed around the beginning of the 1st century BCE, although there is some debate about the exact circumstances which may have led to the composition. The earliest reference to the work is known from Clement of Rome, writing around the end of the 1st century CE. The manuscript evidence begins in the 3rd century CE with seven verses of chapter fifteen inscribed on a pot sherd, and the major codices of the 4th and 5th centuries (Sinaiticus, Vaticanus and Alexandrinus) have the full text, with some differences.

These earliest textual witnesses are all in Greek. It was thought for a long time (and presented by Jerome) that the work was likely originally composed in Hebrew, but more recent work has begun to argue strongly in favour of a Greek original; Hebrew features of the text can be explained through connections with the Greek of the Septuagint (the Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible).

The work has inspired a lot of artist representation, which has furthered interest in the Book of Judith, but has also on occasion tended to misrepresent the evidence of the work itself. One notable case is the famous Caravaggio painting of Judith Beheading Holofernes (1598-1599), where Judith's maid (or slave) is depicted as an old women. This woman is said to outlive Judith, herself dying aged 105. While not a significant mistake, the artistic tradition nevertheless contributes to ongoing reception of the Book of Judith.",-160,80,44,1247,Joseph Scales,2024-02-22 11:58:27.317 +0100,2024-02-27 08:52:08.938 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2210,Living Faith Church Worldwide,43,Religious Group (v6),"The founding of the Living Faith Church  International is directly linked with the divine call of the founder in person of Bishop David O. Oyedepo.  So, it is good to begin with the life story of David Oyedepo and how he was called into the ministry. David Olaniyi Oyedepo was born in Osogbo, in the present Osun State, Nigeria  on September 27th, 1954. He is however, a native of Omu-Aran, Irepodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, Nigeria. He was raised in a mixed-religious family. His father, Ibrahim, was a Muslim healer.. His mother, Dorcas, was a member of the Holy Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (C&S), a branch of the Aladura movement in Nigeria. He was raised by his grandmother in Osogbo, who introduced him to the virtues of Christian life via early morning prayers. She also taught him the importance of tithing. After his primary and secondary education, Oyedepo proceeded to study architecture at the Kwara State Polytechnic Ilorin.. He worked briefly with the Federal Ministry of Housing in Ilorin before resigning to concentrate on missionary work. He was born again in 1969, through the influence of his teacher, Betty Lasher, who took an interest in him during his high school days. According to him, he received a mandate from God through an 18-hour vision in May 1981, to liberate the world from all oppression of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith. This inaugural vision led to the founding of the Living Faith Church World Wide (LFCWW), first called Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981. Two years later, on September 17, 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, ordained David and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (known as Faith Abiola Oyedepo) to become pastors and officially commissioned the new church. Five years later, he was ordained as Bishop by Archbishop Benson Idahosa. 
Living Faith Church (AKA Winners Chapel International) started in Kaduna but moved to Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria in July 1989, to start a new branch of the church after Bishop Oyedepo received instructions from God to reach out to the people of Lagos.  Since 21st August, 1982, Bishop David Oyedepo has been happily married to his heartthrob, Pastor Mrs. Florence Abiola Akano (now known as Faith). They have four children together (David Jr, Isaac, Love and Joyce). David Oyedepo (Jr) and Isaac Oyedepo were ordained as Pastors in May 2007 by Kenneth Copeland. David Oyedepo Jr formerly pastored the London Branch of the Church with his wife, Kemi but is now the resident pastor of the Ministry's headquarters church (Faith Tabernacle) while Isaac Oyedepo pastors Winners' Chapel International, Maryland, in the United States of America with his wife Ayomitide. His first daughter, Love is married to Stephen Ogah, who also pastors in Winners' Chapel. Joys Priscilla is the last child and second daughter. She got married to Abimbola Abodunrin in 2020.
Bishop Oyedepo began his Church ministry and planted the 1st Church in Kaduna, called, Living Faith World Outreach – Dec. 11, 1983. He published and released his first 2 books; ‘The Miracle seed, and The Law of Faith,’ in April 25, 1985. He founded the Word of Faith Bible Institute, which today runs across many nations of the world – Sep. 1: 1986. He began church planting work in the northern part of Nigeria – May 1987. His mission acquired a 13-acre property in a prime area of Kaduna city called Garden of Faith – Sep. 1989.  He moved into Lagos, following a divine mandate, “Arise get down to Lagos and raise me a people” – Sep. 24, 1989. He founded Dominion Publishing House, whose printing press has today grown to an industrial scale and currently publishing Bibles – July 1992. He led a great revival at the Lagos church that took the church from about 3,500 to 50,000 within 5 years – 1994-1999. 
Following another divine mandate “the harvest of Africa is overripe, rush in and preserve it from decadence, embark on Mission to Africa. Today, his mission now has a strong presence in over 41 nations of Africa – Jan. 1994.- His Mission took delivery of the first mission aircraft in Sept. 18, 1996. His mission acquired 530 acres of property in the outskirts of Ota, a suburb of Lagos which is today called Canaan land in May 1998. He was able to build 50,000-seat capacity sanctuary called Faith Tabernacle, was built and dedicated within one year between Sept. 1998 and Sept. 1999. He started the annual convocation of Winners worldwide, tagged “Shiloh” which now transmits to about 177 nations real time and draws delegates from between 50 and 60 nations annually, with millions gathering at various viewing centres across Nigeria and many other nations of the world  in 1999.
 He embarked on Mission to the world, covering Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australia and Middle East in August 2000.  He founded Covenant University, which is today listed among the Elite Universities of the world – October 2002. He founded Landmark University, a university blazing the trail today within the Nigerian university education space in Mar. 2011. 
He led a great church growth revival that doubled the attendance of the Lagos church twice within 6 months. Today, the Faith Tabernacle is said to be the largest local church congregation in the world, which runs four services every Sunday with about 38,000 Home cells – May – Oct. 2015. By divine instruction, he supervised the planting of over 5,000 churches across Nigeria within one year in 2019.
By divine mandate, he led the planting of over 10,000 churches within one year across Nigeria and over 1,200 others across 35 other nations of the world in spite of the restriction by the global lockdown occasioned by covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Also, by divine instruction, he led the replication of over 21,000 new home cells within one year at Faith Tabernacle, which represents about a hundred percent of the existing home cells in 2021. He further led the planting of Churches in 80 additional nations across 4 continents of the world in 2022. Currently, the construction of the historic 100,000-seat capacity stadium-like sanctuary, whose foundation was laid on March 25, 2021, is very much in progress, with the claim that God’s hand was clearly evident in the areas of speed, supplies, etc.. 

Canaan Land is in Ota, Ogun state and is the 5,000-acre (20 km2) estate and campus, that houses the 50,000 seat auditorium, the church secretariat, the church's youth chapel, a primary school called Kingdom heritage model school, a full boarding mission secondary school called Faith Academy, with over 1,500 students and the Covenant University facilities - which accommodates over 7,000 students, fully resident in ultra-modern hostel facilities - with fully equipped faculty buildings and numerous staff housing facilities. Canaan land campus also has for-profit establishments operated by the church such as a bakery, a bottled water processing plant, a petrol station, various restaurants and shopping stores, several residential houses that provide for the over 2,000 church employees and guesthouses. Four banks are also present on this Estate, three of which are branches of external commercial banks and one which is a community and micro-finance Bank and operated by the Church. The whole of Canaan land which includes a proposed 15,000 housing estate known as Canaan City had increased to 17,000 acres as at 2012. The Ministry's biggest annual meeting Shiloh, holds every December in the Faith Tabernacle. It hosts thousands of congregants across the world.

Winners Chapel International operates a Bible training programme known as the Word of Faith Bible Institute for members and non-members alike to develop knowledge of Christian principles as well as to develop leaders and future pastors. The institute is run in major branches of the Church. Oyedepo is the president and chairman of David Oyedepo Ministries International (DOMI), the umbrella organisation comprising Living Faith Church World Wide (a global network of churches), World Mission Agency (WMA); the global missionary arm of the church's operations, Dominion Publishing House (DPH - the publishing arm of the church), Covenant University, and the Social Development Missions projects - made up of hospitals, maternity homes, schools, etc. Oyedepo has criticized corruption in Africa as a whole and poor leadership in government.  
The Living Faith Church also operates its own publishing house, called Dominion Publishing House (DPH). Commissioned on December 5, 1992, the publishing house has published over 70 Christian, inspirational and motivational books, mini books, magazines and other resources.",1981,2024,2119,1533,Enoch Gbadegesin,2024-02-22 15:52:33.852 +0100,2024-03-26 12:48:12.964 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The site has been referred to as a monastic complex, but this has been contested. Hugh Elton has suggested that this, along with Alahan, may have served primarily as a site of pilgrimage and that the cells may have been for temporary visitors rather than coenobitic living quarters. The site features a basilica church, a trefoil structure which may have been a baptistery or martyrium, as well as an additional ill-maintained structure thought to have been communal dormitories. All structures at the site have been fabricated from local limestone ashlar and feature minimal surviving decoratio. The complex is believed to have been constructed during the fifth century when Isaurian-born Zeno held the imperial throne.

The site served a bishopric district in the fifth century, and holds a significant number of ecclesiastical structures in various levels of deterioration from this period, including a cathedral basilica and baptistery dating roughly from the fifth to sixth century, a fifth century ambulatory church contemporary with the nearby sites of Alahan and Mahras Dağı, and a fifth century basilica church outside of the city walls that believed to have been a funerary church. This Funerary extra muros Basilica was partially cut into the natural karst rock and sits on an elevated terrace outside of the city’s fortification overlooking the northern banks of the Kavak Gözü stream. The church has suffered extensive damage, likely the result of a landslide. Architecturally, all of the above-mentioned structures are built out of local limestone, rubble and mortar; and likely had a timber and tile roofs. There is evidence in the extra muros Basilica of a simplistic mosaic floor. Comparisons between the extra muros basilica at the site can be made with the extra muros tomb church found at Corycus as well as the necropolis church at Anemurium. The ambulatory church features a three aisled basilica floor plan with barrel vaulted aisles, a narthex, and bell tower. It is also possible that there was an atrium located off of the western façade. The bema features pink stone mosaic flanked by ornamental crosses enclosed by rich geometric decoration and a central scene of two lambs facing one another with vegetal designs surrounding them.",400,2024,2264,1554,Aurora Camaño,2024-02-22 23:56:10.142 +0100,2024-02-22 23:56:10.142 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2213,Geghard Monastery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The monastery of Geghard, located in the upper Azat valley in Armenia, is a UNESCO recognized medieval monastic complex containing several churches and subsidiary buildings. The Azat valley features high elevations and rock faces, which were used to both quarry ashlar for the buildings of Geghard as well as were incorporated into the design of several of the structures at the site, with several of the ecclesiastical monuments and niches being cut directly into the living rock. Monk cells were also cut into the living rock or made from natural caverns. Tradition states that the monastery was founded by Saint Gregory the Illuminator, an important religious figure in the Armenian tradition who converted the Armenian King to Christianity, leading the nation to adopt Christianity as its official state religion. The oldest still-standing structure, a 12th century chapel with basilica floorplan partially cut from the natural rock is dedicated to St. Gregory. Other important monuments at the site include the Katoghike Chapel, which features a a cross-in-square floorplan and domed ceiling and dates to the early 13th century. This chapel was commissioned by the Zakarid-Mkgargrzeli family who were a high-status Armenian-Georgian family. The southern façade of this chapel is decorated in bas reliefs, and the tympanum showcases intricate vegetal carvings depicting vining leaves, grapes, and pomegranates. The portals and cupola of the Katoghike chapel include multiple animal scenes, including doves and other birds, animal heads, and a lion attacking an ox, in addition to floral and geometric motifs. The site of Geghard is noted for its particularly large free-standing Gavit also dating to the 13th century. This structure features several large interior columns and barrel vaulted ceiling with a domed oculus to let in light. The interior and exterior heavily decorated with floral and vegetal relief ornamentation and kachkars. Several additional connected rock-cut churches, including a church which features a natural spring running through were built adorned with bas reliefs in the mid 13th century by architect and artist Galdzak. At least one of the rock-cut churches was a commission by Prince Prosh, whose family purchased the monastery from the Zakarid family in the mid 13th century. A Jamatoun, or burial vault, completed construction in the late 13th century and is built into the rock, including a rock-cut staircase for the Proshian family. Ornamentation of this vault include the coat of arms of the Proshian family. A second Jamatoun, known as the upper Jamatoun, was commissioned by the son of Prince Prosh, and was hewn to contain the royal tombs tombs of the princes Merik and Girgor. Beyond the detailed vegetal and floral ornamentation which adorn many of the buildings at Geghard, there are several figural reliefs of people, including soldiers and donor portraits holding a church, as well as animals such as lions, eagles, and goats are present. A common Armenian motif, the siren, represented by winged birds with crowned female heads, also adorn the portals of some chapels. Today the site is a major tourist destination, while still maintaining its cultural and religious significance and serving as a place of worship for Armenian Christians.",1100,2024,2268,1554,Aurora Camaño,2024-02-23 02:31:50.980 +0100,2024-02-23 02:31:50.980 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2216,Monastery of Mega Spilaion,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastery of Mega Spilaion (meaning “great cave” in Greek) was formally known as the Monastery of the Dormition of the Theotokos (in Greek Ιερά Μονή Κοιμήσεως της Θεοτόκου). It is hewn to the west side of mount Chelmos at an altitude of 900 m over the steep Vouraikos gorge, some 11 km from the town of Kalavryta, in Peloponnese, southern Greece. The cave was known in antiquity, since the geographer Pausanias was reporting that the daughters of Proetus found refuge there during their madness. During the first Christian centuries, hermits have occupied the cave. 
Mega Spilaion is one of the oldest monasteries in Greece, and according to tradition it was founded in 362 by the brothers Symeon and Theodore from Thessaloniki, who discovered in a cave the icon of the Theotokos. They were guided by Euphrosyni, a young local shepherdess. The two brothers had previously lived as monks on Mount Athos and went to pilgrimage to Jerusalem and Sinai, prior to arriving to the cave and finding the icon. The icon of the Mother of God (Panagia Megalospilaiotissa, meaning “Virgin of the Great Cave” in Greek) is an important relic, since it is believed that this was the first depiction of Virgin Mary painted by Apostle and Evangelist Luke, brought with him during his mission in the Peloponnese. Furthermore, according to Byzantine historians and the imperial chrysobull issued to the Monastery of Mega Spilaion, Apostle Luke wrote his Gospel in the same cave fifteen years after the Ascension of Christ. It was suggested that Theophilus to whom the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles are addressed may have been the governor of the region, where the Monastery is located. 
The history of the Monastery under Byzantine and Latin rule is quite obscure. It gained prominence from about 1354 onwards, when it served as the residence of the Orthodox Bishop of Patras, since the city was occupied by the Latins, and hence became the seat of the Latin Archbishopric. The monastic complex suffered large-scale destructions in 849 during Iconoclasm, in 1400, and 1640, when it was comprehensively rebuilt, since the fire destroyed the auxiliary buildings and important number of liturgical objects and artefacts. The katholikon (main church) of the Monastery was preserved until 1934, when it was burned. It was repaired in 1937. In 1943, the German troops pillaged it and executed 22 persons (monks, pilgrims and workers). New buildings were built after the Second World War, which nowadays comprise an eight-storey complex set in the 120 metres high facade of the cliff. The Monastery was restored between 2003 and 2013. There are four more chapels: the first is where blessed  Euphrosyni, the shepherdess was praying, and the other three are dedicated to Saint Catherine, Saint Luke of Steiris and the Taxiarchs. Outside the walls of the Monastery there are three more chapels dedicated to Saint Anthony, the Holy Trinity and chapel at the cemetery dedicated to All Saints. Above the Monastery at the top of the rock, where two towers were built during the war for liberation from the Ottomans, there are two more chapels: the first is dedicated to Saint Luke and the other to the Ascension of Jesus Christ. The 17th-century katholikon is decorated with frescoes and has mosaic flooring and a bronze door with relief decoration. At the museum of the Monastery are exhibited important liturgical objects and artefacts, while an important number of relics, including those of its two founders and the shepherdess, blessed Euphrosyni, are kept in a special hall. 
Mega Spilaion operates as a male Monastery and officially celebrates the feast of the Dormition of Virgin Mary (15 August), the feast of the Elevation of the Holy Cross (14 September), since it holds a piece of the Cross of Jesus Christ, and finally on the 18th of October, the feast of the founders of the Monastery and of Apostle Luke the Evangelist, to whom is attributed the venerated icon of the Mother of God.",362,2024,2270,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-02-25 15:19:52.384 +0100,2024-02-27 17:57:58.430 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2218,Church of Saint Nicholas Orphanos,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of Saint Nicholas Orphanos (meaning “orphan” in Greek) is located in the higher part of the city of Thessaloniki (Ano Poli), near the western walls. It is dated to the second decade of the 14th century. The title “Orphanos” or “of the Orphans” attributed to the church appears in sources of the 17th and the 18th centuries. It was associated either with the unknown founder of the church and his family, or, with the status of Saint Nicholas, who is considered the patron of widows and orphans. The construction of the monument is probably dated by its wall paintings, dated between 1310-1320. It was initially the katholikon (main church) of a monastery, which it is believed to have been founded by the Serbian ruler Milutin. During the Ottoman period, the church was a metochion of the Vlatadon Monastery, also located in the upper part of the city of Thessaloniki. Apart from the katholikon, what remains from the monastery are fragments from its entrance. The church was originally a three-aisled basilica. It is currently composed of a long, timber-roofed central area, which is surrounded by an ambulatory, covered by lean-to roofs, lower than the one over the central nave. It has in the east two chapels. The nave communicates with the north and south arms of the ambulatory through double-arched openings, while there is a small entrance for passing from the narthex to the main church. 
Apart from the reused Early Christian capitals, which have two rows of sawn acanthus leaves, as well as the marble iconostasis contemporary with the church, there is no other sculpted decorative elements in the church. Saint Nicholas Orphanos is decorated with wall paintings, revealed in 1957-1960 during the restoration of the monument. They are considered among the finest examples of the mature Palaeologan Renaissance. They date from the decade 1310-1320 and they are associated with the artistic circle of the painters Georgios Kalliergis, Michael and Eutychios Astrapas, all from Thessaloniki. Their creator is probably the one who also painted the katholikon of the Athonite Hilandar Monastery, during the time of the Serbian king Miliutin (1314). In the nave, at the lowest level, are depicted military and healing saints. They are accompanied by representations of the Virgin and Christ, depicted near the sanctuary, and the figures of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Theologian, of particular importance for their eschatological meaning. The upper levels of the north, south and west walls narrate the Passion of Christ, while over the west entrance, is depicted the Dormition of the Theotokos. The twelve Great Feasts and scenes narrating the events after the Resurrection of Christ are depicted on the higher parts of the nave and the sanctuary. In the apse is painted the supplicant Virgin between two archangels, and below, the Melismos (a symbolic representation of the Holy Eucharist) and Hierarchs. Hierarchs and Church Fathers are also painted on the walls of the sanctuary. Above them, on the east wall, is the scene of the Communion of the Apostles and the Holy Mandylion. On the south wall of the north arm of the ambulatory are depicted Saints, and above, two zones with scenes inspired by the Akathistos Hymn. On the north wall of the south arm of the ambulatory, the lower part is covered with scenes from the Life of Saint Gerasimos and the Burning Bush. In the narthex, apart from the zone of saints, there is an extensive pictorial cycle narrating the Life of Saint Nicholas. There are also scenes from the Lives of other Saints. 
The monument was inscribed with fourteen more Palaeochristian and Byzantine monuments of the city of Thessaloniki, in the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites.",1310,2024,2272,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-02-25 20:57:38.258 +0100,2024-02-28 07:50:10.676 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2219,Heart Sūtra,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Heart Sūtra [Ch. Xinjing 心經; Skt. Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya Sūtra; Tib. snying po'i mdo] is among the most popular Buddhist sūtras, notably in East Asia. It purports to be the essence, or the 'heart,' of the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra [Skt. Prajñāpāramitā sūtras], a highly influential set of Mahāyāna sūtras known for the doctrine of emptiness (Skt. śūnyatā) which teaches that all entities lack intrinsic nature (Skt. svabhava) and that wisdom, in this sense, consists of a non-conceptual understanding of emptiness. 

The Heart Sūtra is known for its ability to transmit the profound wisdom of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras in a succinct format. The most popular version in East Asia, believed to be a translation by Xuanzang 玄奘 (602-664) made in 649, consists of merely 260 characters. The Heart Sūtra opens with the statement that Avalokiteśvara understood the emptiness of all things and proceeds with the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara's sermon to Śāriputra, one of the Buddha's disciples. In this sermon, Avalokiteśvara foregrounds the teaching of the emptiness by systematically negates the major categories of Buddhist thought—including such seminal lists as the five aggregates, twelve sense-fields, and twelve links of dependent origination. Even nirvana is said to be ultimately empty. Its famous statement ‘form is emptiness (śūnyatā), emptiness is form’ is widely known in East Asia, even beyond Buddhist communities. 

The sūtra ends with a famous mantra of Prajñāpāramitā. This mantra, and the Heart Sūtra in general, are popularly used for protective purposes, and for this reason, the Heart Sūtra has been considered by some scholars not as a sūtra but a dhāraṇī, a Buddhist textual genre related to tantra that consists of incantations believed to possess amuletic power. In Tibetan context, the Heart Sūtra is often considered both a sūtra and tantra. There exist numerous tantric ritual manuals based on the Heart Sūtra, with Prajñāpāramitā being the goddess of worship.  

The Heart Sutra encompasses two primary versions: the longer and the shorter. The longer version, favored in India, incorporates traditional Buddhist narrative framing, unlike the shorter version, which presents certain anomalies in comparison to typical Indian sutras. It features Avalokitesvara, a deity of significant influence in China, with approximately 40% of its content being quotations from Nagarjuna's commentary on a Perfection of Wisdom sutra, and the remainder being original compositions. These textual irregularities, among others, led scholar Jan Nattier to speculate that the earliest translation of the shorter version, attributed to Kumārajīva, might have been a Chinese creation. This version is believed to have served as the foundation for Xuanzang's later translation. Given its profound impact across East Asia, the suggestion of its apocryphal origins carries considerable implications.",350,2024,2273,1581,Weiyu Lin,2024-02-26 07:27:43.376 +0100,2024-03-27 01:21:09.832 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2221,A Votive Inscription to Hathor/Baʿalat,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This text is a bilingual Egyptian-Semitic votive inscription dedicated to the goddess Baʿalat/Hathor engraved on a red sandstone Sphinx statuette. The Semitic portion of the inscription runs along the upper edge of the statuette’s base, while the Egyptian portion appears on the sphinx’s right flank. The sphinx itself was originally deposited in the Hathor temple at Serabit el-Khadem, an Egyptian turquoise mining facility located in the Sinai Peninsula. The content of the inscription does not provide many clues as to what the sphinx’s owner hoped to gain from dedicating it. The Semitic portion simply reads “Beloved of Baʿalat. This inscription is for Baʿalat,” while Egyptian portion declares “Beloved of Hathor, [Lady] of Turquoise.”  Several Egyptian inscriptions from Serabit el-Khadem, however, ask for a safe return home or the perpetuation of the dedicator’s memory, so it seems likely that the current text had a similar aim. The presence of a Semitic language inscription on the sphinx reflects the participation of Semitic speaking populations in the mining expeditions to Serabit el-Khadem.",-1850,-1500,2276,1565,Aren Wilson-Wright,2024-02-27 19:36:41.126 +0100,2024-02-27 22:40:27.712 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World
2222,Kohunlich. Un enlaze político - religioso entre el Petén y el norte de la Península de Yucatán,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Ubicado al sur del estado de Quintana Roo a 65 km de Chetumal. La región selvática es muy húmeda y el suelo está constituido principalmente por rocas sedimentarias, destacando las rocas calizas y las de yeso.

El primero en mencionar este sitio fue el arqueólogo estadounidense Raymond Merwin, quien en 1912 lo denominó ""Clarksville"" en un mapa de la región que él mismo elaboró. Por su parte, el nombre Kohunlich deriva de otro apelativo en inglés con el cual se conoció a la zona arqueológica: Cohoon Ridge que quiere decir ""colina de corozos"" al que posteriormente, los pobladores la llamaban ""cojumrich"" hasta que, finalmente, el arqueólogo Víctor Segovia la llamó Kohunlich, dotando al nombre de un sonido más acorde a la fonética maya.
Durante la época prehispánica, Kohunlich mantuvo una ocupación continua desde el año 500 a.C. hasta el 1100 d.C; aproximadamente. Experimentó al menos dos altibajos demográficos: el primero, a mediados del Clásico, del que se recuperó; y el segundo, después del año 1000 d. C., que culminó con su abandono total.
El sitio arqueológico es un enorme asentamiento, conformado por una serie de complejos arquitectónicos de carácter ceremonial y residencial, algunos de los cuales pudieron funcionar como barrios o agrupamientos familiares de la élite.
Sus edificios muestran diversas etapas constructivas y estilos arquitectónicos. Los más tempranos se pueden asociar a un estilo de la región del Petén; no obstante, en el Clásico Tardío desarrolló un estilo propio conocido como ""estilo Pixa'an"" debido al complejo habitacional del mismo nombre donde se encuentra su ejemplo más acabado. Dicho estilo se caracteriza por sus muros lisos de piedra colocada ""a hueso"" -es decir, sin mortero-, molduras que enmarcan grupos de columnillas, jambas redondeadas en el acceso principal, columnas embebidas o empotradas, y nichos en las fachadas. Este tipo de arquitectura también se encuentra en edificios de la Plaza de las Estelas y de la Acrópolis.

Aunque se desconocen los motivos que provocaron el declive de Kohunlich, es probable que la diversificación étnica derivada de la llegada de grupos numerosos de migrantes durante el Clásico Tardío, y la posible constitución de entidades políticas autónomas, hayan sido la causa fundamental del desmembramiento de la zona, así como el debilitamiento del grupo que ejercía el poder.",-200,900,2277,1559,Orlando Casares Contreras,2024-02-27 23:21:37.506 +0100,2024-02-27 23:21:56.627 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2225,"Culdees, Céli Dé, Céili Dé, Céle Dé,  ""Clients of God"", ""Servants of God"", ""Spouses of God"", ""Companions of God"", Kelidei, Kaledei; Céile Dé",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Culdees (an Anglicisation of the Irish term ""céli Dé"" – Clients of God; singular ""Céile Dé"") were members of a monastic movement (possibly reforming in its nature) that initially appeared in Ireland in the eighth century or individual ecclesiastics emerging from this network, such as it was. The céli Dé constituted individuals and groups of ascetic and eremitical monastics, although their precise nature is obscure and subject to debate. The movement emerged in Ireland in the middle of the eighth century and remained active in the following centuries. The Culdees played a key role in the religious landscape of the Ireland until the burgeoning of foreign religious orders in the twelfth century and the influx of continental Catholicism. They appear to have constituted an elite stratum within the early Irish Church. The Culdees continued longer in Irish-influenced areas of Scotland where the notion of a “Culdee Church” has been important to some modern (largely Presbyterian) conceptions of a “purer”, independent, or distinct tradition of church governance, organisation, and identity in the pre-modern Scottish or ""Celtic"" Church that is thought to have been at variance with Rome (sometimes referred to as the “Culdee Church). There is some evidence that the group in its earlier stages comprised bands of anchorites which numbered thirteen or communities of twelve brethren and a prior (cenn “chief”) in emulation of Christ and the Apostles.  In some places, for example, Armagh – Ireland’s primatial city – the group seems to have continued much longer than elsewhere. In Armagh, the community that was Culdee in origin survived into the sixteenth century before succumbing to the Henrician dissolution of the monasteries in 1541. Although the later community at Armagh was only Culdee in origin, having departed from their primitive form and been superseded by Canons Regular, this origin represents the centrality of the movement to some of the most important religious foundations in Ireland.  The Culdees represented the flourishing of a particular insular kind of Christian monasticism in Ireland following the consolidation of the faith by Patrick in the fifth century and the influx of foreign orders in the twelfth. The Culdees espoused a mission that was centred on secular ministry, austere monasticism, piety, austerity, humility, mortification, simplicity, care of the sick and poor, and the ascetic lifestyle. However, the extent to which the Culdees were a formally organised “order” and the exact nature of their vows, monastic rule, community life, and practices are not conclusively understood. Despite these uncertainties, there was clearly a distinct strand within Irish Christianity which can be distinguished by this term. A number of notable historical figures are associated (or thought to be associated) with the céli Dé including Óengus of Tallaght (or Óengus the Culdee, author of the Félire Óengusso, an important early martyrology from Tallaght), Máel Ruain, and the Old Irish poet Blathmac mac Con Brettan. Important Culdee sites in Ireland include Armagh, Clones, Clonmacnoise, Devenish Island, Dunshaughlin, Fore, Inis Cathaigh, Lismore, Monaincha (Ros Cré), and Tallaght. Important sites in Scotland include Abernethy, Brechin, Dunkeld, Loch Leven (and the island of St Serf’s Inch therein), Monifieth, Monymusk, Scone, and St Andrews.",700,1100,2283,1422,John Gallagher,2024-02-28 18:28:36.346 +0100,2024-03-01 23:33:58.732 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2226,Leimonos Monastery,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastery of Saint Ignatios, also called Moni Leimonos (meaning “Monastery of the meadow” in Greek) on the Greek island of Lesbos, not far from the small town of Kalloni, was founded in 1526 by Saint Ignatios Agallianos. It was presumably erected on the remains of a Byzantine monastery which was abandoned around 1462, when the island was taken by the Ottomans. There is no evidence, however, regarding its history, apart from references by Saint Ignatios in his Testament (Typikon), who mentions that the Monastery was built on an existing foundation and with his own expenses (“εκ παλαιών θεμελίων” and “εξ ιδίων αναλωμάτων”). Leimonos Monastery, currently known under the name of its founder, was initially dedicated to Archangel Michael. At Leimonos Monastery, Saint Ignatios founded a school known as Leimoniada, where he also taught along with other learned teachers and scholars. Leimoniada school was functioning until 1923. The Monastery, which currently operates as a men’s convent, is avaton (banned on women to enter it) as prescribed by its founder.
The katholikon (main church) was founded in 1526. Many renovations have taken place through time, the present structure being the result of 18th-century (1795-1796) works. The timber-roofed three-aisled basilica has a narthex composed of two parts and covered atriums (north and south). It has also five chapels. Four of them (dedicated to Saint John the Theologian, Saint Charalampos, Zoodochos Pigi, and, Saint Alexandros of Mythimna) occupy the corners of the church, while the fifth is located next to the sanctuary. The katholikon is decorated with frescoes from two different periods. The earliest, fragments of which survive in the apse of the sanctuary, date to the late 16th century and follow the style of the Macedonian school that flourished in the 15th century. The latest date to 1800. The inscription in the narthex mentions that they were painted by the Athonite monk Nikiphoros. The church is furnished with a gilded wooden iconostasis in Ottoman baroque style, made by craftspeople from Chios island.
The north side of the central group of buildings in the monastery is taken up by the old wing of cells that date from the 16th century. The cell in which Saint Ignatios has lived is on the first floor. In the cell used as a chapel is still preserved a fresco fragment from the 16th century depicting the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The fragment may have been detached and brought there from the katholikon, probably during the renovation works of the end of the 18th century. The Monastery is surrounded by many chapels. The chapel of the cemetery, outside the walls of the Monastery serves also as an ossuary. It is a 16th‑century single-aisle basilica of small dimensions, partly decorated with frescoes (sanctuary) that follow the Cretan style of Byzantine hagiography. It was most probably built during the lifetime of the Monastery’s founder, Saint Ignatios. Another 16th-century chapel is the one dedicated to the Transfiguration of Jesus Christ, which once belonged to the metochion (dependence) of Christ the Saviour that no longer exists, apart from the chapel in question. In the church was preserved a fragment of fresco depicting the Melismos (a symbolic representation of the Holy Eucharist). The Melismos fragment, as well as the important collection of religious objects and artefacts of the Monastery are exhibited at the museum created for showcasing them. Leimonos Monastery owns also an exceptionally rich collection of manuscripts, early printed books and documents, while it houses also a Geological museum and a Folk Art Museum.",1526,2024,2284,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-02-29 21:30:44.855 +0100,2024-03-03 14:46:42.576 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2228,Church of God Mission,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is about the Church of God Mission, a Christian denomination (Pentecostal/Charismatic). The Church of God Mission was founded in Nigeria by Benson Idahosa in the year 1972. The root of the Church of God Mission can be traced back to a prayer group that was named Calvary Fellowship which was inaugurated by Edgar Perkings (a clergy) officially in 1965 (though they began meeting in 1962). They started by meeting in a shop on Ivbizua Street, off Mission Road. Benson Idahosa was at that time the Sunday School Superintendent of Assemblies of God Church but on October 26, 1968,  Perkins requested that the leadership of the Assemblies of God church release Idahosa to oversee the prayer ministry. After Idahosa took over leadership, the group moved to Number 26, Forestry Road, Benin City. The group began to experience numerical growth leading to the erection of church buildings. They moved into the Iyaro Church building in 1974 which resulted in more numerical growth. Syney Elton and Gordon Lindsay who were both foreign missionaries were the ones who declared the church open. Benson Idahosa was one of the most outstanding gospel preachers of his time in Africa. He is referred to as a leading Independent “mega-church” preacher in Africa. He was trained at the Christ for the Nations Institute, Dallas, Texas (an independent Pentecostal college) for three months in 1971. 

The church Motto is: Evangelism our Supreme Task. Idahosa believed he is sent by God to raise up an army that will go with the gospel to all Nations to teach, preach and heal in the power of the Holy Spirit as exemplified by the life of Idahosa. This led to the church soul conversion efforts, church planting and erection of modern church buildings. The numerical growth of the church led the building of Miracle Centre and dedication in 1975 with seating capacity of over 10,000. He got good financial support for these buildings from American partners such as Gordon and Freda Lindsay, T.L. Osborn and Jim Bakker. Faith Miracle Centre auditorium reputed to seat over 20,000 people was completed in 1986. Several other church building was erected later and the church grew to have branches all over the world. By 1991 Church of God Mission had at least 300,000 members and a ministry headquarters in Benin City, in the southern part of Nigeria. Benson Idahosa and the Church of God Mission had good relationships with other charismatic organizations in Africa and beyond. The mentees of Benson Idahosa (who later became Archbishop) are many, they include; David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church and the Founder of Covenant University, Christ Oyakilome of the Believers Love World Church, Ayo Oritsejafor of the Word of Life Bible Church, Johnson Suleiman of Omega Fire Ministries, Mike Okonkwo of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM), Wale Oke, Fred Ado and the Ghanian pastor, Dunkan Williams,

Benson Idahosa was seen as controversial when he promoted the financial and material prosperity of the church by his preaching the wealth and health gospel. Idahosa posits that Christians are supposed to enjoy material things such as televisions, automobiles, have money, possess the good things of life and that the church should not be poor. The church in Nigeria today as a result is one of the wealthiest in the world with more than 30 universities, many primaries and secondary schools, hospitals and other diversified investments. It became controversial because some opined that he emphasized prosperity at the expense of gamine biblical virtues such as faithfulness, integrity and holy living. He had confrontations with witches and wizards during his life time. In a live press conference Benson Idahosa opposed and stopped the proposed world conference of at least 9,800witches and wizard scheduled to hold in Benin City, Nigeria when he threatened that death will be the result for the conveners.The Church of God Mission began The All Nations for Christ Bible Institute to gospel ministers. This institute grew to become the leading bible institute in Africa during Idahosa’s lifetime. The Word of Faith Group of Schools was started to carter for the educational needs of those in pre-nursery, primary and secondary schools. The Benson Idahosa University was started to carter for the tertiary educational needs of the people.  The Faith Mediplex Group of Hospitals was initiated to attend to the medical needs of the people. In 1998 the sudden death of the Founder of the Church of God Mission was announced and his wife and ministry partner assumed leadership of the ministry. It has been reported that Idahosa’s demise had negative impact on the continued growth and unity of the Church of God Mission.
The church of God Mission International Headquarter is located in Benin City, Nigeria, West Africa. The Church of God Mission International lay claim to membership of over 7million in over 178 nations and territories across the globe. Research shows that the church has over 6000 branches globally.",1972,2024,1082,1526,Oyeyemi Oyekan,2024-03-01 06:27:12.883 +0100,2024-03-27 23:47:13.005 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2229,Church of Saint Demetrios,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Metropolitan church (Cathedral) of Mystras and seat of the Diocese of Lacedaemonia (up to the first years after the liberation of Greece from the Ottomans) is dedicated to Saint Demetrios. It is situated in the north-east part of the lower city of the settlement, close to the main gate and within the complex of buildings known as the Metropolis. It dates to the second half of the 13th century. It is the earliest among the surviving late-byzantine churches of Mystras, built in the form of a wooden-roofed basilica. It was probably founded by Bishop Eugenios (1262-1272), depicted in the diakonikon (area south of the sanctuary), where is located also his tomb. Theodosios (1272-1283?), Eugenios’ successor, commanded a large portion of the wall paintings of the church. Theodosios was also depicted in the church, kneeling before the Virgin in the conch of the apse of the sanctuary. His portrait was later scratched off, most probably because he was a supporter of the Union of the Greek and the Roman Churches. However, the carved inscriptions mention Nikephoros Moschopoulos as the founder of Saint Demetrios. To Moschopoulos hand is also attributed part of the frescoes of the church, including the figures of the apostles in the south aisle, painted sometime in the end of the 13th century. Later, around 1310, in the narthex more scenes were painted, including those of the Second Coming and of the Oecumenical Councils, following the latest stylistic trends of Palaeologan art. 
In the first half of the 15th century galleries were added to the church under Bishop Matthaios, as mentioned by a relief inscription. It was then that the monument took its final form, belonging to the so‑called ""mixed type of Mystras"", which combines the three-aisled basilica plan on the ground floor and the five-domed, cross-in-square plan in the upper part, with three three-sided arches to the east. According to tradition, the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos was crowned at the church in 1449. The embossed double-headed eagle of the Palaiologos family on the floor of Saint Demetrios, under the dome, is believed to have been the exact spot where the coronation has taken place. The last renovations of the monument were associated with the supposed coronation of Constantine Palaiologos, a hypothesis that does not appear to be supported by the sources. The exterior wall paintings of the north portico, depicting four deceased metropolitans of the 14th and early 15th centuries, have also been associated with Bishop Matthaios. The complex of the Metropolis is composed as well of structures added later: the tower-shaped bell tower (southeast corner), arched porticos (west facade and north side), a north courtyard with arches and two-storey structures (north), at the instigation of Bishop Ananias, who was slaughtered by the Ottomans in 1760.
The sculptural decoration of the church is from different periods and thus varies in style. The most significant examples are the carved iconostasis, the sculptural elements of which date to c.1200 and were reused, having originally belonged to an unknown church of the southern Peloponnese; the two proskynetaria with relief designs; the architrave from the time of Bishop Matthaios, with designs carved in porous stone and the parapets in the frieze of the upper room. The name of the aforementioned Bishop also appears (abbreviated) on the proskynetaria of the iconostasis. Within the complex of the Metropolis was created a Museum where are exhibited selected objects and artefacts from the Byzantine period from Mystras and Sparta.",1260,2024,2285,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-03-02 16:16:46.564 +0100,2024-03-11 18:39:09.573 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2232,"Lollards, Lollard, the Lollard movement, Lollardism,  Lollardy, Wycliffites",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lollards were a proto-Protestant, dissident, heretical sect that emerged towards the end of the fourteenth century England in England, the ideas of which continued as a strand of religious thought until the English Reformation of the sixteenth century. Lollardy and its adherents were thought to be associated with the Oxford scholar John Wycliffe and his circle of followers, and to follow their ideas and teachings. Although the two groups share ideas, “Wycliffite” more accurately describes the cadre of academic theologians and associated individuals who followed the teaching of Wycliffe, while the term “Lollard” is more general and denotes anyone or anything deemed heretical, those who criticised the practices of the Church, and those who called for reform. Although the etymology is uncertain, “Lollard” is said to derive from the Middle Dutch verb lollen “to sing” (a derogatory reference to muttering or mumbling) or, more likely, from Latin lolium “tare”, a sort of damaging weed and a reference to the Parable of the Weeds. Within both the Wycliffites and the Lollards, emphasis was placed on personal faith, vernacular scripture, divine election, and biblical authority. Aspects of Church teaching and practice that they criticised include transubstantiation, clerical celibacy, ecclesiastical hierarchy, indulgences, pilgrimage, iconography, the cult of the saints, fasting and abstinence, and other aspects of Catholic practice. In some respects, the Lollards resemble earlier groups focused on reform, such as the Fraticelli, and exerted significant influence on later continental movements such as the Hussites in Bohemia, which began with the reformer, Jan Hus. Lollard ideas came to enjoy a popular and widespread currency after 1400 and has a significant impact on the theological landscape of the fifteenth-century in England.",1350,1500,2289,1422,John Gallagher,2024-03-04 16:48:47.046 +0100,2024-03-08 22:34:21.302 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2233,The Way of Former Heaven (Xiantiandao 先天道),43,Religious Group (v6),"Xiantiandao 先天道, the “Way of Former Heaven,” is the common designation of a network of Chinese popular sects that share similar symbols, beliefs, and practices and from which many later Chinese redemptive societies, such as Yiguandao 一貫道 (""The Way of Pervading Unity"") and Tongshanshe 同善社 (""The Fellowship of Goodness"") emerged. In addition, Xiantiandao is a significant influence on the Vietnamese new religious movement Cao Dai (Đạo Cao Đài) that emerged from Sino-Vietnamese sectarian groups in 1920s French-colonial Saigon. 
While claiming descent from a genealogy of enlightened masters that goes back to the dawn of Chinese civilization, Xiantiandao emerged as a distinct religious group in eighteenth-century Jiangxi Province in southeastern China. In this early period, practitioners and outsiders seem to have referred to the sect and its teachings by various names, including Xiantiandao and Qinglianjiao 青蓮教 (""Green Lotus Sect""), a term that appears in nineteenth-century government surveillance material. Having appealed to traveling merchants and labor migrants in the nineteenth century, Xiantiandao quickly spread throughout southern and southwestern China and, from the 1860s onward, also to Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and what is now Singapore and Malaysia. 
Like many other nonofficial sects, Xiantiandao was subject to state persecution and vilification as an “evil sect” (xiejiao 邪教)—a deprecatory label employed by government officials and cultural elites to criminalize nonofficial religious groups that is still used today in public and political discourses in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Accordingly, Xiantiandao was banned and persecuted by consecutive Chinese regimes, including the PRC. Thus, although almost entirely eradicated on the Chinese mainland since the early 1950s when it was considered a “counterrevolutionary sect” (fandong huidaomen 反動會道門), the sect still retained a considerable presence among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. In fact, state persecution has fueled Xiantiandao’s translocal spread in many ways. For instance, many practitioners were forced underground following a large-scale crackdown in southwestern China in the 1840s. With many leaders apprehended and executed and forced to act clandestinely, Xiantiandao branched into various subsects and local networks, many of which later evolved into independent sectarian groups. The well-known redemptive societies Tongshanshe and Yiguandao, but also others such as Guigendao 歸根道 (“The Way of Returning to the Origin”) split off from Xiantiandao during this period of instability in the second half of the nineteenth century. 
Similar to many other Chinese sects, Xiantiandao’s teachings are often described as “syncretic.” This characterization highlights its peculiar synthesis of established symbols and beliefs—most notably the so-called “Three Teachings” (sanjiao 三教) of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—and millenarian beliefs centering on the supramundane creator deity Wusheng Laomu 無生老母 (“Eternal Venerable Mother”) and her salvationist mission to rescue humankind from the impending apocalypse. Stressing individual moral self-cultivation as a means to restore one’s inherent original nature (a Buddhist concept), Xiantiandao practitioners seek to repatriate to Laomu’s “original homeland” (guxiang 故鄉) from which the early humans were exiled many eons ago. The sect’s teachings are immersed in a narrative of decline and moral corruption, according to which humankind is doomed to be annihilated in the final cosmic apocalypse, and only by following Laomu’s teachings will humans be able to restore their inherent true selves and return to her eternal paradise. Like in many earlier popular sects during the Qing period and many later ones, including Yiguandao and Tongshanshe, this narrative is embedded in a cycle of three consecutive cosmic periods. Even though the final period, which is called baiyang 白陽 (“White Sun”), represents the beginning of the world’s end, it also marks the period during which the universal truth is being made available to all of humankind, whereas in earlier cosmic periods, only selected people had access to it. Accordingly, the baiyang period represents a time of high urgency to spread the teachings and help more people avoid the apocalypse. 
Besides highlighting how Confucian-oriented social values are instrumental in actualizing one’s true self, vegetarianism is crucial in Xiantiandao teachings. Drawing on Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian notions of meat abstention and fasting, it serves many purposes, from ritual purification to ethical concerns and cleaning up karmic bonds of one’s past existences. In addition, many Xiantiandao rituals, individual and communal, are conceptualized in Daoist-inspired terms, most notably neidan 內丹 (“internal alchemy”). Adopting the trope of laboratory alchemy to conceptualize meditative practices, neidan practitioners typically seek to invert the natural course of life by refining subtle substances within the human body to nurture an immortal embryo that will withstand the decay and death of the physical body. Finally, as far as we know, Xiantiandao is the earliest Chinese sectarian group to have adopted spirit-writing (fuluan 扶鸞, “yielding the phoenix,” or fuji 扶乩, “yielding the planchette”) as a means of communicating with deities, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and deceased leaders. While it was already a widespread practice in many different religious contexts, it was only in the 1820s to 1840s that spirit-writing gained currency in Xiantiandao. It became an essential means of religious text production and a source of legitimacy, especially regarding leadership and organization.
In contrast to Buddhist and Daoist clerics, Xiantiandao sectarians consider themselves lay practitioners, meaning that most live ordinary lives and maintain families. The sect is organized according to a hierarchy of eight ranks, but the exact number may vary depending on which subsect, region, and period one looks at. This system channels access to the sect’s teachings and practices, whereby higher-level (“esoteric”) teachings are only available to accomplished practitioners. The rank-holders at the top of the hierarchy are also responsible for the overall organization and translocal proselytization. In many subsects, the highest four ranks are only available to men. Yet, researchers found that many practitioners and even entire communities are female, especially in Southeast Asia. Thus, during most of the twentieth century, Xiantiandao “vegetarian halls” (zhaitang 齋堂) in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia served as safe havens for unmarried women who sought to evade male-dominated lives and for widows. In traditional Chinese societies, Confucian values of obedience and female subordination strongly compelled girls and women to marry and give birth to children. Accordingly, seeking refuge in a Xiantiandao temple and living a chaste religious life was a rare opportunity to evade male domination.
Because of the PRC’s strict religious policy and anti-sectarian agenda, Xiantiandao has almost disappeared from the Chinese mainland. Even though some communities survived in Taiwan and Southeast Asia and continued to thrive well into the twentieth century, ideological pressure from mainstream Buddhist groups led to a large-scale “Buddhisization” of Xiantiandao communities. Accordingly, many sites were converted into Buddhist monasteries and temples, and many sectarian practitioners formally became Buddhist monastics.",1734,2024,2291,1595,Nikolas Broy,2024-03-05 16:15:38.348 +0100,2024-03-05 16:15:38.348 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2237,"Order of Preachers, Dominicans, Friars Preachers, Black Friars, Jacobins",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Dominicans (officially called the Order of Preachers) are a Roman Catholic mendicant order founded at the start of the thirteenth century in France by Saint Dominic, a priest and cathedral canon from Old Castile. The Order is known as the Jacobins in France (where their first house was dedicated to Saint James), the Black Friars in the British Isles and Ireland (after the black mantle or cappa worn over their white habit), the Friars Preachers, Domini canes “the dogs of the Lord” or “watchdogs of orthodoxy” (because of the role they played in Church Inquisitions), or simply the Dominicans. The order has its origins in a diplomatic mission to Denmark during which Saint Dominic, alongside Diego, Bishop of Osma, encountered the Albigensian heresy in southern France en route to northern Europe. Having completed their mission in Denmark and inspired to join the Danish missionary activity and conversion efforts among the Baltic peoples, the two went to Rome so that Diego might tender his episcopal resignation. Both were instead sent instead by Pope Innocent III to tackle the Albigensian (Cathar) heresy in southern France beginning at Montpellier. Dominic and Diego enjoyed success in their mission among the Cathars. When Diego returned to his diocese in 1207, Dominic sought to establish an order to develop competent, educated preachers who could argue convincingly against heresy. Since its inception, the Order’s mission is specifically devoted to preaching, study, and education, eschewing manual labour in favour of a direct focus on spiritual work through rigorous intellectual discipline. In a similar fashion to other mendicant orders such as the Franciscans, the Friars Preachers are active in urban centres and embrace corporate poverty. The Order expanded rapidly throughout the medieval and early modern periods. The Order established religious houses and institutions for clerical education (studia generalia) in a great many university cities and towns; the Dominicans established houses in centres of education like Paris and Oxford deliberately to attract university students to the Order. Influential Dominicans include Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great, Margaret of Hungary, Raymond of Penyafort, Meister Eckhart, Catherine of Sienna, Rose of Lima, and Martin de Porres, among many other notable figures.",1217,2024,2332,1422,John Gallagher,2024-03-06 13:19:42.639 +0100,2024-03-10 20:31:42.483 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2242,Kato Panagia,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The monastery of Kato Panagia, dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, is located a few kilometers outside Arta in the foothills of Peranthi. The monastery’s location marks the entry to a mountainous road crossing part of Pindos by passing through Panagia Vellas (Red Church) in Vourgareli and terminating at the monastery of Porta Panagia, in Pyli near Trikala, where the illegitimate son of despot Michael Komnenos Doukas II (1231-1267/8), John I Doukas (1268-1289) took the monastic vow in 1283 (Kato Panagia and Porta Panagia are linked architecturally). The katholikon dates to the mid-thirteenth century, with evidence of its dating coming from the frescoes in the diaconicon. Monk Job Melias Iasites also mentions the building in the Vita of Saint Theodora (thirteenth century). The founder of the katholikon is believed to have been despot Michael Komnenos Doukas II (1231-1267/8), who constructed the foundation as an expression of repentance for his unfaithful behavior towards his wife, Theodora Petraliphaina, with a woman named Gangrene. Theodora was a beloved figure in Arta, as attested in her Vita. The exterior north façade of the katholikon has two ceramic inscriptions, of which one mentions the founder as Michael Komnenos Doukas II and includes a brick monogram of his. George Velenis has suggested a different reading of the monogram, offering the hypothesis that it refers to Archbishop of Ohrid Demetrios Chomatenos (1216-1236). Velenis proposes that Michael Komnenos Doukas II and Chomatenos built the monastery. The second inscription has two verses, of which the first is not fully intact (Anastasios Orlandos and Georgios Velenis offer different readings). Beyond the two inscriptions on the north façade, a third one is inscribed on a rock in the western pillar, including the word repentance (μετανοίας) next to what has been suggested to be the despot’s name.

The katholikon is a three-aisled cross-vault basilica with a narthex. Scholars agree that a workshop from northern Greece constructed the monastery, as evidenced by its exterior ceramic ornamentation, which includes meanders, sun motifs, and wave crest patterns. The monastery was damaged in the revolutions of 1821 and 1854, resulting in the partial loss of its book collection and the burning of some of its cells. The diaconicon and fragments in the lower register of the nave are the only remnants from the mid-thirteenth-century decoration. The bust of Christ (Ancient of Days) appears on a quadrant of the conch’s ceiling, and Saint Meletios and Saint Nikephoros flank its two-lobed window. The scene of Jesus teaching in the Temple decorates the northern part of the diaconicon’s arch. Jesus appears larger than the rest of the figures. The southern part includes the portrayal of Prophet Zechariah along with the inscription “ἀποδιώκων τὰ δῶρα τῶν δικαίων,” in which the Prophet rejects the gifts of the righteous. The walls of the diaconicon include renderings of full-sized saints (Saint Eleftherios, Saint Modestos, Saint Ypatios, Saint Oikoumenios, Saint Anthimos, and Saint Gregory the Illuminator) with their right hand in a blessing gesture, while with their left hand, they are holding a closed Evangelion. The rest of the frescoes date from 1715. The frescoes in the sanctuary’s apse date from 1857 according to an inscription; however, some appear to have been drawn over older ones. The western façade of the monastery also includes later frescoes with scenes from the Second Coming, the Old Testament, and painted icons. The original marble templon was replaced in 1831. Over the northern door, there is an inscription dating to 1876. The interior includes capitals, which may be spolia from Roman Amvrakia. The icons of Saint John the Forerunner (1699) and Christ Enthroned with Apostles (1678) were each created by the Cretan painters Georgios Nomikos and Emmanuel Tzanes. Several documents mention the monastery, including a document of the Metropolitan of Arta Seraphim Xenopoulos in the fifteenth century, a sigillion of Patriarch Ieremia II (1578), and a sigillion of Patriarch Raphael II (1604). Throughout time, the monastery appears to have been extremely wealthy, possessing landholdings, monasteries, villages, and a port in Salaora.",1250,2024,2300,1487,Sofia Pitouli,2024-03-09 08:24:28.421 +0100,2024-03-09 08:24:28.421 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2244,"Catholicism in the Latin Empire, Catholicism in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium), the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople",43,Religious Group (v6),"Catholicism was established in the Eastern Roman Empire following the Sack of Constantinople by the forces of the Fourth Crusade (AD 1202–1204). The Crusaders initially intended to recapture Jerusalem (via Egypt), which had fallen to the Muslim Ayyubids in AD 1187.  Due to financial pressures, organisers of the Crusade diverted from their course to help the deposed Byzantine prince, Alexius Angelos, who promised financial backing; once Alexius IV Angelos was crowned co-emperor alongside his previously deposed father, Isaac II Angelos (who was unexpectedly released from imprisonment), it became clear that the promise of support could not be upheld. Therefore, the Latins executed both co-regnants, violently sacked Constantinople, and assumed control of the Byzantine Empire. In this surprising turn of events, Catholicism was established where it had not held sway before. Byzantine territories were divided up, in a process referred to as “partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae”, between the Republic of Venice which was behind the initial campaign, leaders of the Crusade, and the Latin Empire, which established its seat at Constantinople. Although the Latin Empire laid claim to the vassal states it established in Greece and northern Thrace, it really only exerted control in eastern Thrace and Bithynia. It was in these regions of the Eastern Empire that Catholicism obtained.

Installation of the French crusader, Baldwin of Flanders as Emperor Baldwin I led contemporary Byzantines to dub this new form of rule the “Frankokratia” (rule of the Franks) or “Latinokratia” (rule of the Latins). The new Crusader state was not referred to as the “Latin Empire” by Latin contemporaries, but as “Romania” (territory of the Romans) or “Imperium Constantinopolitanum.” It is worth noting that “Byzantium” is a later appellation and that Byzantines in the Middle Ages referred to their polity as “Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων” (Basileía tōn Rhōmaíōn) and to themselves as “Ῥωμαῖοι” (Rhōmaîoi). In diplomatic documents, titles in Greek and Latin were used on an equal footing. The Latin emperors, Baldwin and his successors, asserted their authority as imperator (emperor) over both the Romaniae (i.e. Byzantines) and Romanorum (i.e. Romans). 

The failure of the Fourth Crusade, which never reached either Egypt or Jerusalem, led to a unique phase in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire in which Catholicism superseded Orthodoxy in terms of religious authority and dominance. Unsurprisingly, the Latin Empire and its Church faced resistance from Byzantines who identified with Orthodoxy. 

The Latin Empire attempted to adopt a framework of governance that paid deference to both eastern and western ideologies, seeking continuity and assimilation through the use of Byzantine titles and rituals. The Latin Emperor was crowned according to a modified Byzantine coronation ritual. Notwithstanding this religious-political gesture, the new regime placed Catholicism front and centre: Catholic structures replaced Orthodox equivalents throughout the territories it controlled (cf. the replacement of Orthodoxy with Catholicism in Sicily). While Byzantine bishops and clergy continued, the new outpost of the Catholic Church introduced a Latin Patriarch and Catholic episcopal hierarchy, clergy, and religious orders. Orthodox Greek Christians resisted imposed Latinisation, but some compromise was achieved. Pope Innocent III ordered Latins to show tolerance to Orthodox rites, although the divisive matter of papal authority was never questioned. Orthodoxy was not suppressed by the Latins per se, although attempts to enforce obedience to the papacy were sometimes aggressive and obedience to the Latin Patriarch was required. The Pope and the leaders of the Latin Empire probably hoped for unity and expected that Orthodox Christians and clergy would be absorbed into the Catholic Church. On the ground, Latins who settled in the empire practiced Catholicism while Byzantines continued to practice Orthodoxy. 

The Great Schism had created an unbridgeable gulf between Catholic and Orthodox Christians and dogmatic issues (e.g. the filoque) that could not easily be ameliorated. The Sack of Constantinople, and the looting and desecration of churches by the Latins, was brutal. This had a significant impact on how the seismic change in the religious landscape was received and negotiated. Matters were further compounded by internal tensions between the Latin Patriarch (Thomas Morosini was the first) and the Latin Emperor, both of whom were appointed by different stakeholders.

The shift was significant, but ultimately short-lived: Constantinople was eventually recaptured in 1261 by Byzantines following decades of strife between the Latin Empire and the neighbouring Bulgarian and Nicaean empires. Areas of the Mediterranean remained under Latin control until modern times and in such areas a Catholic presence persisted. However, the lasting effects of Catholicism in the region were limited. The Latin Patriarchate continued after 1261, but with responsibility for Catholics in the remaining parts of Latin Greece.

2249,Basilica of Saint Epiphanios,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Built in the late 4th or the early 5th century, the Basilica of Saint Epiphanios is located in ancient Salamis, 8 km north of the city of Famagusta (Ammochostos in Greek), on the east coast of the island of Cyprus. The Basilica is currently in a ruinous state. It was founded by Saint Epiphanios, Bishop of Constantia, precisely during the last years of his episcopacy (367-403), but it was completed by his successor, Savvinos. Although currently the monument it is known under the name of its founder, who was buried therein, there is no evidence regarding its original dedication.
The timber-roofed, seven-aisled basilica with the tripartite sanctuary replaced a smaller church. The basilica included in the east also a baptistery with a cruciform baptismal font and a hypocaust system for warming the water, a complex of halls (east), a narthex terminating into a semi-circular inscribed apse and an atrium (not yet excavated), while the north and south sides of the nave had adjunct narrow corridors running parallel to them, communicating with them via doors and possibly windows as well. These were believed to have been the areas used by those who were not baptized (katechoumena). In the 6th century, following an earthquake, the basilica was repaired, becoming at this phase a five-aisled building.
The Life of Saint Epiphanios mentions that he was buried on the right side of the basilica, with the permission of Emperor Arcadius, despite the fact that the building was not yet finished. This was confirmed by the excavated tomb at the eastern part of the second south aisle, lined with marble. Following the Arab raids of the 7th century, the basilica was rebuilt and so the tomb of the Saint was incorporated into the narthex of the new building. However, only part of his relics remained in the basilica, which continued to be an important centre of pilgrimage up to the 14th century. His relics were later transferred to the church of Saint Symeon in the nearby city of Famagusta. The second timber-roofed basilica with the synthronon, of much smaller dimensions, was erected to the east of the south aisles of the first basilica, probably between 653 and 690. The second timber-roofed basilica was replaced in the 8th century by a three-aisled, barrel-vaulted church carrying three domes on the central axis. This was the first example of a church belonging to the type of the multi-domed churches encountered in Cyprus. During the Lusignan period side apses were added to the church, while the tomb of Saint Epiphanios was also repaired. The monument was last repaired in the 16th century.
Following the first trial excavation of 1890 by the Archaeological Expedition of the British Museum, excavations were undertaken through the 20th century. In 1926 was excavated the nave, under the direction of George Jeffery. Andreas Dikigoropoulos has led the excavations which have taken place during the period 1954-1959.",370,2024,2333,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-03-10 09:21:47.405 +0100,2024-03-16 10:23:56.854 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2250,"The Monastery of Vatopaidi, Mount Athos",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastery of Vatopaidi is considered as the largest group of buildings in both area and volume on the monastic community of Mount Athos. Hence, from the very first years of its existence it has borne the title of the Megiste (’very great’) Monastery of Vatopaidi. In 11th century documents it is encountered as the ‘Lavra of Vatopaidi’, while in documents of the 14th century is encountered as ‘the Great Monastery of Vatopaidi’. Nowadays, the monastery is home to the largest brotherhood amongst the twenty ruling monasteries with well over a hundred monks. The Monastery of Vatopaidi stands on a picturesque stretch of coastline on the gulf of the same name and almost in the center of the north-eastern side of the Athos peninsula. According to the tradition, the monastery was built by the Emperor Constantine the Great (324-337), was subsequently destroyed by Julian the Apostate (361-363) and was re-founded by the Emperor Theodosius the Great (379-395) as a thank-offering to the Blessed Virgin for saving his son Arcadius from certain death by drowning when, as a child, he was in peril in a rough sea near Mount Athos. Arcadius was carried in a miraculous way to the shore, where the sailors found him sleeping near a bramble bush. According to the same tradition, during the 10th century Arab pirates looted and burnt down the monastery, slaughtering the monks and taking away with them to Crete as a prisoner the sacristan, the deacon-monk Sabbas. The biographer of St. Athanasius the Athonite, who lived during the second half of the 10th century mentions three nobles from Adrianople: Athanasius, Nicholas and Antonius that have a direct link with Vatopaidi. The three of them came to Athos with their fortunes, which amounted to 9,000 gold pieces, with the intention of founding a monastery. St. Athanasius, knowing that the monastery of Vatopaidi was in ruins because of the incursion of the pirates, sent them there to restore it. In fact, in a document dated ca. 985, is found the signature of the monk Nicholas as abbot of the monastery. The subsequent growth of the monastery was rapid: in the Typikon of Monomachus (1045), the monastery held the second place in the hierarchy of all the monasteries of Mount Athos, a position which it has retained until the present. It also gained the right to take part in the Synaxis in Karyes in the person of its abbot and four delegates, to keep a yoke of oxen to ensure bread supplies and to have a boat for its needs. At the end of the 12th century, the former prince of Serbia Symeon Nemanja and his son, Savvas, subsequently the first Archbishop and Ethnarch of Serbia, were monks in Vatopaidi. The presence of these two saints lent great prestige both to the monastery and to Mount Athos as a whole. St. Savvas took part in official missions to Constantinople in order to settle issues concerning the Athonite monastic community. It was on his request that the monastery ceded to the Serbian saints the apiary of Chelandari, so that they could build the Serbian monastery of that name. Their presence at Vatopaidi and their benefactions to it were always to remain in the memory of the Serbian people, and all the Serbian princes served as its protectors and benefactors. It was during the time of St. Sabbas that the monastery flourished as never before or after. It had as many as 800 monks, extended its buildings, thanks to the efforts of the two saints, and founded five new chapels on the site. With the founding of the Chelandari Monastery, a kind of spiritual affinity between the two brotherhoods developed. After the unsuccessful attempt of the Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus (1259-1282) to bring about the reunion of the Eastern and Western Churches at the Council of Lyons (1271), the monastery suffered fresh tribulations. According to the tradition, when the supporters of the union returned from Lyons, they invaded Mount Athos and attempted to force the monks to embrace their views. The refusal of the Vatopaidi brotherhood resulted in the hanging of the Abbot Euthymius and the drowning of 12 monks in the bay of Kalamitsi, as well as the hanging of the Protos of Karyes, St. Cosmas of Vatopaidi. Shortly afterwards, however, with the aid of the Palaeologues, the monastery recovered. Andronicus II (1282-1328) regarded it as the first and the glorious and provided it with financial support, so that it could return to its former prosperity and state. Throughout its history the monastery has attracted certain major ascetics, most prominent among which were St. Gregory Palamas, the great hesychast theologian, and his teacher St. Nicodemus, St. Joasaph of Meteora, and St. Sabbas, the holy fool, whose life was written by his pupil St. Philotheus, Patriarch of Constantinople. These were followed by St. Macarius Makris, who became the abbot of the Pantocrator Monastery in Constantinople (1431), while during the early years of Turkish rule it sheltered for a while the former Ecumenical Patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius. Around 1500, another Patriarch of Constantinople, St. Niphon, accompanied by his disciples the martyrs Macarius and Joasaph, betook himself to the monastery. It was at this period also that St. Maximus the Greek, the great missionary to the Russians, was a monk at Vatopaidi. According to a testimony of this latter, the monastery at that time followed a semi-coenobitic way of life. The foundation of the Athonite School (the so-called Athonias academy) in 1748 was Vatopaidi’s greatest contribution to the interests of the enslaved nation. The building of the school and its operation were fully undertaken by the monastery, during a period when it faced major economic problems because of the crippling taxation imposed by the Turkish authorities. The Athonite School was the biggest Greek school in the Greek world under Turkish occupation, reaching ca. 200 students. Its first director was the hierodeacon Neofytos Kafsokalyvitis. After the resignation of Neofytos, Evgenios Voulgaris became the director, while the teachers included the hierodeacons Kyprianos Kyprios, afterwards Patriarch of Alexandria (1766-1783), Nikolaos Tzertzoulis and Panayotis Palamas. Among the more famous of the school’s pupils were St. Cosmas of Aetolia, Righas Ferraios, the scholar and writer Sergios Makraios, the teacher losipos Misiodax, and the theologian Athanasios of Paros. St. Nicodemus the Athonite and Adamantios Koraes were among those who toiled to ensure its smooth operation. Vatopaidi has a history of supporting various causes and has continued in more modern times to generously provide alms. In 1880, the monastery donated 3,700 pounds for the building of the Great School of the Nation and in 1908 offered 5,000 pounds to the Theological School of Chalki. A crucial point in the monastery’s recent history was its re-manning in 1987 by a group of monks led by the elder Joseph Spilaiotis, from Agiou Pavlou Monastery’s Nea Skete. Moreover, following a resolution on the part of the fathers of the monastery and with a sigillium from the late Ecumenical Patriarch, Demetrius I, in 1989 the monastery returned, after the elapse of centuries, to the coenobitic system. Archimandrite Ephraim was elected as first Abbot, and his enthronement took place on the Second Sunday after Easter (29 April) 1990.",950,2024,2334,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,2024-03-10 09:28:58.344 +0100,2024-03-13 19:23:09.496 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2252,Monastery of Saint Herakleidios,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Monastery of Saint Herakleidios is located near the ancient/late antique city of Tamasos (Nicosia district), in Cyprus. Saint Herakleidios was initially a pupil of Apostles Paul, Barnabas, who later ordained him as the first Bishop of Tamasos. He had played a significant role in the proliferation and the spread of Christianity in Cyprus, and he is thus considered one of the most important local Saints. The Vita of Saint Herakleidios (end of the 5th century) mentioning cells and vigils at the place where he lived, suggests the establishment and existence of a monastery. Apart from this written evidence and the excavated remains dating back to the early Byzantine period, there is not any further evidence to support the presence of a coenobium in the area. Much later, in 1201, the abbot and founder of the Monastery of the Virgin of Machairas, mentions in his Testament (Typikon), that a monastery was established in the area of Tamasos. He furthermore indicates that this was a female monastery dedicated to Panagia Vlachernitissa. However, the exact location of this Monastery is unknown, as well as whether there was any connection with the Monastery of Saint Herakleidios, which at the time was a male monastery. The lease of 1850, after Saint Herakleidios was dissolved, mentions that the Archbishopric of Cyprus rented its land estates to different individuals, both clergy and laity. During this period, the church and the various buildings of the Monastery had suffered heavy damage. Saint Herakleidios was restored in the early 1960s and started functioning as a female monastery in 1962. 
The excavations conducted in 1963 by the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus have shown that a large three-aisled, timber-roofed basilica with mosaic floor was erected at the beginning of the 8th century, over a 5th-century column basilica. The first basilica was erected next to the mid-4th century martyrium, which was believed to house the tomb of the Saint. The basilica of the 5th century was destroyed in the 7th century, probably during the Arab raids. From the first basilica only the south pier arcades have survived, as well as fragments from the mosaic floors. The arcades were incorporated within the church of smaller dimensions built at the beginning of the 8th century. They were decorated with frescoes and based on that evidence they were dated to the 8th century. In the 11th century the church was decorated again with frescoes. The second basilica was in use throughout the Medieval period and it was destroyed some time before the 14th century. A new domed mausoleum was built over the Saint’s tomb in the Lusignan period, and a single-aisled vaulted church was erected in the 15th century over the nave. The present north aisle (erected over the original north aisle) and the narthex (the present portico) were added in the 17th century. Further alterations were made in the 18th century, when the katholikon (main church) was renovated. Finally, the katholikon was as well decorated with frescoes in the 18th century, as mentioned by the inscription of the south wall.
During the Medieval period a hagiographic workshop was operating at Saint Herakleidios Monastery with a rich and well attested production of panel paintings (icons). To the workshop is also attributed the decoration of many churches on the island. In particular, the production of icons during the 18th century is well documented, since we know that a group of painters (monks Nektarios and Filaretos, deacons Lavrentios and Leontios, and Archimandrites Filaretos and Leontios) was formed around monk Ioannikios, the teacher. The workshop remained active until the early 19th century.",400,2024,2336,1178,Marina Toumpouri,2024-03-11 20:19:28.235 +0100,2024-03-16 10:18:52.313 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2254,The Megali Panagia (Dormition of the Virgin),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of the Megali (Great) Panagia is located southwest of Paramythia, a town in Thesprotia, Epirus. The church is a three-aisled domical-vaulted church (the domical vault has an east-west orientation) with a narthex (separated by a pair of columns and not a wall), and a later exonarthex, portico (L-shaped), and gynaikonites (women’s gallery). The apse, which is semicircular on the inside and three-sided on the outside (like the Monastery of the Panagia Vlacherna in Arta), was once decorated by a two-lobed window in the middle and one single-lobed window at the sides (currently closed). The prothesis has a thin two-lobed window, while its shape is semicircular inside and outside. A two-story building stands at the south end of the exonarthex, accessible only through the gynaikonites. The purpose of this space was to store reliquaries. Based on the church’s brickwork decoration (dogtooth, zigzag, fishtail, and other) found on the exterior façades––a common feature of Epirote churches––scholars date it to the second half of the 13th century (dated after the construction of the monastery of Kato Panagia and the church of Hagia Theodora in Arta). The church’s masonry includes layers of continuous horizontally placed stones separated by single bricks. The slots between the horizontal stones are secured by inserting two vertical bricks. This architectural feature is common in churches built during the early decades of the Despotate of Epirus, which further supports the church’s dating to the 13th century. Entry to the church happens through the west side of the narthex. There are three additional doors in the church: two at the nave (one on the north wall and one on the south) and one door on the south wall of the diaconicon, constructed after the creation of the church. The church also includes two inscriptions dating to 1804 and 1858. The first is inscribed on a slab placed in the lintel of an opening that leads to the nave by passing through the north portico. The second inscription appears on a slab on the west wall of the west wing of the portico and it is in relief. Only a limited number of frescoes survive today; however, plaster survives on the walls and domes of the church. In the west section of the portico, parts of the old floor remain. The floor is composed of large rectangular plaques and smaller ones of unruly shape. Beyond its architectural importance, the church preserved relics and several objects. The relics of Saint Spyridon and Saint Theodora of Augusta were housed at the church in 1453, a few years before their transfer to Corfu, where they are venerated to this day. A gold-embroidered epitaphios textile created by the skilled monk Arsenios in 1578 also belonged to the church. Today, the church is dedicated to the Dormition of the Virgin and is the cemetery church of the town; nevertheless, throughout its life, it held the status of an episcopal church and a katholikon of a monastery. In a sigillion of Patriarch Neophytos III, written in 1636, the church is mentioned as Panagia of Paramythia. The church includes in its collection a gospel, vestments, sacred vessels, and books. Archaeologists have discovered the ruins of a Byzantine bath located 100 meters north of the katholikon.",1250,2024,2339,1487,Sofia Pitouli,2024-03-13 20:47:13.133 +0100,2024-03-13 20:47:13.133 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2260,Church of Hagios Athanasios tou Mouzaki (of Mouzaki),50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of Hagios Athanasios tou Mouzaki (οf Mouzaki) is located in the city of Kastoria, Greece. The church is a single-aisle basilica with a timber roof (later addition). This architectural plan is a preferred one for churches constructed during the Byzantine era and the subsequent post-Byzantine period in Kastoria. At a later time, the church received a narthex. Based on the donor’s inscription over the entry door, the church dates to 1383/84. The brothers Stoya and Theodore ΙΙ Mouzaka (sons of Andrea II Mouzaka) and the hieromonk Dionysius, under the bishop of Kastoria Gabriel, were responsible for its construction. The fresco decoration of the church survives in good condition. The Virgin Platytera, who raises her hands in the orans position while child Christ is in front of her, decorates the semicircular dome of the apse. Below the Virgin appears the Communion of the Apostles, and underneath the Melismos of Christ and four hierarchs, Saints Gregory the Theologian, Basil the Great, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nyssa, who appear in the lower zone of the apse. At the same height as the hierarchs, within a semicylindrical arch appears the deacon Saint Stephen, and next is Simeon the Stylite. The scene of the vision of Saint Peter of Alexandria (including an epigraph) occupies entirely the lower section of the northern wall, next to Saint Stephen and Simeon the Stylite. On the other side appears Saint Cyril of Alexandria, while adjacent to the saint, on the southern wall next to the sanctuary, appears Saint Clement of Ohrid and Saint Achilles of Larissa. The upper zone of the apse is framed by the narrative of the Annunciation, which includes the Virgin, Archangel Gabriel, Prophet Habakkuk, and a second unidentified prophet. The narration continues to the southern wall next to the sanctuary, where the Nativity appears, followed by the Ypapanti, Baptism, the Raising of Lazarus, and the Palm Bearers. The Transfiguration, Prophet Zacharias, and David occupy the pediment of the west wall (upper zone, over the entry and epigraph, and across the apse). Below the scene appears the Dormition of the Virgin as well as the trial of the High Priests and the triple denial of Peter. The northern wall includes Christ Elkoomenos, the Crucifix, the Lamentation, the Myrrh-bearers at the tomb, and the Descent into Hades. The narration terminates over the Virgin Platytera in the scene depicting the Ascension of Christ. The scenes developing in the nave (including the aforementioned narrative scenes) appear within superimposed zones, outlined by red frames. A zone with encircled busts divides the upper and lower sections of the south and north walls. The south wall depicts those of Saint Dionysius, Saint Gregory Akragantos, Saint Ypatios, Saint Efstratios, Saint Auxentios, Saint Eugenios, Saint Mardarios, Saint Ananias, Saint Azarias, Saint Misael, Saint Arethas, Saint Sergios, and Saint Bacchus. The north wall depicts the busts of Saint Julitta, Saint Cyricus, Saints Manuel, Savel, and Ismael, Saint Alexios, Saint Vincent, Saint Menas, Saint Victor, two unidentified female saints, Saints Cosmas and Damian, Saint Germanos, Saint Polykarpos, and Saint Ignatius. In the lower zone of the southern wall, next to the renderings of Saint Clement of Ohrid and Saint Achilles of Larissa, and below an archway, appears Saint Athanasios––the saint that this church is dedicated to. Next to him appears the Archbishop Nicholas of Myra. The rest of the southern wall is adorned with complete depictions of military saints, including Saint Demetrios, Saint Theodore Tiron, Saint Theodore Stratelates, Saint Prokopios, and Saint Mercurius. The entryway is flanked on one side by the renderings of Saints Constantine and Helen while on the other by Archangel Michael and Saint Barbara. The lower zone of the northern wall includes the figures of Saint Nicholaos and Saint Alexandros, followed by the fragmentary smaller-scale renderings of Saint Paraskevi and Saint Kyriaki. After these, there is an unidentified saint, Saint George, the Deesis, and Saint John the Forerunner.",1383,2024,2346,1487,Sofia Pitouli,2024-03-15 21:08:45.906 +0100,2024-03-15 23:42:54.383 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2264,The Puritans,43,Religious Group (v6),"Puritanism was a Protestant reform movement that sought to ""purify"" the Church of England of lingering Roman Catholic ""popery."" As a term, ""puritan"" first emerged in England in the 1560s as an insult against ministers and laypeople who deviated from the orthodoxy of England's church. Puritans believed they were God's ""elect"" according to the Calvinist principle of predestination. They emphasized that a covenantal relationship with God was essential for the erasure of sins. This relationship came on the heels of an initial conversion experience that was emotionally, spiritually, and personally impactful. Salvation was thereafter administered to the saints by their preaching and testifying in partnership with the Holy Spirit: salvation's active instrument. Not to be confused with the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony who were theologically separatist from the established church and had ties to Holland, Puritans originally sought reform within the Church of England as non-separatists. Espousing ideas from Calvinism, Puritans perceived themselves as the predestined elect who were tasked to usher in the material Kingdom of God on earth. They promoted strict moral behaviour, presbyterian eldership of churches, and literacy for the sake of widespread Biblical teaching, preaching, and proselytization. Puritans perceived themselves in a similar light to the Jews as God's chosen but persecuted elect. Those who migrated to North America were among the more radical Puritan thinkers who were dissatisfied with the episcopal polity of the state church. Shunned for their congregational ideologies in England and outspoken criticisms, these ""separatist"" Puritans, dissatisfied with the church's stagnation and corruption, migrated from the regions of East Anglia and greater London to realize their ideal of a Holy Commonwealth in the New World. As ""visible"" saints, these individuals withdrew themselves from English cities to institute self-proclaimed cities of God on the ""untouched"" and ""pure"" shores of North America. The early seventeenth century saw waves of Puritans making the dangerous transatlantic crossing. However, unlike earlier migration movements where single young men dominated population outflows, families comprised the majority of Puritan migrants. With men immigrating to North America with their wives and children, settlers quickly outgrew their initial settlements and spread into the adjacent areas of the northeast. As God's elect who were chosen to live and model godly lives both individually and communally, more colonies formed and grew into what eventually became Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine. By the early eighteenth century, the dissenting nature of Puritanism inevitably led to its own fragmentation as a homogenous group. Its ideals and ideologies were grafted into the tenets of Quakers, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and other Protestant evangelical groups. Although Puritanism itself disappeared by the mid-eighteenth century, Puritans' characteristic moral rigour, self-reliance, and political localism remained distinctive amongst American colonists.",1560,1720,2350,1560,Bethany Henderson,2024-03-19 19:07:34.654 +0100,2024-04-03 15:33:55.443 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2266,Yangsheng Daoism from Laozi to Ge Hong,43,Religious Group (v6),"Early Daoist studies has two main schools of thought: associated with Chinese scholarship, the first holds that Laozi 老子 was born circa 571 BC and that he composed the Daodejing 道德經; associated with Western scholarship, the second holds that Laozi never lived and that the Daodejing was anonymously compiled from existing sources around 250 BC. Because views that argue for the existence of Laozi and his “authorship” of the Daodejing are relatively scarce in Western studies, this entry supports the former views, namely by maintaining Laozi’s historical existence and his central involvement with the earliest circulations of the Daodejing, but it also departs from them in some significant ways. Developing these views opens new ways to understand early Daoist groups and their commitment to the teachings of the Daodejing.
	By the beginning of the Warring States, the Daodejing was already circulating in certain Daoist interpretive communities. Given that their understandings of the text’s philosophy of the Dao were not identical, their commitment to it nevertheless united them in ways that justify the application of the Daoist label to them. These groups included Yangsheng Daoists 飬生道, who prioritized the practice of the Daodejing’s teachings of bodily cultivation called yangsheng 飬生 (nourishing life); Fangxian Daoists 方仙道, who modified yangsheng from a self-directed cultivation to an other-directed therapeutic or medical tradition; Zuowang Daoists 坐忘道, who supported the Daodejing’s philosophy of the Dao but who distanced themselves from yangsheng bodily cultivation in favor of the zuowang 坐忘 spiritual cultivation that was endorsed by the Xinshu 心術 texts from the Guanzi 管子 as well as the Zhuangzi 莊子; and Huang-Lao Daoists 黄老道, who absorbed zuowang spiritual cultivation even as they transformed the Daodejing’s original phenomenology of the Dao into a metaphysics. Of these four titles, only Fangxian Daoism and Huang-Lao Daoism are directly recognized in the contemporary historical sources, while Yangsheng Daoism and Zuowang Daoism are not, in part due to the relative absence of elitist writers who would recognized their existence, although later writers would collectively refer to these groups as Lao-Zhuang 老莊; this is an important factor in the Western habit to deny their existence.  
	This entry focuses on Yangsheng Daoism as the original group that demonstrates a commitment to Laozi’s teachings on yangsheng as a self-directed bodily cultivation. As it is portrayed in several sections of the Zhuangzi and the Liexian zhuan 列仙傳, whose composition is traditionally attributed to Liu Xiang 劉向 (77-8 BCE), as well as throughout the two works of Ge Hong 葛洪 (283-343), the Baopuzi 抱朴子 and the Shenxian zhuan 神仙傳, the unique nexus of Yangsheng Daoism is its three-part structure: entering the mountains, becoming disciple to a Daoist master, and committing to the techniques of yangsheng to acquire long life. As a general term, yangsheng is synonymous with xingqi 行氣 (“qi circulation”), qigong 氣功 (“qi cultivation”), and tuna 吐納 or, more precisely, tugu naxin 吐古納新 (“to spit out the old and take in the new [qi]”), practices that are often set next to the postures and movements of daoyin 導引 (to push and pull), a kind of calisthenics often performed in imitation of animal behaviors, that intend to “push” the new qi throughout the body. Ge Hong, who repeatedly self-identified with this tradition of Laozi’s Daoism, presented its first systematic exposition. According to him, yangsheng as a a category marker consists of four relatively autonomous practices of bodily cultivation: xingqi; daoyin; sexual arts (房中之術 fangzhong zhi shu); and 服飯 fushi (dietetics) centered on 辟谷 bigu (grain avoidance). 
Although Yangheng Daoist writings represent yangsheng as having an ancient pedigree, its original textual demonstrations are found throughout the verses of the Daodejing without directly naming it. It is a term that many other Warring States texts variously used sometimes with meanings different from Laozi in contexts other than bodily cultivation, including the Guoyu 國語, Zhuangzi, Mengzi 孟子, Xunzi 荀子, Guanzi, Sunzi Bingfa 孙子兵法, and Lüshi Chunqiu 吕氏春秋. The term yangsheng gave rise to a collection of cognate terms, all which center on long life, including飬壽 yang shou, 飬長 yang chang, and 飬老 yang lao (nourishing long life),飬形 yang xing (nourishing the form),飬身 yang shen (nourishing the torso), 飬氣 yang qi (nourishing breath),飬己 yang ji (nourishing self),飬神 yang shen (nourishing spirit), 飬德 yang de (nourishing circulation or nourishing virtue),飬性 yang xing (nourishing nature),飬心 yang xin (nourishing heart-mind), and 飬耳目 yang ermu (nourishing ears and eyes). Yangsheng and related terms are found with more prevalence in the Han, and then became a staple term in a wide array of Chinese philosophical and medical writings thereafter. 
The writings of Yangsheng Daoism are noteworthy for their consistent application of yangsheng to techniques of bodily cultivation. In the Daodejing, Laozi concentrates on xingqi and daoyin but, at least on the surface, he has less to say about fangzhong zhi shu and bigu. The text presents the theoretical underpinnings of yangsheng by way of its phenomenology of the Dao; it states, for example, that “the Great Dao pervades everything, it goes round and round” (34). It also states, “Looked at but not seen, it is invisible; listened to but not heard, it is inaudible; reached for but not felt, it is intangible” (14). An important element of this phenomenology is the notion of qi, understandable as the breath of the Dao that serves as the very stuff of all life: being formless, it is the air that nourishes all beings; taking form, it is that which congeals to manifest the substantiality of all things and beings. The expansive (陽 yang) and contractive (隐 yin) movements of qi function together in systems of circulation that are applicable in many areas and are everywhere apparent: in atmospheric phenomena visible in the sky and the change of the seasons, in oceanic tides, in the veins of rocks and leaves and, in the context of yangsheng bodily cultivation, in the body’s numerous systems of circulation. 
	  Because human beings are an organic part of the world, our lives, together with all other living beings, are defined by qi; mirroring Laozi’s philosophy of the Dao, Zhuangzi Chapter 22 writes that “the accumulation of qi is life; its dispersal is death.” Yangsheng consists of the techniques that allow a person to prolong his or her life by expelling debilitative, exhausted qi from the body and replenishing it with vital, pristine qi. Xingqi is the fundamental method for this, especially when one absorbs air in its purest form as found on mountains; daoyin serves to circulate it throughout the body; fangzhong zhi shu lets people exchange and rebalance their qi either by taking yin and giving yang or taking yang and giving ying; and bigu concerns the foods and drinks that further empower or debilitate the body. Referring to these practices, Daodejing Chapter 22 states that “bending leads to intactness; twisting leads to straightness; depletion leads to renewal; reduction leads to increase.” Chapter 45 also states, “Great filling seems to be incomplete, yet its usefulness is never exhausted. Great straightening seems to be bent… Activity overcomes cold, tranquility overcomes heat, and calmness and tranquility regulate the world.”  
	Among various theories about the ancient origins of yangsheng, some point to an hunter-gather realization of the benefits of deep breathing to enhance physical strength and endurance, which is related to xingqi, while others emphasize the imitation of animal behaviors, thus raising shamanism as ancient precursor to yangsheng, especially in the context of Zhuangzi 15’s description of yangsheng masters who practice “bear-hangings and bird-stretches” and the Daoyintu’s 導引圖 visual representations of multiple other animal-based daoyin movements. The Daoist understanding of its origins is somewhat more complex since it sees yangsheng woven into the very fabric of existence. The Liexian zhuan, for example, recognizes a certain Rong Chengzi 容成子, already alive at the dawn of human existence, as the pioneering human who first discovered and understood it, but he did not invent it. He initially mastered fangzhong zhi shu, identified with the Mysterious Female (玄牝 xuanpin) and the Spirit of the Valley (毂神 gushen), which, towards the end of his long life, he personally taught to Laozi who himself directly named them in Daodejing Chapter 6. Ge Hong, writing about “the many hermits who honor the techniques of Laozi,” also does not recognize Laozi as the inventor of yangsheng but rather sees him as its greatest teacher who also composed the Daodejing. Further, because “the moisture of Laozi’s vast spring that has long flowed forth is abundant, abundant,” he further writes that Laozi was “established by Heaven and Earth as the teacher for ten thousand generations.”    
	From its earliest circulations, the Daodejing served as the orientational text for the Yangsheng Daoist nexus of entering the mountains, becoming disciple to a hermit master, and committing to yangsheng and the pursuit of longevity. Even if the earliest Daoist communities did not systematically fulfill this nexus in every way, considering it allows us to reconstruct the ways in which writings from Laozi to Ge Hong understood it. Accordingly, members of these mountainous communities shared a common goal in their pursuit of longevity by means of yangsheng, which they learned from yangsheng masters that the Daodejing refers to as sages (聖人 shengren). But because the term was also central to other political writings of the time whose circulations were far more widespread, in which sages systematically referred to rulers at the head of enlightened government, by the time of the Zhuangzi, Daoist writings began to embrace xian 仙 as a distinguished term for those who had achieved long life. It became a staple term in the Daoist lexicon of the Liexian zhuan, the Baopuzi, and the Shenxian zhuan, where it also absorbed the additional meaning of immortals for some of the xian. 
In addition to their mountainous communities committed to yangsheng, Yangsheng Daoists were also the original framers, editors, and interpreters of the teachings of the Daodejing, which in their earliest version likely took the form of oral teachings transmitted from masters to their disciples. During the early Warring States, some adherents successfully modified yangsheng from a self-directed bodily cultivation to an other-centered medical therapy, which they then exported to a wealthy clientele in society. As represented in texts such as the Shiji 史記, these medical professionals were called fangji 方技, and they belonged to a tradition called Fangxian Daoism whose practice, according to David Schaberg, combined yangsheng therapies with recitations of the Daodejing. These developments provide the deeper historical contexts for understanding Fangxian Daoism’s later and more sophisticated writings as seen, for example, in two of their texts unearthed from Zhangjiashan dated to 186 BCE, the Maishu 脈書 and Yinshu 引書), as well as the six unearthed from Mawangdui dated to 168 BCE, including the Daoyintu, Yangsheng fang 飬生方, Shiwen 十問, and He Yinyang 和陰陽, which Donald Harper has studied in great depth. 
This exposure of the Daodejing to elite members of society, albeit in originally medical contexts, drew the attention of learned philosophers as well as leading politicians, and it brought the text’s philosophy of the Dao to new levels of widespread familiarity. The first group that formed from this is called Huang-Lao Daoism, a separate tradition that formed around the middle of the Warring States. They distanced yangsheng teachings from the text’s philosophy of the Dao, and they went on to transform this philosophy from a phenomenology to a powerful metaphysics with starkly political overtones that was directed to the enlightened ruler. Their Dao was no longer at home in the world, but rather represented a transcendental entity that the ruler could mystically access; having done so, he was then empowered to translate the Dao’s eternal principles, including ziran 自然 and wuwei 無為, into his utopian Daoist government.
	Although historical records that would shed light on the continuation of the mountainous tradition of Yangsheng Daoism throughout the course of the Han are relatively scarce, the Liexian zhuan, standing as the first known collection of xian biographies, fills in this void. Consisting of some 72 xian biographies, only a handful are focused on Yangsheng Daoists, while the majority consist of fables and legends of those who acquired long life by means other than yangsheng; for example, one biography tells of a commoner who encountered a dragon with a toothache, and after extracting the tooth, the dragon gifted the person with long life. 
	The historical record concerning Yangsheng Daoism remains mostly quiet until Ge Hong’s Shenxian zhuan and Baopuzi. The former represents the second collection of xian biographies, around 80 depending on the edition, a handful of which are revised versions of biographies also found in the Liexian zhuan. The much larger number of its biographies concentrate on Yangsheng Daoists, many of which come with an innovative twist. Ge Hong presents the xian in two broad categories, namely dixian 地仙 and tianxian 天仙, with one subcategory identified with each. Virtually all these xian meet the criteria of the yangsheng nexus by entering the mountains where they find a teacher, either human or divine, under whom they master yangsheng and acquire long life. However, the dixian remain on the earth where they continue to reside in the mountains, except for the subcategory of householder xian who divide their time between their household and the mountains; this is exemplified in the biography of Peng Zu 彭祖. The tianxian, on the other hand, first master yangsheng and acquire long life before they graduate to the complex operations of alchemy and, after producing and ingesting a divine elixir, they acquire immortality and ascend directly into the heavens, where they are to positions in the celestial bureaucracy. The subcategory of tianxian is called shijie 屍解, referring to those xian who, after ingesting the elixir, ascend to the heavens “by way of release from the corpse.”
	Although yangsheng was given the highest priority in Ge Hong’s writings, they profoundly influenced later traditions of Daoist religion that prioritized alchemy, especially neidan 内丹 (inner alchemy) that was less concerned with laboratory operations than with a spiritualized form of transformation, but they did not meet the yangsheng nexus criteria; instead, their nexus was grounded in formal ordination into a specific order and was centered in temples and included large doses of devotional practices. Nonetheless, Yangsheng Daoism continued unabated, as even Michel Strickmann recognizes for the period of medieval China, although its adherents did not bequeath many records of their tradition or their mountainous lives. More recently, there have been a few modern studies of this tradition that do not specifically recognize it as Yangsheng Daoism as such, including Bill Porter’s Road to Heaven: Encounters with Chinese Hermits, which is a record of his encounters with Daoist mountain hermits. Another valuable contemporary contribution that, however, focuses on Daoist monastic communities residing on mountains is Dream Trippers: Global Daoism and the Predicament of Modern Spirituality by David Palmer and Elijah Siegler, but it also has valuable things to say about the Daoist mountainous hermit tradition.",-571,343,1183,1574,Thomas Michael,2024-03-20 04:45:25.849 +0100,2024-03-21 13:30:51.406 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2273,Yuan divination schools,43,Religious Group (v6),"Although some divination students were recorded in Dunhuang’s prefectural schools in the 10th century, it was in Yuan China that local divination schools were established by imperial order for the first time. From 1291 onward, Yuan rulers ordered the establishment of divination schools in various administrative units of the Yuan, from the route down to the subprefecture. Modeled on Confucian schools and medical schools, divination schools were headed by one or more divination instructors, selected for their expertise in divination. The highest ranked ones (9b) were appointed by the Directorates of Astronomy (sitiantai 司天臺) of the central bureaucracy while the lower-ranked ones were recommended by the locals. The Yuan divination school had multiple functions. First, they taught the three fundamental topics of divination (sanyuan 三元), namely geomancy of residence spaces (zhaiyuan 宅元), geomancy of burial site (yingyuan 塋元), and marriage divination (hunyuan 婚元). Second, they managed local diviners, organizing them for local services such as timekeeping. Third, they recommended qualified candidates to the Directorates of Astronomy, which had many activities related to various divination practices. Although not as systematically established as Confucian and medical schools (I have identified 150 divination schools according to the existence of school buildings or instructors), the divination school continued well into the Ming and the Qing periods. The institution’s connection to the Yuan divination households is not always clear. In some cases, the local divination school managed registered local divination households, while in other cases, the divination instructors did not necessarily come from a divination household. Some Yuan divination school instructors published books on the three fundamental topics of divination or on other divination practices, while others networked with local elites, prognosticating for them or writing stone inscriptions, etc. The establishment of local divination schools institutionalized the significance of the three fundamental topics of divination, in particular geomancy. It also strengthened divination instructors’ social status, making divination an alternative profession for traditional Confucian families.",1291,1368,2356,1603,Qiao Yang,2024-03-24 15:15:56.735 +0100,2024-03-24 21:25:36.914 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2274,Ìjọ Àdìmúlà (An Institutionalised Indigenous Religious Movement in Yorubaland,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ìjọ Àdìmúlà is a unified movement of Yoruba traditional religion that sprung up in Ile-Ife under the leadership of Olorunfemi Osiiga an Ìjẹ̀bú man in the 1920s. The term Ìjọ means assembly while Àdìmúlà means ""The Personality one can hold on to and be saved"". the term has been adopted to describe Yoruba religion. Ìjọ Àdìmúlà started as a secessionist movement from Ìjọ Àdìmúlà ti Kŕstì (which was a Christian denomination). It was noted that Osiiga's goal was to create a purely Yoruba traditional religious worship system which has since spread to other Yoruba communities of southwestern, Nigeria. Ìjọ Àdìmúlà came into existence in some other communities as a need for social coercion for members of Yoruba indigenous religion. It was noted that the prevalence of Christianity in those communities was gradually driving indigenous religion into extinction which calls for a drastic reaction from practitioners of indigenous religion to have a voice. Such communities include Ọ̀là, Màsífà, Òkò, Èjìgbò, Òsogbo, among others.  Ìjọ Àdìmúlà gained more prominence in Ìlé-Ifẹ̀, Ọ̀là, Màsífà, and several others within Osun State. The membership of the group is drawn from every Yoruba religious group such as Ifá, Sàngó, Ọya, Egúngún, Ògún, and Obàtálá among others. The group population varies from one community to the other. For instance, Ilé-Ifẹ̀ has an average population of 220, Ọ̀là 750, and Màsífà 630 with women and children inclusive. Some of the distinctive features of Ìjọ Àdìmúlà to the different Yoruba religious groups are the creation of structures within the system, the use of documented text that has unarguably been associated with Yoruba indigenous religion, and the introduction of public service within modernised buildings called Ilé Ìjùbà (worship centres) as opposed to worship in shrines and groves. It is important to note that the temple is regarded as a sacred place where the divinities abide, because of this notion reference is accorded to the temple demonstrated by individual putting off their shoes before entering into the temple. Also individuals bow themselves touching the floor with their forehead in reverence to the divinities believed to be present in the temple.
The group structures comprise both administrative and spiritual: the administrative includes alàgbà tàbí Àwọn Àgbàgbà Ìjọ (Elders), Ìgbìmọ̀ Ìjọ (Council of the assembly), Àwọn Akọ̀wé Ìjọ (Secretaries and Treasurers of the Assembly), Ẹgbẹ́ Amú Ìjọ dùn (which they interpreted as Deacons and Deaconess), Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdẹ (Security); while the spiritual involves Adarí Ìjọ/Olórí Ìjọ (Leader of the Assembly), Asọsẹ Ìjọ (Preacher), Àwọn Ẹgbẹ́ Akọrin Ifágbayé, Ifálólayọ̀, Òdòdó/Ìràwọ̀ Ọrúnmìlà (Choir groups for married women, single ladies and the children respectively who dress in their different regalia), among others.
The group days of worship differ from one community to the other. It was gathered that Ìjọ Àdìmúlà in Ilé-Ifẹ̀ worship on Sunday while those in Màsífà and Ọ̀là worship on Saturday. The form of worship was purely liturgical although it allows for a bit of flexibility. The leading personnel reads from the worship guide while the congregation listens and responds at the appropriate places.
The content of the worship guide begins with a call to worship, then a processional hymn, and salutations to Olódùmarè, followed by other òrìsà of Yoruba which includes all deities and Orí (destiny) which is often regarded as one of the most important personal òrìsà among the Yoruba. This is followed by Ìwúre Ìbẹ̀ẹ̀rẹ̀ Ìsìn (Opening prayer) and other features such as Ọ̀rọ̀ Ìwúrí (sermon), Ìdáwó (collection of plates), Ìdúpẹ́ (thanksgiving), Orin láti ọ̀dọ Àwọn Akọrin (choir renditions) among others. It should be noted that Ifá corpus that are documented in the worship guide forms the major text of every sermon, however, the preacher is at liberty to recite any Odù Ifá (Ifa verse) he or she deems necessary for his sermon and close the service with a congregational prayer. The group in each community also has àjọ̀dún which is specific annual festival that they hold in high esteem.",1920,2023,2357,1602,Ebenezer Elesemoyo,2024-03-24 23:45:26.201 +0100,2024-03-25 21:45:25.888 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2275,Luofu Shan,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"Known as the “Grand Mountain of the Yue Region (粤岳)” according to the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian 司馬遷, Mount Luofu 羅浮山 held great significance as a cultural hub in southern China. It was also revered as one of the foremost mountains in Chinese history and culture due to the rich history of a significant number of practitioners of Daoism and Buddhism, as well as Confucian scholars who lived, studied, taught, and practiced their doctrines there. During its heyday, Mount Luofu was recorded as a thriving center of “Nine Taoist Temples, Eighteen Buddhist Temples, and Twenty-two Hermitages (九觀十八寺二十二庵)”. The name of Mount Luofu has many legendary origins, with the most renowned myth recounting a tale from the immortal Penglai Mountain 蓬萊 where a peak named ""Fu Mountain (浮山)” resided. It was said that during the era of Emperor Yao, a period marred by widespread land inundation, the ""Fu Mountain"" from the sea drifted to the Lingnan region, where it collided with the pre-existing ""Luo Mountain (罗山)” and merged to become Mount Luofu. Geographically, Mount Luofu is situated in the northwest of Boluo County 博羅縣, Huizhou City 惠州市, Guangdong Province 廣東省, China. With a total area exceeding 260 square kilometers, its principal peak, Feiyun Peak 飛雲頂, stands at an elevation of 1,296 meters. Mount Luofu is renowned for its unique rock formations, majestic waterfalls, mystical caves, abundant rainfall, and lush vegetation, making it an ideal site for spiritual retreats, alchemical practices, and health cultivation among Daoist and Buddhist practitioners, scholars, literati, and common people throughout history.
According to historical records, as early as the Qin and Han dynasties, figures such as Zhu Lingzhi 朱靈芝, Ren Dun任敦, and Liang Lu 梁盧, among others, were captivated by the scenic beauty of Mount Luofu and delved into its mountains to pursue Daoist practices. During the Xianhe period 咸和 of the Eastern Jin dynasty, Ge Hong 葛洪, one of the most important and famous Daoist practitioners and theorists,  settled on Mount Luofu to engage in alchemical pursuits and established four Daoist temples: Baihe Temple 白鶴觀, Chongxu Temple 衝虛觀, Huanglong Temple 黃龍觀, and Sulao Temple 酥醪觀, recruiting disciples and conducting Daoist teachings. His wife, Baogu 鮑姑, and numerous disciples, including Teng Sheng 騰升, An Haijun 安海君, and Huang Yeren 黃野人 (who allegedly was one of the prototype of the famous healing deity Wong Tai Sin 黃大仙), significantly contributed to the development and dissemination of Daoism there. Entering the Sui dynasty, the renowned Daoist Su Yuanlang 蘇元朗 arrived at the Qingxia Valley 青霞谷 of Mount Luofu to cultivate Daoist practices. He elucidated the concept of  “dual cultivation of nature and life (性命雙修)” using the terminology of external alchemy 外丹 to explain internal alchemy 內丹, revitalizing the theory of internal alchemy and pioneering the trend of internal alchemy studies in the Tang and Song dynasties, exerting a profound influence on later Daoist developments. During the Tang dynasty, notable Daoist figures on Mount Luofu included Xuanyuan Ji 軒轅集, Shen Taizhi 申太芝, and Deng Yuanqi 鄧元起. In the Song dynasty, Mount Luofu continued to produce eminent Daoist scholars, such as Deng Shou’an 鄧守安, who had a close relationship with Su Dongpo 蘇東坡, as well as prominent “Southern School (南宗)” masters such as Shi Tai石泰, Chen Nan 陳楠, Bai Yuchan 白玉蟾, and Peng Si 彭耜. Among them, Bai Yuchan studied the methods of the “Nine Tripod Golden Elixir (九鼎金丹) ” with Chen Nan on Mount Luofu, later becoming one of the “Five Ancestors (五祖 )” of the Southern School of Daoism. The development of Daoism on Mount Luofu underwent significant transformations during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Previously associated with the “Lingbao Sect (靈寶派)”, in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the eleventh-generation successor of the “Quanzhen Longmen Sect (全真龍門派)” was appointed as the head of the five temples on Mount Luofu. During the Kangxi period 康熙, the Longmen Sect successor Du Yangdong 杜陽棟 assumed the position of head of the Chongxu Temple, establishing official regulations and transforming Mount Luofu into a sacred site of Daoism for the Longmen Sect. In the Daoist cosmology of “Grotto-Heavens and Blissful Lands (dongtian fudi 洞天福地) ”, Mount Luofu is ranked seventh among the “Ten Major Grotto Heavens” and is referred to as the “Grotto-heaven of Vermillion Brightness Shining Truth (Zhuming yaozhen tian 朱明耀真天)”. 
Mount Luofu is not only a celestial abode for Daoist cultivation but also a sacred site for Buddhism. As early as 359 AD, the Dunhuang monk Shandao 單道 arrived at Mount Luofu to engage in spiritual practice, marking the beginning of Mount Luofu's Buddhist history. According to the Official History of Guangdong (2007), by the end of the Jin Dynasty, approximately thirty Buddhist temples were built within the Guangdong region, with Panyu  County 番禺 having the most, followed by Mount Luofu.  Tang Dynasty was a flourishing period for the spread of Buddhism on Mount Luofu, during which eminent monks resided there, including Huaidi 懷迪 from Nanlou Monastery 南樓寺 who collaborated with Indian monks to translate the Lengyan Sutra 楞嚴經; the monk Yuanhui 元惠, who resided at Waterfall Rock 瀑布岩 and traveled between Mount Luofu and Mount Tiantai 天台山. In 738, Emperor Xuanzong 宣宗 built the Huashou Temple 華首寺 on the southwest foothills of Mount Luofu, where 500 monks congregated at its peaks. In the Song Dynasty, notable monks of Buddhism on Mount Luofu included Yunda 雲達, Qide 齊德, Shending 神定, and Zuyan 祖演. During the Ming Dynasty, numerous eminent monks emerged on Mount Luofu as well, including Zhikong 直空, Huiguo 晦果, Ruzheng 如正, and Shixu 十虛. Entering the Qing Dynasty, the monk Kongyin 空隱 and his disciples Hanshi 函是 and Hanke 函可 established the “Boshan Dharma Gate（博山法門)”. These esteemed Buddhist figures expounded Buddhist teachings on Mount Luofu, playing a significant role in spreading Buddhist culture in South China.
In addition to the developments of local history and Daoist and Buddhist teachings, Mount Luofu is also one of the birthplaces of private education. Since the Jin Dynasty, many literati and scholars have established academies and study lounges on Mount Luofu, making it a popular place for study, gathering, and teaching, thus becoming an important local educational center. For example, during the Song and Yuan Dynasties, there were official institutions like the Yuzhang Academy 豫章書院, the Jingguan Academy 靜觀書院 in Huanglong Cave 黃龍洞, and privately established academies like the Zhangliu Academy 張留書院. In the Ming Dynasty, Mount Luofu witnessed the emergence of many private study halls and libraries, such as the Bitang Study Hall 弼唐精舍 and the Xianzi Reading Platform 冼子讀書台, along with the Four Sages Shrine 四賢祠 dedicated to venerable Confucian masters. Among the numerous eminent scholars who taught and received disciples on Mount Luofu, the most renowned was Zhan Ruoshui 湛若水, who held various high-ranking positions in the Ming government. Su Dongpo 蘇東坡 also resided on Mount Luofu for an extended period, during which he penned famous works like “Miscellaneous Notes on Mount Luofu (Zashu Luofushi 雜書羅浮事)” and “Inscription at the Zuoquan Pavilion (Shu Zhuoxiquan 書卓錫泉).” Additionally, notable literary figures such as Li Bai 李白, Du Fu 杜甫, Han Yu 韓愈, Yang Wanli 楊萬里, Liu Yuxi 劉禹錫, Zhu Xi 朱熹, Qu Dajun 屈大均, and Tang Xianzu 湯顯祖 have all composed poems and writings praising and memorizing Mount Luofu. 
Across its storied history, both locally and statewide, Mount Luofu has served as a hallowed ground of spiritual and intellectual practice, weaving together the tapestry of religious devotion and scholarly pursuit, creating a rich mosaic of cultural and intellectual expression and leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape of China.",-200,2024,2358,1086,Yu Wang,2024-03-25 09:47:51.311 +0100,2024-03-30 19:33:28.198 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2277,Western Zhou Bronze Inscriptions (Xi Zhou jinwen 西周金文),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The name Western Zhou 西周 bronze inscriptions (jinwen 金文) refers to a variety of texts inscribed on bronze vessels and bells, primarily for ritual purposes, during the Western Zhou dynasty, over a time span of less than 300 years, ranging from 1046 to 771 BCE.
Most of the ritual bronzes that came down to us, both inscribed and uninscribed, were found inside burials or, alternatively, in underground hoards, where families who possessed such goods (exclusively noble families) hid them to prevent them from being stolen by their enemies.
The bronze inscriptions themselves represent the main source for their study, given the absence of other contemporary textual sources, along with the characteristics of the bronzes themselves on which they are inscribed and the burials and hoards in which they are found. 
The very metal from which the inscribed vessels are cast, a bronze made from an alloy of copper, tin, and lead, was considered a means of communication with the deity Shangdi 上帝, as well as a symbol of both political and religious power: for this reason, the privilege of casting bronze was reserved for the Zhou king, who shared it with his allies through ritual ceremonies, enabling them to initiate rites for their ancestral spirits. Inscribed vessels were mostly employed in rituals for offering drinking and food sacrifices to the spirits and, in the case of bronze bells, for the music performance during rituals. The ritual employment of inscribed bronzes might signify that the writings, which often included military and political achievements of the owner, were inscribed both for the ceremony participants, the descendants, and the ancestral spirits to be informed. In return for these sacrifices and prayers, blessings from the ancestral spirits were expected, in the form of wealth, longevity, and fertility.  
While, at first, these inscriptions were short phrases that might even only include the name of a clan, gradually they began to display texts about ancestors’ worship, treaties, war reports, awards, etc. As highlighted in Schwermann 2014, event notations and dedications of bronze
inscriptions often also contain references to authors’ names, even though more than one individual was involved in the production of an inscribed bronze: the donor and commissioner, a composer who wrote or reworked a pre-existing text, a calligrapher who produced a master copy for the casting, and a caster. 
According to Cook and Goldin 2000, circumstantial evidence seems to prove that, at least as it regards later inscriptions, texts inscribed on bronze possibly derived from longer brush-written records on perishable materials kept by the royal court or aristocratic lineages.
The tradition of casting bronze and inscribing characters on it was inherited from the earlier Shang dynasty 商 (c. 1600 BCE-c. 1045 BCE), along with other features of the ritual system, such as the veneration of certain deities, including Shangdi, and the great majority of sacrifices to ancestors. The Zhou, however, introduced the concept of heavenly mandate (Tianming 天命) through which the ruler received his right to rule directly from heaven in the form of ""virtue"" or ""power"" (de 德).
We distinguish three main phases within the three centuries circa of Western Zhou rule, corresponding to variations in the type and number of bronzes, decorations, and the quantity and length of inscriptions, which implied a gradual differentiation from Shang bronzes: the earliest phase of the Western Zhou Dynasty, the middle period, and the latest phase.
During the earliest period of the Western Zhou Dynasty, most of the bronzes were not inscribed or were inscribed with short texts of up to ten characters, reflecting the Shang tradition. At this time, drinking vessels (such as the jue 爵) were the most commonly cast. The system of bronze casting and inscribing underwent gradual changes starting from the middle Western Zhou period. Firstly, the production of alcoholic beverage drinking and storing vessels gradually diminished, replaced by the increased production of vessels for storing grain and cooked meat (such as the gui 簋 tureen and the ding 鼎 cauldron), implying a switch in the ceremonial focus from beverages to food and agriculture. Decorative motives evolved from naturalistic and animal-like shapes to abstract and geometric décors, including wave- and scale-like motives, implying a gradual decline of Shang taotie 饕餮masks, dragons, and tigers (replaced by bird decorations).
Starting from the IX century BCE, a process of standardization of the shape and number of vessels began because of which, by the end of the Western Zhou period, the typologies of vessels were significantly reduced: only two standard types of gui tureen and ding cauldron embellished with abstract patterns were still produced. Around the same period, also large musical bells (yongzhong 甬鐘) were commonly cast, reflecting the growing importance of musical performance in rituals. These artifacts were now produced in sets, of huge dimensions, decorated with bold abstract patterns, and inscribed with identical texts. The texts, that originally were short and hidden inside the vessels, became significantly longer and were typically inscribed on the outer surface of vessels and bells, visible even at some distance. The texts began to gradually include lineage histories (up to the first ancestor to work for the Zhou), commemorations for ceremonies of various kinds, feasts, military campaigns, awards, treaties, etc. While the texts gradually became longer and more complex, they also became more and more standardized and repetitive. During the last phase of the Western Zhou, the reiterative style of the inscriptions, together with the decorative patterns of the vessels, tended to be evocative of the past, through references to the dynastic founders, indirectly serving also as historical memory keepers, besides being ritual items. Archaeological evidence seems to prove that, during the latest period of the Western Zhou dynasty, inherited vessels were kept together with the newly earned ones.",-1046,-771,82,1195,Francesca Puglia,2024-03-25 13:23:15.388 +0100,2024-03-30 21:58:47.744 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH)

2280,Enki and Ninmaḫ,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"“Enki and Ninmaḫ” is a short Sumerian literary composition, of circa 140 lines, that addresses the creation of humans and the decree of their destinies. At some point, during the celebration for the anthropogenic act, Enki and Ninmaḫ seem to compete to find out who can better define the appropriate destinies for some newly created disabled humans. Enki manages to decree a good fate to every single case/creature created by Ninmaḫ, but on the contrary, the goddess is unable to do so for Enki’s creature, Umul. As such, the composition ends with Enki being praised.
Several translations for this composition were proposed over the years, beginning with a partial one by Kramer (1944), and a first complete one by Benito (1969), to which more were followed. More recently, Lambert (2013) and Ceccarelli (2016) offered new proposals, working with several manuscripts and copies, mostly dated from the Old Babylonian period, though they also used some bilingual versions exhumed in Nineveh, dated to Ashurbanipal’s reign (668-627).
The narrative can be divided into two main parts, with different sections each. The first part starts with a description of the cosmic status quo in a distant time, where a group of “minor” gods worked for the group of the “senior” ones at great expenses (lines. 1-11). Upon hearing their complaints, Namma, the primeval goddess, felt compelled to act, thus exhorting her son, Enki, to create a “substitute” for the divine workers (lines 12-23). After pondering on the matter, Enki agrees to act, summoning several goddesses related to creative powers, and together the first humans are molded from clay (lines 24- 37, followed by some fragmentary lines). 
When the narrative resumes, which can be identified as the beginning of the second part, the deities are feasting together, celebrating the anthropogenic act (lines 44-71). The abundant consumption of beer, particularly by Ninmaḫ and Enki, provoked some enthusiasm, leading the goddess to brag on her capacities to decree destinies to every single human (ls. 52-55). Enki’s reaction is immediate, defying the goddess to a contest: he claims he will define a good fate to every single human with disabilities she fashions, and defies her to do the same to a creature of his own making (lines 56-61). For seven times, Ninmaḫ creates these humans with disabilities or illnesses (the first on the hands, the second on the eyes, the third on the feet, the fourth with some kind of a mental problem, the fifth with a genital condition, the sixth with infertility and the last one as a human with no sexual organs) , and for seven times, Enki decrees a good fate for them (respectively: unspecified service for the ruler, musician for the ruler, silverwork, unspecified service for the ruler, healing of the genital disease, service to the queen as weaver, and, lastly service for the ruler) (lines 63-82).  
Then, Enki fashions Umul, who some scholars (Kilmer 1976: 267; Rodin: 2014:293; Kağnici 2018: 442) understood as a premature child or even (an aborted?) not fully developed baby, that displays several disabilities, to whom Ninmaḫ is unable to decree a good fate (lines 83-101). In the last section, both deities exchange words, with the goddess seemingly accepting the winning and thus the superiority of Enki, who is praised by the narrator (lines 102-141).
As such, one can say there are two intertwined topoi in this composition: the anthropogonic account, which according to Frymer-Kensky (1977: 155) and more recently Pinto (2014: 17-18) was deeply influenced by the famous epic composition Atraḫasīs; and the explanation for the divine-origin of disabilities and illnesses, with accordingly solutions for their societal integration (either by decreeing them functions or by providing the means to cure/relieve the ailment). Both topoi are entangled in the theocentric mentality that these literary compositions display, diachronically.",-1900,-1600,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,2024-03-27 19:16:52.984 +0100,2024-04-04 22:53:33.900 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2281,Suleymaniye Mosque in Rhodes,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Suleymaniye Mosque in Rhodes was built shortly after the Ottoman conquest of Rhodes in 1522. The mosque is located in a central location in the walled Old Town of Rhodes, at the top of Sokratous Street, one of the main streets of the city. The mosque features a central dome over a square base, flanked by two smaller domes over square bases. It is named in honor of the Sultan Suleyman, who ruled the Ottoman Empire at the time of the conquest of Rhodes.

Visiting ca. 1671, Evliya Celebi, an Ottoman traveller, described the mosque in detail. He noted that the domes were leaded, ""in the style of Istanbul,"" as were several other mosques in the Old Town of Rhodes. The windows were decorated with ""several types of glass""; the main dome was supported by marble and poryphyry columns. (Evliya, 272-273.) Notably, Evliya Celebi also writes that the entryway was decorated with ""pictures of flowers and fruits""; this suggests that the current marble entryway, which matches this description, dates from before 1671. Evliya Celebi also writes that this carved door was formerly a church door.

The mosque was damaged in 1856 as a result of an ammunition explosion (caused by lightning) in the nearby church of the Knights of Saint John. This led to the collapse of the minaret, which was later rebuilt. The minaret began to lean in the 1980s and was archaeologically documented before being demolished. Further restoration work on the mosque was undertaken by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture between 1998 and 2006.",1522,2005,2361,1520,Sofia Kane,2024-03-27 19:49:16.355 +0100,2024-04-01 15:32:59.409 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2282,Heart Sutra 波若波羅蜜多心經,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Heart Sutra represents one of the most prominent texts in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, being one of the dominant ways in which many people today understand and engage with Buddhism across East Asia. Despite its widespread use across the centuries, the text’s origins and provenance are somewhat ambiguous and remain the subject of intense academic debate. Although identified as one of ‘Perfection of Wisdom’ Prajñāpāramitā प्रज्ञापारमिता sutras, and certainly concerned with the nature of reality as many of these sutra are, marked differences from other sutras, lack of evidence for it prior to the 7th C CE and linguistic factors have raised the prospect that rather than being a product of the early South Asian Sanskrit tradition, something its traditional narrative purports, the text may have originated in China in the medieval period and was subsequently translated into Sanskrit and other languages.
Regardless of its origin, there are two related versions of the text in use today, a short, ‘canonical’ version familiar to most people in East Asia purported to have been translated by the monk Xuanzang 玄奘 (602-664) in 649 and a ‘long’ version which contains the content of the short version alongside introductory and concluding sections, something commonly seen in other Buddhist sutras. The longer version is often encountered in tantric practices in some Vajrayana communities in Tibet and Mongolia.
The shared material of both versions depict the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara अवलोकितस्वर, identified in East Asia as Guanyin 觀音, gaining clarity upon meditation that all things are ‘empty’ and that this fundamental reality is universal to all aspects of human experience, the skandhas स्कन्ध. Avalokiteśvara’s awakening to this truth sees him address the Buddhist disciple Śāriputra शारिपुत्र to explain that since everything is empty concepts such as the ‘Four Noble Truths’ are in themselves empty as well, and it is this understanding, the Perfection of Wisdom, the enlightened beings have realised. The passage ends with a mantra, common in Buddhist sutras, reinforcing the lessons of the text.
The text’s brevity, simple language and repetitive rhetoric not only allow for ease of memorisation, but also strongly suggest the text is meant for a lay audience. That it encapsulates many of the basic principles of Mahayana Buddhism – the Perfection of Wisdom, value of bodhisattvas, basic Buddhist concepts, etc. – only serves to reinforce its value as a lay teaching tool to familiarise people with Mahayana Buddhism.",649,2024,497,1555,Justin Winslett,2024-03-27 23:59:30.022 +0100,2024-04-03 05:11:34.206 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2285,Enki and Ninḫursaĝa,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"“Enki and Ninḫursaĝa” is a Sumerian literary composition of circa 280 lines that addresses the divine creative processes, at several levels, while exploring the tension between the protagonist deities. Because it is set on a land idyllically described, Dilmun, it was initially compared with the biblical paradise, a notion now long abandoned. 
Kramer was the first to attempt a full philological publication (1945) whose translation he revised some years later (1955). Attinger presented his own proposal several decades later (1984), followed by other authors in the years to come (Jacobsen 1987; Bottéro and Kramer 1989, Römer 1993, for instance). Though its origins are older (at least from the Ur III period) the main known copies of this composition are dated to the Old Babylonian period and seem linked with school contexts (Rodin 2014:116). Several references point out to a strong influence of its content in the elaboration of the Sumerian compositions known as “Enlil and Ninlil” and “Enlil and Sud” (Cooper 1989, Vantisphout 1987). 
The narrative begins with an idyllic description of the land of Dilmum (modern day Bahrein), where Enki and his divine consort, Ninsikila rest (lines 1-28), in what can be seen as a state before the divine creative process begun (Lambert and Tournay 1949:122; Alster 1978:16) Yet, as water is lacking, the goddess asks Enki to make the land fertile, to which he complies, further stressing that Dilmun will be so rich that it will become an emporium (lines 29-49). Next, according with the version of the manuscript from Ur, there is an interpolation (Komoróczy 1977) focused on the richness of the trade carried out in this maritime trading port. Numerous products (mainly precious metals, stones, and woods) and several regions, which were commercial partners of the cities of Sumer, are thus alluded (ls. 49A– 49V). Afterwards, the main narrative resumes, with the description of the creation of the abundant waters, as the sun-god Utu rises, thus turning Dilmun into an emporium, as Enki had previously stated (lines 50-62.). 
This deity is thus described as being within the marshes, where he ejaculated into Nintur/Ninḫursaĝa, who got pregnant and gave birth to Ninnisig (lines 63-87). Three similar sections are then described: from the marshes, Enki sees a goddess (Ninnisig, Ninkura, Ninimma, respectively) who catches his attention, and, after talking with his divine assistant, Isimud, they sail ashore. A sexual act is performed, the goddess gets pregnant, and gives birth to another goddess, who in turn gets the attention of Enki, who is on the marshes, repeating the events (ls. 88-107; 108-126; 126A-126CC, respectively).
Uttu seems to break the cycle. In a rather fragmentary passage, she receives instructions from Nintur/Ninḫursaĝa (lines 127-146) and when the narrative resumes, the meeting with Enki is described in different terms: Uttu asks for gifts, to which Enki’s complies (lines 147-165). With the gifts, he presents himself at Uttu’s door, being welcomed inside her house. It is only then that the sexual act is performed (l. 168-189). Impregnated, Uttu gives birth to 8 plants to which Enki, after tasting them, decrees its fates (lines 190-219). This act seems to infuriate Ninḫursaĝa, who curses him, making him ill, a situation which impels a fox to try to mend things (lines 220-246). After some missing lines, Ninḫursaĝa is described as seating Enki on her vagina, healing 8 of his body parts, by creating a deity from each one: Ab-u from the top of the head; Ninsikila from the hair; Ningiriutud from the nose; Ninkasi  from the mouth Nazi for the throat; Azimua, from the arm; Ninti from the ribs, and Ensag from the sides (lines 247-271). The narrative comes to an end with new fates being decreed by Ninḫursaĝa to these deities, and with a praise to Enki (lines 272-281)  
The multi-nuanced fertile actions of Enki can be read as a way to legitimate his power over Ninḫursaĝa within the pantheon. Yet, as Rodin (2014: 218-220) postulated there was still a need to maintain the imperative presence of both female and male deities in the creative processes, which can explain the active role of Ninḫursaĝa throughout the narrative. 
This interpretation runs parallel to a political-religious discourse of dominance over Dilmun, probably during the Ur III period (Alster 1983:59), which can lead to other fruitful analyses on the dynamics of ancient southern Mesopotamian context, independent from the (initial) biblical lens.",-1900,-1600,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,2024-03-28 19:25:12.072 +0100,2024-04-04 22:52:20.546 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2289,Glastonbury Goddess Temple,50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Glastonbury Goddess Temple is located in the heart of Glastonbury, Somerset, UK, and is dedicated to the veneration of the Divine Feminine and goddesses. It is considered the religious centre of the Glastonbury Avalon Tradition, though pilgrims of various faiths and spiritual paths visit the Temple daily.

The Glastonbury Goddess Temple was founded in 2000, starting as a temporary 'pop-up' Temple, hosted in different locations within the town of Glastonbury. The first Temple ceremony was held in the Miracles Room in the Courtyard of the 'Glastonbury Experience' (just off from High Street) on 29th May 2000. 

In 2001 the Temple moved to a room previously known as the Ark (above the Library of Avalon in the Courtyard) and in February 2002, the Temple officially opened as a permanent space (though initially only open for 2 days a week). 

On 18th June 2003, the Registry of Places of Worship formally recognised the Glastonbury Goddess Temple as a Place of Worship. The Temple is now open 365 days a year and as of 2014 is one of the first places in the UK to offer legally registered Pagan marriages.",2000,2024,2396,1610,Olivia Ciaccia,2024-03-31 12:42:55.533 +0200,2024-04-07 22:43:40.067 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

•	 القادرية الفارضية: وهى الأقدم عهداً بمصر، ترجع جذورها التاريخية إلى القرن السابع الهجرى، ومقرها بجامع السادة القادرية بالقرافة الصغرى بالقاهرة، وهو مسجدٌ عتيق تفوح منه رائحة القرون، وكان المسجد قد بُنى فى القرن السابع ليكون زاويةً للشيخ «عدىّ بن مسافر» أحد تلاميذ الإمام الجيلانى، وبمجىء حفيد الإمام الجيلانى (علاء الدين علىّ القادرى) الذى استوطن مصر مع أسرته، منذ القرن الثامن الهجرىأصبحت مدينة القرافة مركزا للقادرية أما لقب «الفارضية» فهو مستمدٌّ من أحد مشايخ الطريقة المتأخرين، هو حفيد الإمام الجيلانى: محمد بن سليمان، الملقَّب بالفارضى، لأنه كان يتولَّى إثبات فروض النساء على الرجال، وهى وظيفة شرعية قديمة، منها اشتُق أيضاً لقب شاعر الصوفية الأشهر: ابن الفارض
•	 القادرية القاسمية: وهى ثانية الطرق القادرية المسجَّلة اليوم بالمجلس الأعلى للطرق الصوفية. وهى فرع عتيق من القادرية بمصر، ذكر المستشرق الفرنسى المرموق «لوى ماسينيون» أنها وفدت إلى مصر فى القرن التاسع عشر، لكن هناك عديداً من الشواهد، تدل على أنها أقدم من ذلك عهداً بالبلاد.. وقد ذكر  شيخ القادرية القاسمية (نسبة إلى قاسم الكبير) قصة غريبة تؤرخ لبداية هذه الطريقة بمصر، هى حسبما يحكى الشيخ: دخلت امرأةٌ على الإمام الجيلانى فى مدرسته ببغداد، تشكو إليه مرضاً عضالاً كان الأطباء قد وصفوا لعلاجه الرُّمان، ولم يكن الوقت أوان رُمَّان، فأسرع «عيسى» ابن الإمام الجيلانى، ومَدَّ يده فى الهواء وأحضر لها رُمَّانة! فقال له الإمام الجيلانى إن بغداد لن تسعهما معاً، وأمرَه بنـزول مصر، فبدأت الطريقة القادرية القاسمية فى مصر على يديه! وقد تولى  فرع القادرية القاسمية بالفيوم،في الفترة الحديثة  شيخٌ على درجة عالية من العلم والمعرفة، هو الشيخ «محمود عبدالتواب الفَزَارى» الذى كان قد تلقى معالم الطريق الصوفى من والده، ودرس فى الأزهر، ثم درس الجيولوجيا فى جامعة الإسكندرية وحصل على الماجستير فى الجيولوجيا التطبيقية من جامعة يزيربورج الألمانية.. وعاد إلى الفيوم فاستصلح أرضاً كثيرة للزراعة، وأقام رباطات صوفية عديدة فى صحراء الفيوم.
•	 القادرية الشرعية: فى أعماق مسجد الإمام الشعرانى بالقاهرة، ينتصب فرعٌ من فروع القادرية بمصر، كان قد وفد من بلاد المغرب مع الشيخ «عبد المنعم القادرى» الذى تلقى الطريق عن شيخه محمد حبيب الله الشنقيطى، الذى تلقاه بدوره عن شيخه المجاهد العظيم: ماء العينين القادرى، وإذ يستوقفنا هنا سبب تسمية هذه الطريقة، بالقادرية (الشرعية) فإن شيخ الطريقة المشار إليه قبل قليل، يقول فى كتابه «الركائز الإيمانية» إن تسمية طريقته مستمد من الأوراد الشرعية التى أُلهم بجمعها، ولا تخرج فى جملتها عن الكتاب والسنة.
•	القادرية النيازية:  وهذا الفرع القادرى متصل النسب بالإمام الجيلانى عن طريق ولده الشيخ عبدالرزاق. والقادرية النيازية وفدت إلى مصر من تركيا، منذ قرابة خمسة قرون، فقد نزل بعض شيوخها الأوائل فى النصف الثانى من القرن العاشر الهجرى، واستوطنوا الإسكندرية منذ ذلك التاريخ. ومن أبرز شيوخ هذا الفرع القادري في الفترة الحديثة الشيخ إبراهيم حلمى القادرى.. وهو سكندرى المولد والمنشأ والإقامة والوفاة! فقد ولد بالإسكندرية فى 16 محرم سنة 1322 هجرية، وتلقى الرعاية من أفراد البيت القادرى الذى نشأ فيه، وظل متولِّياً مشيخة الطريقة من وفاة والده سنة 1355، وحتى انتقاله إلى جوار رَبِّه وهو ساجدٌ يصلى بمريديه تراويح ليلة القدر سنة 1390 هجرية.وكان الشيخ مدرسةً صوفيةً جمعت أشتات المعارف الدينية، وفى هذه المدرسة تخرج رجال.. كما ترك الشيخ العديد من المؤلفات، منها ما هو مطبوع ومتداول، ومنها  ما يزال مخطوطا  وقد نصَّ الشيخ إبراهيم حلمى القادرى على تولية ولده (محمد) قبل انتقاله إلى جوار ربه.",1200,2024,2372,1550,ltaief zorgui,2024-04-01 00:56:37.506 +0200,2024-04-01 00:56:37.506 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2294,Baopuzi neipian 抱朴子內篇,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Baopuzi neipian 抱朴子內篇 (Master Who Embraces Simplicity Inner Chapters) is written by Ge Hong 葛洪 (283-343), a prominent literatus and religious thinker who lived during the Western and Eastern Jin, a period marked by social and political turmoil. Baopuzi is also a sobriquet name of Ge Hong and it comes from the Laozi 老子 chapter 19 “exhibit the unadorned and embrace the uncarved block 見素抱樸”. The character pu 樸[朴] literally means uncarved block but is also translated as simplicity. Ge Hong’s life is mostly known from two sources: 1) his autobiographical postface 自敍 which is found at the end of the Baopuzi waipian 抱朴子外篇 (Master Who Embraces Simplicity Outer Chapters); 2) the biography in the Jinshu 晉書 (History of the Jin). He was from an aristocratic family in Jurong 句容 (in modern day Jiangsu 江蘇) and grew up in a literati milieu, thus he was well versed in the Confucian (ru 儒) classics. He also studied esoteric Daoist texts through his teacher Zheng Yin 鄭隱 from the age of fourteen. For a long period, he led a secular life, serving the government in different roles, and was also a prolific writer. Besides the Baopuzi, the Shenxian zhuan 神仙傳 (Biographies of Divine Immortals) is also written by him. But there are many more texts which have traditionally been attributed to his name. In the year around 331, he finally retired to the Luofu 羅浮 mountains, allegedly for more serious engagement with self-cultivation and alchemy. Ge Hong is said to have died through “release by means of a corpse” (shijie 尸解), which, according to Ge Hong’s own account in the Baopuzi neipian, is the lowest level of transcendence (xian 仙).
The Baopuzi consists of two separate texts, waipian and neipian. The waipian broadly deals with social, ethical and political issues from the perspective of a Confucian literatus, whereas the neipian treats the topic of immortality from the perspective of an “adept who knows the Way 知道之士”. The neipian contains twenty chapters and each chapter stands as a separate essay. It dates to 318, although it may have gone through a revision around 330. This means the text was completed prior to his retirement to the Luofu mountains where Ge Hong pursued his personal immortality. The neipian first of all reads as an apologetics, fervently defending the idea that perpetuity of life (changsheng 長生) is attainable through study. He repeatedly argues that no one is born as an immortal and any person who has trust in the Way can become an immortal if they can obtain the right formula and methods from an enlightened teacher. However, Ge Hong also, somewhat paradoxically, says that these persons are born under the right constellations, thus fated (ming 命) to be immortals. 
Along with the main argument that immortality is possible, the text discusses an extensive range of methods through which immortality can be attained. For these accounts, Ge Hong heavily relies on the numerous Daoist texts transmitted to him, many of these texts are lost today. Among the techniques and formulas discussed in the neipian, the most crucial are the procurement and ingestion of the great medicines or elixirs (jindan dayao 金丹大藥) and the meditative practices of guarding the One (shouyi 守一) and embryonic breathing (taixi 胎息). Less important methods comprise various techniques of yangsheng 養生 which include circulating qi (xingqi 行氣), abstaining from grains (bigu 辟穀), practicing daoyin 導引, and also sexual practices (fangzhong zi shu 房中之術) such as huanjing bunao 還精補腦 (returning the essence to replenish the brain). The text also talks in detail about other minor techniques such as becoming invisible (dunjia 遁甲) or using talismans (fu 符) and spells (zhu 祝). These can be helpful in certain situations, such as entering dangerous mountains, but Ge Hong is clear that they do not lead to immortality.   
With regards to his intended audience, Ge Hong several times expresses a desire that his book might attract a few future enthusiasts who have sincere trust in immortality. However, the text is primarily addressed to his contemporary literati. Ge Hong spends much of his literary energy criticizing literati who scoff at the idea of immortality. If they do not believe that the Way of undying (busi zhi dao 不死之道) exists, this is because of their incomplete understanding of the world. For this argument, the text is extremely dense with allusions to and quotations from pre-Qin and Han classics. But Ge Hong also emphasizes that, even if one has trust in immortality, one can only attain it by obtaining the right methods transmitted by a trustworthy teacher. Thus, Ge Hong’s main motivation for writing the neipian seems to be the creation and assertion of his lineage which has passed on from Zuo Ci 左慈 to Ge Xuan 葛玄 (164-244, Ge Hong’s paternal great-uncle), then to Zheng Yin and finally to Ge Hong himself. Ge Hong gives detailed accounts of his relationship to Zheng Yin, also a long bibliography of Daoist texts (chapter 19) which were in his teacher’s possession. While claiming that his lineage has the most authentic Daoist teachings, Ge Hong often warns his readers that the world is full of fraudulent teachers.   
As the author of the Baopuzi neipian, Ge Hong unarguably becomes a crucial figure in the religious and intellectual history of early medieval China. The text is an invaluable repository and testimony of diverse religious practices and beliefs in the Jiangnan 江南 area from the late Han to the fourth centuries. With regards to the early history of Daoism, there has been scholarly debate whether Ge Hong should be understood as a Daoist, and where to situate his claimed lineage. Ge Hong lived before the Tianshi dao 天使道 (Way of the Celestial Masters) became prominent in the South, also before the establishment of the two other main Daoist traditions, the Shangqing 上淸 (Highest Clarity) and Lingbao 靈寶 (Numinous Treasure). The quasi-fictive narration of Lingbao tradition given by Ge Chaofu 葛巢甫 (Ge Hong’s grandnephew) also complicates the situation. Some scholars understand that Ge Hong’s lineage was a part of another early Daoist tradition, Taiqing 太淸 (Great Clarity) which was heavily involved in external alchemy (waidan 外丹). This is supported by the fact that not only does the Baopuzi neipian repeatedly argue that ingesting great medicines is essential for achieving immortality, the text also mentions the three main Taiqing scriptures—the Taiqing jing 太淸經 (Scriptures of Great Clarity), the Jiudan jing 九丹經 (Scripture of the Nine Elixirs) and the Jinye jing 金液經 (Scripture of the Golden Liquor).",220,330,138,761,Lana Ko,2024-04-03 13:59:50.399 +0200,2024-04-04 17:33:02.374 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2295,Nergal and Ereškigal,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"“Nergal and Ereškigal” is an Akadian literary composition focused on describing how Nergal became ruler of the Netherworld, the Mesopotamian cosmic domain of the dead, traditionally ruled by the goddess Ereškigal. Two main versions of this narrative are presently known: the earlier one was found in Amarna (Egypt), and though it was probably written down during the mid-15th century BCE, the copy exhumated is dated to the 14th century BCE (Pettinato 2000: 5, 47). As for the later version, which is considered the standard one, it is known through two copies, one from Sultantepe (Turkey) dated to the 8th-7th centuries BCE, and another from Uruk (Iraq), dated to circa 500 BCE. Throughout time, several specialists proposed the translation of these versions, such as Gurney (1960), Dalley (1989, revised 2000), Izre’el (1997), Pettinato (2000) or Ponchia and Luukko (2013).
Though they differ in length, both versions describe how there was a divine banquet in heavens to which Ereškigal could not attend, as she could not leave her domain. She therefore sent her divine assistant, Namtar, who is received by all deities with the necessary protocolar respect. Yet, one god, Nergal, did not paid his respects, which was considered a great offense to Ereškigal. In the shorter Amarna version (circa 90 lines), the queen of the dead swears to kill him, to which Nergal, with the help of his father, the god of wisdom, Ea, responds by attacking that realm assisted by several daimōnes. He succeeds in taking Ereškigal from her throne, and as he was ready to kill her, she persuaded him to become her spouse and therefore to become lord of the Netherworld.
The longest standard version (circa 350 lines) tells a different story, though the outcome is similar: sent by Anu to the Netherworld to apologize for his protocolar faux pas, Nergal is instructed by Ea to not engage in some acts while there, which included not having sex with Ereškigal. Yet, after resisting a first time when faced with her seductive naked figure, while she is getting ready to bathe, during a second sight, Nergal cannot control his desire, and the two passionately embrace. The couple shares the bed for 6 days and 6 nights, but when the seventh day arrives, Nergal leaves her, and returns to the heavenly domain. Angry, as she does not want to be separated from him, Ereškigal sends Namtar to get him back. After some trouble in identifying Nergal (as he was protected by Ea’s action), Namtar finally finds him, bringing him back to the Netherworld. This time, Nergal violently bursts through the 7 gates of that domain, quickly arriving at Ereškigal’s presence. He then grabs her by her hair and takes her to bed. Again, they spend 6 days and 6 nights together, and at the arrival of the seventh day, in a rather fragmentary passage, Anu seems to blesse their union/marriage, and as such, Nergal becomes ruler of the Netherworld.
This narrative displays parallelisms with other Sumero-Akkadian compositions, such as “Ištar's Descent to the Netherworld”, as some of the formulae used are practically the same, especially in what concerns the way the Netherworld is first described (“as a place of no return”) as well as in the threat Ereškigal makes if Nergal does not return to her company (of “raising the dead”). Also, the instructions Ea gives Nergal, before he goes to the Netherworld, are quite similar to the ones this deity gives to the creatures he moulded to save Inanna’s from the imprisonment (death!) on that cosmic domain, in “Inanna’s Descent to the netherworld”, as well as the instructions the famous Urukian hero gives Enkidu in Tablet XII of the “Gilgameš Epic” (Almeida 2023: 302-303). Also, as Abusch (1986:186) first noted, there are some parallels between the Amarna’s version passage where Ereškigal persuades Nergal to become her husband, and the episode narrated in Tablet VI of the “Gilgames Epic”, where Ištar proposes to the eponymous hero.
Nevertheless, though evoking and using several (older) traditions, this composition seems to have been created circa mid-second millennium BCE to accommodate the change in the Netherworld throne, which until the Old Babylonian period seemed to belong solely to Ereškigal (Bottéro and Kramer 1989: 454; Katz 2003: 404-420; 2005:82-83).",-1600,-500,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,2024-04-03 15:19:28.898 +0200,2024-04-04 22:54:10.609 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)

The church is a single chapel with a pointed barrel vault, divided into two bays by an arch. The paintings are only partially preserved and (as of 2022) they were further obscured by scaffolding along the interior which helps support the building. 
Among the remaining paintings, the image of the Virgin Platytera is located in the sanctuary apse with the Mandylion and Annunciation along the triumphal arch. Also visible, along the arch dividing the two bays are the images of the Ten Martyrs of Crete (only around 5 can still be seen).

Similar to other churches of the region, it is a single nave chapel with a pointed barrel vault which is divided into two bays by a transverse arch. 
	The paintings inside the church are generally well preserved and legible. The paintings in the sanctuary, albeit not well preserved, show, in the apse, the image of the Deesis above the Communion of the Apostles (second register) and finally, surrounding the stone altar, what was once, four co-officiating bishops (only two are today preserved). The triumphal arch holds the Mandylion and the Annunciation above the images of the deacon saints St. Stephen (left) and St. Romanus (right). Images of St. Titus of Crete, St. Polycarpus, and the Virgin Hodegetria can be seen on the southern wall of the sanctuary divided today by a modern wooden iconostasis. Similarly, St. Eleutherius, St. Cyril and St. Anthony are located on the northern wall of the sanctuary. The vault holds the image of the Ascension above smaller scenes from the life of St. George. Three, possibly once possibly four, images of standing prophets decorate the area just east of the transverse arch which holds three remaining busts of the Ten Martyrs of Crete.
	The nave vault holds images from the Christological cycle (above) along with scenes from the life of St. George (below). This includes, on the southern half, the Nativity of Christ, the Transfiguration and, from the life of St. George, the Martyrdom on the Wheel and the saint distributing his wealth to the poor. The northern half continues these cycles with the Baptism of Christ, the Entry into Jerusalem and the Anastasis (above) and St. George in the Cauldron, St. George in the Lime Pit and the Destruction of Idols (below).

2305,"The Church of Christ, Agia Irini (Selino), Crete",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The Church of Christ, located just outside the village of Agia Irini near a stream, is a single nave church dated by inscription to 1357-58. A later narthex was added onto the west end of the church, and one enters the church through the southern wall of the narthex. Both the nave and the narthex have a pointed barrel vault interior and a saddle roof exterior. The church paintings are heavily damaged but mostly legible. 
Within the church sanctuary the apse is painted with the image of Christ Pantocrator above the images of two co-officiating bishops, St. John Chrysostom and St. Basil. The triumphal arch has an image of the Transfiguration above the apse and the scene of the Annunciation flanking the apse. The vault above the sanctuary shows the Ascension of Christ. The gallery of saints along the northern wall has the images of St. Stephen, St. Nicholas, and St. Polycarpus followed, past the paintings imitating a transverse arch, by three unidentified military saints on horseback. The southern wall gallery of saints has the images of an unidentified bishop, St. Eleutherius, the Archangel Michael, St. Marina (damaged by the placement of a later window), St. Paraskevi and St. Kyriaki.
The barrel vault of the northern wall shows the Hypapante and the Baptism of Christ above and the Virgin blessed by the Priests and the Empty Sepulcher below. Similarly, the barrel vault of the southern side shows the Nativity above with Christ Anapeson and Christ appearing to the two Marys below. The western wall has a large image of the Crucifixion above some remaining scenes from the last judgment, particularly images of the damned and the Psychostasia on the southern side of the western door. To the northern side of the door are an unidentified military saint standing next to St. Mamas.
	The narthex possibly dates to the fifteenth century though the paintings are heavily damaged and the date cannot be determined with any accuracy. The eastern wall of the narthex includes an image of the Last Supper in the uppermost register above a small niche and doorway which once marked the entrance to the church. Four busts of female saints flank the niche in the second register. The doorway was once flanked by two saints, possibly military saints, but this cannot be determined with any certainty. 
	Additional scenes from the life of Christ are located in the barrel vault without repeating any of the scenes located inside the nave. Two unidentified female saints can still be seen on the southern wall, west of the doorway but the remaining figures from the gallery of the saints have been lost. The western wall, also in a bad state of preservation with a later window opened onto this wall, has an image of the Koimesis (the Dormition of the Virgin) and the Archangel Michael.
	The church’s dedicatory inscription (from the fourteenth-century paintings) mentions that the church was built and painted by the Orthodox Christians Ioannis Pattaktenis, his wife and children, Leon Pattaktenis, his wife, the monk Kostattios, Georgios Pattaktos, Georgios Pattaktenis and Kali in the Byzantine year 6866 (1357-58).",1357,2024,2382,1347,Nicolyna Enriquez,2024-04-04 21:01:00.971 +0200,2024-04-04 21:01:00.971 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH)
2306,"Church of St. Demetrios, Platanes (Selino), Crete",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The church of St. Demetrios, dated by inscription to the year 1372-1373 is located in the village of Platanes (Selino). The church is comprised of a single nave with a barrel vault interior and saddle roof exterior. The exterior has, more recently, been whitewashed. A transverse arch inside of the church creates two bays with a large modern iconostasis built just to the east of the transverse arch. The paintings are generally well preserved, and the church is well lit.
	The sanctuary apse has Christ Pantocrator above four co-officiating bishops: St. Nicholas, St. John Chrysostom, St. Basil, and St. Athanasius of Alexandria. On the triumphal arch there is the Mandylion above the apse followed by the Annunciation and finally the images of the deacon saint Stephen on the left of the apse and St. Cyril of Alexandria on the right. The northern wall of the sanctuary includes St. Eleutherius along with two unidentified bishop saints. The southern wall has two additional unidentified bishop saints. The vault of the sanctuary shows the Ascension of Christ along with a band of four prophets, David, Aaron, Solomon, and Moses. The Ten Martyrs of Crete are shown across the archway dividing the sanctuary from the nave.
	The barrel vault of the nave shows additional scenes from the life of Christ including the Nativity, the Hypapante, the Raising of Lazarus and the Baptism of Christ. Among the gallery of saints lining the northern wall we have the titular saint, St. Demetrios, on horseback, alongside four standing military saints: St. Theodore, St. Nestor, St. Procopius, and St. Menas. The southern wall’s gallery of saints includes the standing figures of Sts. Constantine and Helena, the Archangel Michael, and St. Onouphrius. 
	The western wall has the image of the Crucifixion in the tympanum. To the left of the entrance, St. Marina stands alongside another unidentified female saint while St. Zosimas and St. Mary of Egypt are on the right side of the entrance.
	The badly damaged dedicatory inscription is now mostly illegible.

2307,"Church of the Panagia and Christ the Savior, Roustika (Rethymnon), Crete",50,Religious Place (v1.2),"The twin basilica churches dedicated to the Dormition of the Virgin and the Transfiguration of Christ are located in the center of the village of Roustika in the Rethymnon province. Dated by inscription to 1390-91, only the northern church, the one dedicated to the Panagia retains its paintings in good condition. Each of the two churches has a pointed barrel vault interior and a saddle roof exterior. Two later archways, one in the nave and one in the sanctuary, connect the two churches from the inside. Incorporated at an unknown date, these two internal archways damaged several of the surrounding paintings. Each church is divided into three bays by the addition of two transverse arches. 
	The sanctuary of the Church of the Panagia, divided today by a modern wooden iconostasis, is decorated with a badly damaged image of the Virgin Platytera with an image of the Holy Trinity in the form of the Throne of Mercy in the triumphal arch. Below the Holy Trinity are the Virgin and the Archangel Gabriel forming the Annunciation. The apse is decorated with six co-officiating bishops including St. Nicholas, St. John Chrysostom, St. Basil, St. John Eleëmon (the Almsgiver), and St. Gregory of Nazianzus. The figures along the southern wall are damaged but St. Eleutherius, St. Sophronius of Jerusalem, and the bust of St. Eytychius of Constantinople are preserved along the northern wall.
	The barrel vault of the sanctuary includes scenes from the Life of Christ including the Ascension, the Anastasis, the Incredulity of Thomas, and the Empty Sepulcher (along the northern half), and Christ appearing to the Apostles, the Raising of Lazarus, and the Entry into Jerusalem (on the southern half). Below these scenes are additional scenes from the Life of the Virgin including the Prayer of St. Anne, the Annunciation to Joachim, and the Meeting of Joachim and Anne. The archways which divide the church into three bays are painted with the Prophets David, Solomon, Jonah and Isaiah on the eastern arch, and St. Barbara, St. Catherine, St. Marina, St. Anastasia, St. Irene, and St. Paraskevi on the western arch.
	The middle bay of the church holds 24 small scenes divided into a grid pattern on both the northern and southern parts of the vault. These scenes relate to the 24 stanzas of the Akathistos, a hymn dedicated to the Virgin. Each scene is related to the life of the Virgin and the early life of Christ. Below these scenes on the northern wall is the church’s dedicatory inscription above a window. The inscription notes that the church was built and decorated through the efforts of Georgios V(la)tas and his wife in the Byzantine year 6899 (1390-91). On either side of the window are the heavily damaged images of St. Photini and St. Leontius. The only standing saints remaining below the southern wall are St. Onouphrius and another unidentified saint. 
	The vault of the western bay includes additional scenes from the Life of Christ including the Betrayal of Judas, the Helkomenos, the Crucifixion, and the Deposition from the Cross. Below these scenes are images from the Last Judgment including an image of Paradise, on the southern wall, and scenes of the Sea and the Land giving up their Dead on the northern wall. The gallery of saints in the western bay includes, on the southern wall, the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, and on the northern wall three military saints on horseback: St. George, St. Theodore Stratelates, and St. Demetrios.

It surveys the Libyan Sea to the south and Mount Kofinas, the highest peak of the Asterousia mountain range, to the east. Dated by inscription to the Byzantine year 6910 (1401-2) the vaulted nave of the church is divided into two bays by a transverse arch. A narthex, whose pointed barrel vault is higher than that of the nave, is positioned on the western side of the building and is connected to the nave by means of an archway. The wall paintings in both the church and narthex are generally well preserved and include one of the most extensive cycles of the Life of the Virgin in Byzantine art. The inclusion of a large number of holy monks in the decorative program indicate that the church functioned as a katholikon, the main church of a monastery. Indeed, the church once belonged to the now destroyed Monastery of Vathmou (later the Monastery of the Panagia of Kyrie Eleison). This function is also confirmed by the dedicatory inscription which names the “hieromonachos (ordained monk) and spiritual father, the priest Grigorios Kalamaras” as the church’s sponsor.
	The wall paintings of the sanctuary include the Virgin and Child in the half dome of the apse flanked by two angels in medallions. Below this image are four co-officiating bishops flanking the Melismos. Above the sanctuary, on the triumphal arch, is the image of God as the Ancient of Days flanked by the four Evangelists. Below this image is the Annunciation, although only the Archangel Gabriel can still be distinguished today. Inside the conch of the prothesis niche (on the left side of the apse) is the image of Christ as the Man of Sorrow. Above the niche is the deacon St. Stephen. Two bishop saints are located along the northern wall of the sanctuary while three bishop saints and one male saint are located on the southern wall. The vault of the sanctuary has an image of the Ascension of Christ.
	The nave of the church is decorated with scenes from the Christological Cycle including the Baptism of Christ, the Transfiguration, the Raising of Lazarus, and the Entry into Jerusalem. The gallery of saints along the southern wall has four unidentified male saints while the northern wall’s gallery of saints includes three unidentified saints and St. Constantine and Helena. The Koimesis (the Dormition of the Virgin) is painted on the western wall above the archway connecting the nave to the narthex. This archway is then flanked by two hymnographers. St. Peter (south) and St. Paul (north) decorate the interior of the archway.
	The barrel vault of the narthex along its eastern side holds additional images relating to the Christological cycle including six scenes from the Passion of Christ and scenes from Christ’s healing miracles. The western side of the barrel vault shows eighteen scenes from the Life of the Virgin along with scenes of Paradise and the Last Judgment.

The triumphal arch has the image of the Mandylion at the top above the images of the Virgin and the Archangel Gabriel from the Annunciation. Below, on either side of the apse are the deacon saints St. Stephen and St. Romanus. The southern wall of the sanctuary has the image of St. Nicholas, turned towards the apse (similar to the position of the co-officiating bishops). He stands next to a Deesis. The northern wall of the sanctuary shows another unidentified bishop saint similarly turning towards the apse (like St. Nicholas) standing next to three male saints (of which only St. Anthony can be determined). In the barrel vault of the Sanctuary are scenes of the Nativity and the Ascension of Christ.
The nave includes scenes both from the Christological cycle, including the Hypapante, the Entombment and the Crucifixion, and from the Life of St. Isidore, including St. Isidore in Prison and his Decapitation.
